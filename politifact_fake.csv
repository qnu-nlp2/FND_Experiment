politifact15014,speedtalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=51650,BREAKING: First NFL Team Declares Bankruptcy Over Kneeling Thugs,"The world is edging toward a major conservation target for protected land and oceans, but there are concerns over how safeguarded areas are managed and whether they are effectively protecting endangered species, according to a new report. Nearly 15% of the Earthâ€™s land, covering around 20m sq km, is contained in national parks or other protected areas. This figure has flatlined over the past year, largely because of improved data collection, but is close to an internationally agreed goal to protect 17% of the land surface by 2020. There has been a faster rate of progress in ocean conservation, albeit of a low base. Around 4% of the total surface of the ocean, covering 15m sq km, is now protected. This area, roughly the size of Russia, has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But the progress report by the UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warns that some of the most biodiverse ecosystems are not being protected and that the management of many protected areas is deficient.  Less than 20% of areas considered crucial hubs for species are fully protected, the report states, with countries routinely failing to assess the effectiveness of their national parks nor provide wildlife corridors that allow animals to roam between protected areas. Restricting hunting, mining and other development helps speciesâ€™ overall survival chances, with the report stating that global populations of terrestrial species in protected areas suffered an average decline of 18% from 1970 to 2010, compared to a 39% loss for species when unprotected areas are included. â€œEcological factors such as park size, fragmentation and connectivity are fundamentally important in the long term, but are often superseded by   social and economic factors,â€ the report, presented at the IUCN congress in Hawaii, found. â€œProtected areas can have positive impacts on species extinction risk and population trends, but they need to be properly sited and managed to realize their full potential. â€  Erik Solheim, head of UN environment, said that â€œhuge gainsâ€ have been made in the quantity of protected areas, but this had to be matched by their quality.  â€œThe world needs to do more to effectively protect our most biologically diverse spaces,â€ he said. â€œProtected areas need to be better connected, to allow populations of animals and plants to mix and spread. Also important is ensuring local communities are involved in protection efforts. Their support is fundamental to   conservation. â€  Countries in South America and the Caribbean protect the largest portion of their land, with Brazil accounting for the worldâ€™s largest safeguarded system, spanning 2. 47m sq km. Countries in the Middle East, by contrast, protect just 119, 000 sq km, or around 3% of the areaâ€™s landmass.  Some nations are moving towards including biodiversity values in their national accounts, such as the UK, which has accounted for the value of air quality and recreation in areas such as the Lake District. But other nations continue to subsidize ecologically harmful practices, such as Thailandâ€™s support for a shrimp farming industry that is resulting in the destruction of mangroves.  Marine reserves have grown thanks to new measures taken by countries including Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Spain. The report does not include the recent creation of the worldâ€™s largest ocean reserve by the US, off the   islands of Hawaii.  Conservationists are pushing for far greater efforts to protect marine life, with a resolution put to the IUCN congress that nations aim for 30% of the oceans to be protected. While terrestrial ecosystems are affected by climate change, poaching and mass land conversion for agriculture, the warming, acidifying oceans are possibly faring even worse with less protected area.   Dan Laffoley, a marine adviser for the IUCN, said the 30% target is â€œimportant, absolutely critical, but we need to think beyond those targets. We need to protect much more of the ocean, only about 1% is strictly protected.   â€œWith the knowledge we have, we need more than that. We need a far more strategic, connected approach if we are going to get out of this mess. â€",836,437,"937349434668498944	937379378006282240	937380068590055425	937384406511005696	937387493451862016	937400766024896512	937406789686980608	937411332240011266	937415066810503168	937427631661768704	937429898670600192	937436145004302337	937438119468699648	937449906352152576	937450317142286336	937451599320027136	937452013939494912	937452151227510784	937453119478423553	937462176293437443	937468710952013824	937471159246950401	937473844813508609	937474875861749760	937481780088598528	937485222257586177	937491440082522117	937491843851231232	937493781271732229	937494245883068421	937506043604750338	937506080694947840	937508442352373760	937510057322995712	937520724453089280	937520726369816576	937521928738185216	937522668303147010	937522695339638785	937524138121478144	937526251027402753	937541294951411712	937542730162540544	937543928844374016	937567120220618752	937616001570672640	937628495865196544	937688299757588485	937692378604941317	937693047458025474	937696540453466112	937703980158935040	937737858726744064	937738398080622592	937739985113018368	937742668393734145	937749996098555911	937756485630808065	937757406129479682	937764315544907782	937764314500476929	937787346019340288	937787353824931840	937798800453918723	937808118695608320	937813631281934337	937832949453590528	937842520364584960	937845355282075650	937845358650101761	937855193483501568	937856552660295680	937864937820639239	937870723078639616	937900837086597120	937913933414981632	937920200514703366	937929101620404224	937936039510990848	938008154125885440	938068477276860416	938079298157760512	938100808083738624	938103147054161920	938165596730134528	938196044285923328	938211896431448064	938289136703823872	938353893443977216	938362786287058944	938600814914031616	938620649215528960	938776353049939968	938946906444660737	938988970653786112	939053016010735616	939089302167973888	939272833427034112	939272836887261186	939445960865968128	939461705528168448	939468815628488707	939985451036938245	940980953299783680	940987185859383296	941026788964102144	941044474905423872	941080636852523013	941471287054094337	941829442665553920	942182775024734208	942369156254576641	942421857634004998	942750575267106817	942966219799515136	944057586374103045	944202537976156160	944582624282120193	945092931844804608	946194743779717122	946570019860897792	946901429112967168	946913385211465728	946917851243393024	946935469216059393	947133585886269440	952689244400734208	952709650444668928	952727017983705089	953420038819733504	957810295442956288	957848606215737344	958020350599577600	959618726734655488	959796911778693120	959850069037109250	959953238807126016	959970102962683905	960005452980523009	960161342651998208	960208102820859904	960215718905118720	960215720071188480	960215758809845760	960225064590327808	960241750102159361	960536863793655809	960565604305350657	960596323207696384	960639325242347520	960872764889550848	960912756093353984	960935344068841472	960944324107276294	960967219365797888	961021342375202817	961049817886707712	961049833208532995	961081215678930944	961355701321904128	961355708750090240	961639675277529094	1027743374357536768",fake
politifact15156,politics2020.info/index.php/2018/03/13/court-orders-obama-to-pay-400-million-in-restitution/,Court Orders Obama To Pay $400 Million In Restitution,"House Republicans investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, have found no new evidence to conclude that Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, was culpable in the deaths of four Americans, according to the committeeâ€™s final report released on Tuesday. The   document released by the Republicans on the House select committee on Benghazi brought to a close a fiercely partisan,   $7m investigation that included interviews with more than 80 witnesses. The report reveals new details about the night of the attack and concludes that the Obama administration failed to recognize the possibility of it happening. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, his state department colleague Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed when Islamist militants stormed the US consulate in Benghazi on 11 September 2012. Controversy has raged ever since over the chain of events and how much support the men had from Washington. The White House noted tersely that this was the eighth congressional committee to investigate the attacks and went on longer than the   commission and the committees designated to look at Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President John F Kennedy, the   affair and Watergate. It accused Republicans of pursuing â€œwild conspiracy theoriesâ€. Committee chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina, denied that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Clinton was the target. â€œWhen the select committee was formed, I promised to conduct this investigation in a manner worthy of the American peopleâ€™s respect, and worthy of the memory of those who died,â€ he said. â€œThat is exactly what my colleagues and I have done. Now, I simply ask the American people to read this report for themselves, look at the evidence we have collected, and reach their own conclusions. â€ But a split emerged among Republicans on the committee. Two members, Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, issued a   supplementary report more forthright in its criticism. It says: â€œWhat we did find was a tragic failure of leadership  â€”   in the   to the attack and the night of  â€”   and an administration that, so blinded by politics and its desire to win an election, disregarded a basic duty of government: tell the people the truth. And for those reasons Benghazi is, and always will be, an American tragedy. â€ Jordan, from Ohio, and Pompeo, from Kansas, were equally blunt in their condemnation of Clinton in particular. â€œSecretary Clinton and the administration told one story privately  â€”   that Benghazi was a terrorist attack  â€”   and told another story publicly  â€”   blaming a   protest,â€ they wrote. Pressed on whether he believed that Clinton lied, Gowdy declined to give a direct answer, telling journalists to read the report. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to decide that for yourself,â€ he said. The committeeâ€™s Democrats, who have long derided the investigation as politically motivated, on Monday released their own report on the committeeâ€™s findings. â€œAlthough the select committee obtained additional details that provide context and granularity, these details do not fundamentally alter the previous conclusions,â€ the Democratsâ€™ report said. Donald Trump has used the incident to discredit Clintonâ€™s time at the helm of the state department. In a speech last week, he said Clinton â€œspread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims was our late ambassador Chris Stevensâ€. And on Tuesday Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, weighed in: â€œThe new information in the majorityâ€™s report on the Benghazi terrorist attack makes clear that Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration engaged in a politically motivated   weeks before the 2012 presidential election. â€œHillary Clinton knew the night of the attack it had nothing to do with an internet video, and yet she shamefully peddled this false narrative to the American public and to the victimsâ€™ families. This in itself is a disqualifying act of deception. â€ Clinton, campaigning in Denver, said: â€œI understand that after more than two years and $7m spent by the Benghazi committee under taxpayer funds, it had to today report that it had found nothing  â€”   nothing  â€”   to contradict the conclusions that the independent accountability board, or the conclusions of the prior multiple earlier investigations carried out on a bipartisan basis in the Congress. â€ She added: â€œSo while this unfortunately took on a partisan tinge, I want us to stay focused on what Iâ€™ve always wanted us to stay focused on, and that is the important work of diplomacy and development. â€ The Democratic nominee added: â€œThatâ€™s especially true in dangerous places. We cannot withdraw or retreat from the world. America needs a presence for a lot of reasons, and the best way to honor the commitment and sacrifice of those weâ€™ve lost is to redouble our efforts to provide resources and support that our diplomats and development groups deserve. So, Iâ€™ll leave it to others to characterize this report, but I think itâ€™s pretty clear that itâ€™s time to move on. â€ In Washington, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, condemned the report claiming it dealt in â€œpolitically motivated fantasiesâ€ and accused Republicans of â€œcynically trying to capitalise on the deaths of four innocent Americans who were killed overseasâ€.  Asked if he believed this finally drew a line under the Benghazi issue, Earnest replied: â€œI thought it was over after the first five investigations. This was the eighth. â€ He called on the Republican National Committee to correctly report the   contributions for the $7m investigation in its next filing with the Federal Election Commission. In October, Clinton endured 11 hours of questioning by the House select committee, and was roundly commended for her performance during the marathon hearing while the chairman was criticized for failing to produce any new information about the 2012 attack. The hearing was a turning point for Clintonâ€™s campaign. On the trail, Democrats still refer to her    performance as a testament to her endurance and ability to withstand and overcome partisan attacks. The report faults the military for its slow response sending resources to the Libyan city during the deadly 2012 attacks on a US outpost, despite clear orders from Barack Obama and the then US defense secretary Leon Panetta. Gowdy said â€œnothing was en route to Libya at the time the last two Americans were killed almost eight hours after the attacks beganâ€. He said the Libyan forces that evacuated Americans from the CIA annex in Benghazi were not affiliated with any of the militias the CIA or state department had developed a relationship with during the previous 18 months. Gowdy said on Tuesday that the report documents that the US was slow to send help to the Americans in Benghazi â€œbecause of an obsession with hurting the Libyansâ€™ feelingsâ€. He said the report was not aimed at Clinton, but portrays â€œseries of heroic actsâ€ by Americans under attack â€œand what we can do to preventâ€ other assaults. The Democratsâ€™ report released on Monday saying that while the state departmentâ€™s security measures in Benghazi the night of 11 September 2012 were â€œwoefully inadequateâ€ Clinton never personally turned down a request for additional security. Democrats said the military could not have done anything differently that night to save the lives of the Americans. On Tuesday, the panelâ€™s Democrats denounced the Republicansâ€™ report as â€œa conspiracy theory on steroids  â€”   bringing back   allegations with no credible evidence whatsoeverâ€.  The state department also issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that the â€œessential factsâ€ of the attacks â€œhave been known for some timeâ€ and have been the subject of numerous reviews, including one by an independent review board.

Eden Hazard rolled back the months with a display reminiscent of his role in Chelseaâ€™s title victory last season but it is his country, not his club, that stands to benefit from his return to fitness and form. Chelseaâ€™s away support chanted for a new contract for John Terry and unveiled a banner showing the trophies won under his stewardship complete with a call to â€œsign him upâ€. Yet the performance of their mesmerising No10 showed there are other, younger assets that Stamford Bridge can   to lose this summer. Hazard capped a fine evening with an outstanding individual goal, only his fourth in the Premier League this season, and his recovery comes just in time for Belgiumâ€™s Euro 2016 campaign. But Guus Hiddinkâ€™s team paid the price for failing to kill the contest in the second half. â€œHe had a difficult year,â€ Hiddink, Chelseaâ€™s interim manager, said of the Belgian. â€œHe was one of the best last year and this year he was falling into injury, coming back nearly, falling back into injury and that made him vulnerable physically. You get frustrated. The last few weeks he has been working on a programme to be fully fit and now steadily he has got his shape and then you can see what he is able to do. He has a lot of talent, is clever and can play   . He is conceding a lot of physical contacts but he goes on and it is nice to see. He is physically and mentally fit and it is a pleasure to see those sort of players. â€ For JÃ¼rgen Klopp, there was an element of fortune in Liverpoolâ€™s unbeaten run at Anfield reaching game No13. A ninth Premier League defeat beckoned in the managerâ€™s 50th match in charge until the Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was deceived by Sheyi Ojoâ€™s cross and pushed the ball on to the head of the waiting Benteke. The combination of the two Liverpool substitutes for the equaliser reflected well on the teamâ€™s attitude and the managerâ€™s decision to go for broke, but Klopp will need much more from what appeared his Europa League final side when it reconvenes against Sevilla next week. Klopp said: â€œFor the first 15 minutes we played wonderful football without scoring and I said after the game it was the most important game of the season. We showed in the first 15 minutes what we were capable of. There was not enough faith in our own quality and so we lost patience and when you lose patience it is always difficult and we lost formation. â€œWe didnâ€™t defend together but we invested a lot and that made us tired. That was the problem of the game. Maybe they could have scored the second one but Simon Mignolet did brilliantly and Kolo [TourÃ©] and Dejan [Lovren] saved our life at this moment. We had two or three really good moments and we used one to get a draw. The last 10 minutes it was not too lucky but we could have lost today. â€ Hazard opened the scoring with a quite exquisite goal. There was minimal threat to the home defence when the playmaker collected possession deep in the Liverpool half and even after exchanging passes with Cesc FÃ bregas. But then he accelerated past four weak challenges with a deft touch and a drop of the shoulder and, from the edge of the penalty area, swept an outstanding finish into the far corner of Mignoletâ€™s goal. It served as a reminder of the form and talent that brought Hazard player of the year awards last season and has been sorely missed at Stamford Bridge for the majority of this campaign. Bertrand TraorÃ©, the youngster Tammy Abraham and Hazard all had chances to secure the away win but, with Mignolet saving well and opportunities wasted, Liverpool always had hope of a reprieve. Benteke provided it with a   header before Klopp led his squad on a lap of anticipation. It is now all about Sevilla.",373,420,"929405740732870656	929439450400264192	929439484806037506	929484662145208320	929498602539450368	929503730961125376	929507420056961024	929507659073687552	929507837872623616	929508015035658240	929517614321238016	929521804665909248	929523849179299841	929528504198328320	929533921422925834	929536359999705088	929538113482846208	929546218836865024	929549017087922177	929552302196887552	929553802444685312	929554103663058950	929555180273549312	929562954042880000	929566605331390464	929569280303292416	929570723429076992	929572801727619073	929573118972256256	929579970975821824	929586902407061504	929591704339996673	929596621687418880	929598212717076480	929608411267915777	929621755659825152	929633542526722048	929642337151565824	929642678375059457	929646571276374017	929654820528631808	929658503622529024	929663480344563712	929669052544569344	929674946229538821	929677634396721153	929692643394760712	929696201561264129	929699828304506881	929701430407122944	929704328927109120	929706367639851008	929715008543567874	929718624994189312	929720063900430336	929720336760832001	929720978795528192	929721228553748480	929722871911501824	929725604110331905	929726354794405888	929732664990375936	929732700746874880	929740940075417601	929741082681753600	929741308809199616	929749109455671296	929754487996248065	929756897451888640	929758263402467329	929760229767729152	929762542943129600	929763822709235717	929764338218471424	929764784022499328	929765703510577153	929768000768659462	929772377797472257	929772559016411136	929773846927781888	929777322760294401	929777438611165186	929778929438724096	929781509002809345	929786806018732032	929789389613363204	929791693259493376	929793613827006464	929794547290443776	929796036381630465	929796238547005440	929796307031642112	929799675237904384	929800780097445889	929800855972450305	929801632425979904	929802455373832194	929804250972086272	929811075679293440	929811411479547905	929811833908801536	929812030780981248	929812539063619584	929812844723372032	929816205745061888	929825453229182979	929825556320935942	929825840434696192	929837115164233729	929838341075456001	929844369741570048	929846646795464704	929853496773443585	929869548278476800	929873977513783297	929879068253868035	929886182141460480	929888231352619008	929889912933048320	929895483480223744	929897870563692547	929909026879569922	929915078706630656	929924791829745665	929932205165547520	929933603374497792	929939717960978432	929944525023277058	929967631397982209	930015697199022080	930025860857556993	930033928257310720	930060792824848384	930075458657554432	930087245457117185	930088520961708033	930093457686827008	930131789062070272	930133721977704448	930167421507424257	930170937185570818	930175659560890368	930177680485388288	930178369433546752	930200501836120065	930214078362120192	930240024246870017	930254315784110080	930287231826264066	930333556089303048	930345067671441414	930357308974133248	930389504770367488	930400162723389442	930463273664876545	930523505828990976	930538518123810816	930548895280660480	930586571639750656	930597786898391042	930697186500804609	930813851016351744	930839926979080193	930841245211156480	930863988283359233	930904305464500225	930910553668648960	930913962312396800	930946860918951936	930975493465272320	930976327544590336	930977825988820992	930985367368552448	931002503021453312	931014982560636928	931034467967422464	931080048832020480	931142637393981441	931172650038181888	931182332928712704	931199160736501760	931202494713167872	931207544579731456	931226684094808064	931245925724549120	931255075686768640	931256569727033344	931272284899237888	931591061176119296	931624545567625216	931728670942674944	931796675051470849	931832539915923456	931912892781420550	931933588483911680	931986758602018817	932103094321799168	932295227485884423	932424495037665283	932768534282756096	932819961252327424	932874928977833984	933093127384055808	933372086420111360	933809596824633344	933841176339341312	933841196467785733	934204051427905538	934222942283513861	934248395732070401	934298790365941760	934332488192798720	934473685817282567	934576562732785665	934600252719620096	934717638391025665	934764706736279552	934822452257001478	934989373661212672	935696508569178112",fake
politifact14355,https://howafrica.com/oscar-pistorius-attempts-commit-suicide/,Oscar Pistorius Attempts To Commit Suicide,"Lights flashing, three police cars showed up to Bill  â€™s quiet suburban street on the morning of 15 December 2015. The Benicia, California, man had stayed up all night waiting for the sheriffâ€™s office to evict him from the house his grandparents had owned since 1971. â€œIt was really, really traumatic,â€   recalled one year later. Standing outside the locked front door, the    peered into the empty living room that holds his earliest Christmas memories and surveyed the overgrown ivy damaging the houseâ€™s facade. The foreclosure  â€”   which he said was based on a predatory loan and improper paperwork  â€”   originated with lender OneWest Bank, at the time run by chairman and CEO Steven Mnuchin. The veteran Wall Street financierâ€™s foreclosure practices are receiving fresh scrutiny this week after   Donald Trump announced him as the nominee for US Treasury secretary. â€œRather than shaking up Wall Street, he installs the very person that was part of the financial mess,â€ said   who has effectively been homeless since the foreclosure. â€œIâ€™m just thoroughly disgusted. â€ Mnuchin, who is also a Hollywood movie producer, earned the nickname â€œforeclosure kingâ€ after he purchased distressed mortgages during the financial crisis and evicted thousands of homeowners. The former Goldman Sachs banker, worth an estimated $40m, has no government experience, and critics worry that, as Treasury secretary, his policies could benefit the wealthiest people and roll back critical bank regulations. One controversial source of OneWest foreclosures is the corporationâ€™s reverse mortgages, which are loans to elderly homeowners that enable them to borrow against their home equity. These types of mortgages have been aggressively marketed to seniors as a way to help them stay in their homes, but some donâ€™t understand the risks and canâ€™t afford associated fees. In 2006,  â€™s grandparents bought a reverse mortgage from IndyMac Bank, the predecessor to OneWest, which he said took advantage of his grandfather, who suffered from dementia.  After his grandparents died in 2012,   moved in, but the corporation  â€”   by then OneWest and run by Mnuchin  â€”   quickly began foreclosure proceedings.  The bankâ€™s case, he said, relied on a document signed with the name â€œBryan Blyâ€ who has been widely reported in numerous investigations as a   â€œ â€.   are individuals whose signatures are wrongfully used to automatically authenticate thousands of mortgage documents that they havenâ€™t read and are in some cases falsely notarized.  The document, which an auditor determined was improper, makes his foreclosure illegitimate,   said, adding: â€œItâ€™s elder financial abuse. â€ His family is still fighting the foreclosure, but in the meantime  â€™s mother has been forced to live in a nursing home. The California Reinvestment Coalition, a   that has scrutinized OneWest, found through public records requests that the bank disproportionately foreclosed on seniors. The firm was allegedly responsible for 39% of reverse mortgages in recent years even though it only has 17% of the market.  From 2009 to 2015, the bank was responsible for more than 36, 000 total foreclosures in California, according to the coalition.  Julie Cheney, a California resident whose parents lost their home to a OneWest foreclosure stemming from a reverse mortgage, testified against OneWest before it merged with a company called CIT Group last year. (Mnuchin earned millions from the sale).  â€œItâ€™s so wrong,â€ Cheney said, explaining that the bank sold her parents a mortgage they didnâ€™t need while her father was dying of cancer and on pain medication and her mother was suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s disease.  Her familyâ€™s unsuccessful court battle against OneWest was a huge strain on her mother right before she died, Cheney added. â€œIt was the worst time of my life. â€  Maeve Elise Brown, executive director of Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, said some of the cruelest OneWest evictions she has observed involve foreclosures against recently widowed homeowners. â€œItâ€™s unimaginable. People are still traumatized from the death of their loved one,â€ she said, â€œand then they are faced with the second largest loss, which is the roof over their head. â€  CIT Group and Trumpâ€™s transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Foreclosures arenâ€™t the only way OneWest has inflicted harm on vulnerable people, according to critics.  In November, two   filed a complaint against the bank, alleging that it has violated the Fair Housing Act by failing to locate branches in communities of color and providing disproportionately low rates of loans to Asian Americans, African Americans and Latinos in California.  In   neighborhoods, OneWest was far more likely to foreclose on homes than make loans available, according to the charges, which claim that in 2014 and 2015, the corporation offered only two loans to black borrowers.  The complaint, which calls for an investigation by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, further accuses the corporation of allowing foreclosed properties to become blighted and abandoned in communities of color, while properly maintaining and marketing homes in white neighborhoods.  â€œThere is a very high price to pay in terms of the health and safety of the neighborhood,â€ said Caroline Peattie, executive director of the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California, which filed the complaint alongside the reinvestment coalition.  In white neighborhoods, OneWest properties generally had â€œmanicured lawns, securely locked doors and windows, and attractive, professional, â€˜for saleâ€™ signs posted out frontâ€ according to the complaint. In communities of color, the foreclosed houses â€œwere more likely to have trash strewn about the premises, overgrown grass, shrubbery, and weeds, and boarded or broken doors and windowsâ€. Blighted properties can attract garbage, crime and public safety hazards, she said, adding that studies have found that living near foreclosures is linked to higher blood pressure.  â€œItâ€™s as if a lender has turned the personâ€™s home into a piece of trash,â€ said Brown. â€œAny lender who does not maintain the property is victimizing the entire neighborhood. â€",795,254,"886941526458347521	887011300278194176	887023043121434625	887071646376448000	887096424105627648	887316457977253896	887365700683255813	887401274399961090	887593873555542016	887754918584561664	887793804769501184	887798752546869250	887829850123366400	887846701972701184	887980059008487424	887983460152782848	888041580657082368	888137991599869954	888168766441488385	888175337472970753	888338029856907264	889450634419875840",fake
politifact15371,http://washingtonsources.org/trump-votes-for-death-penalty-for-being-gay-5/,Trump Votes For Death Penalty For Being Gay,"Last Friday was a big day for voting rights in the United States. Federal courts struck down restrictive voting laws in Kansas and Wisconsin. And in a particularly important decision, the fourth circuit court of appeals delivered a stinging rebuke to North Carolinaâ€™s egregious vote suppression law. As the court observed, North Carolina legislators didnâ€™t even try to hide the core purpose of the law: to stop African Americans from getting to the polls. The politics of North Carolina are a perfect illustration of what led the Republican party to nominate Trump. The southern state, which has seen a large influx of people into its prosperous urban centers, is becoming more liberal  â€”   Barack Obama carried the state in 2008, and Mitt Romney carried it by only two points in 2012. North Carolina Republicans have not reacted to these trends, however, by becoming more moderate.  The clash between a Republican party running at full speed to the right while its population was trending to the left led North Carolina to pass a particularly terrible   law. In 2013, a bare majority of the US supreme court gave the green light to North Carolina by striking down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states, such as North Carolina, that had a history of discrimination to preclear electoral law changes with the Department of Justice. In addition to a requirement that voters show particular forms of ID, the state eliminated Sunday voting, narrowed the window for early voting and eliminated   vote registration and early registration for   and   olds. Voter ID requirements at least have the superficial appearance of addressing the integrity of elections, although in practice the justification is bogus. But most of the provisions in North Carolinaâ€™s attack on the right to vote had no purpose, even in theory, other than to make it harder for people to vote. Or, to put it more accurately, make it harder for some people to vote. In a careful, detailed, and absolutely devastating opinion for a unanimous   panel, Judge Diana Motz demonstrated that the law â€œtarget[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precisionâ€. The discriminatory intent that could be clearly inferred from the nature of the statute itself was not well hidden.  As Motz pointed out: â€œ[B]efore enacting that law, the legislature requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans. â€ When you request data about how changes in vote laws will affect the African American vote, and then change laws in ways deliberately designed to suppress it, thereâ€™s really no room left for doubt.  The story in Wisconsin is similar, although its legislature was a little better at hiding its tracks. Republicans in the state have used lower   turnouts to win elections and pursue a very aggressive conservative agenda in a state that perennially votes Democratic in presidential elections. It passed vote restrictions that disproportionately affect people of color and the poor, and these restrictions were also struck down on Friday. Both of these decisions materially affect the elections in November. Not only will Trump be targeting North Carolina and Wisconsin both states have Senate elections, with control of the chamber responsible for confirming (or not confirming) supreme court nominees looking to come down to the wire. The nakedness of these vote suppression tactics is so obvious that earlier in July, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals struck down similar legislation in Texas. While the supreme court made it harder to challenge these tactics by gutting the voting rights law, there are still remedies available and federal courts have finally begun to push back against these attempts to suppress the votes of people of color and the poor. These are important victories. But they also underscore the importance of getting a supreme court majority that will fight back against vote suppression rather than facilitating it.

politifact14404,gloria.tv/video/yRrtUtTCfPga6cq2VDJPcgQe4,Putin says: ‘Pope Francis Is Not A Man Of God’ | Must-See !!,"Scientists have found tantalizing evidence of a liquid water ocean swirling under the icy shell of Jupiterâ€™s moon Europa, Nasa announced on Monday, with new evidence of water plumes bursting out into space. With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, the scientists observed Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. â€œIf plumes exist, this is an exciting find,â€ lead researcher William Sparks said. â€œIt means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals,â€ he added. â€œIt would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. â€ The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. â€œWe presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because thatâ€™s what Europaâ€™s made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed. â€ With other instruments, he said, the scientists could search for hydrogen, oxygen and other chemicals that could hint to what the ocean is made up of.  Europa is one of the most active bodies in the solar system: about the size of Earthâ€™s moon, and at its warmest only about   ( ) and covered in an icy shell that makes one of the most reflective objects in the neighborhood. But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating  â€”   the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant. Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. â€œFor a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth,â€ Nasa astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. â€œWeâ€™re lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically. â€œWe have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics. Europa might be such a place. â€ The finding, Nasaâ€™s astrophysicist Paul Hertz said, â€œincreases our confidence that water and other materials in Europaâ€™s ocean, Europaâ€™s hidden ocean, might be . .. available for us to study without us landing and digging on those unknown miles of iceâ€. Scientists have collected clues for decades of an ocean beneath Europaâ€™s icy shell. In 1979, Voyager spacecraft showed that the ice was cracked in some places, like ice floes on Earth, and the 1990s Galileo mission, which spent eight years orbiting Jupiter, confirmed the ocean under Europa. A 2016 study suggested that Europa produces 10 times more oxygen than hydrogen, and a 2014 study suggested the moon may have plate tectonics, qualities that would make it like Earth. Nasa scientists have been working on proposals for a Europa mission for 15 years, and has a tentative plan to send a spacecraft on a flyby near the moon in the 2020s, zipping past its intense,   radiation field. The ESA has also planned a mission to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) which will aim to orbit the moon Ganymede and collect data and Europa and a third moon, Callisto. â€œThe Europa flyby is not a   mission,â€ said program scientist Curt Niebur. â€œThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa. â€  Niebur said that Nasa was well versed in evaluating habitability, but had little in its history evaluating for life. â€œWhen it comes to finding life we donâ€™t have as much experience, and we have an ongoing and vigorous debate in the scientific community when it goes to finding out. â€ Sparks and Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman similarly downplayed the chances that a flyby mission could find direct evidence of life. â€œBy the time it gets into space, with radiation and cryogenic temperature, itâ€™s not going to survive,â€ he said. â€œThe juryâ€™s out,â€ said Wiseman. â€œIt first depends on whether the plumes are really there. â€ Should the plumes exist, a spacecraft orbiting Europa could collect samples from plumes to get a taste of what Hertz called â€œa global saline liquid water oceanâ€ that â€œengulfs the moon at the present time, hidden under miles of iceâ€. Last year Nasaâ€™s Cassini spacecraft dove into the plumes erupting from Saturnâ€™s moon Enceladus, finding ice and dust that revealed qualities of the moonâ€™s ocean. â€œIt has revealed a tremendous amount of information about the ocean that is present beneath Enceladusâ€™ ice shell,â€ Hertz said. â€œWe would kill to have that kind of information and data about Europa. â€ Sparks said the observations announced today were actually made in 2014, only a year after Nasa researchers saw what they believed to be evidence of water vapor plumes shooting 120 miles into space from Europaâ€™s south pole. â€œItâ€™s not just taking a picture,â€ Sparks said. â€œItâ€™s a rather complicated way of observing. â€ He said that engineers had to develop the software to analyze a table of observed events, about 50 miles in total, and that the researchers continued to observe the moon throughout.

Authorities named the woman killed and revealed that train engineer Thomas Grayling has answered investigatorsâ€™ questions and was cooperating, after being released from hospital following the crash at a major transportation hub in Hoboken during Thursday morningâ€™s rush hour. But the cause of the crash, and whether it could have been prevented by safety devices, remains unclear.  Rail investigators have pulled one of the trainâ€™s black box data recorders from the wreckage and on Friday were struggling to extract the second one intact from a   camera on the front of the train, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported. The two recorders are expected to contain information on speed, braking and other conditions that will help experts piece together the operation of the equipment and the actions of the engineer immediately before the New Jersey Transit commuter train crashed. Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, the woman who died in the crash, was not a passenger on the train but was killed by falling debris. She was a    mother of one daughter described as having a â€œbig and genuine heart, â€œI am speechless and feel like the world stopped for some moments,â€ Cecilia Marques, a former   at a company that specialized in travel to Brazil, told the Associated Press. â€œI had the privilege to get to know and work with Fabiola for some years, and I can say she was a great, talentedâ€ woman. De Kroon previously worked in the Brazilian legal department of SAP, a technology firm, the company said in a statement. She had just dropped her toddler daughter off at daycare before rushing to catch a train, according to daycare director Karlos Magner. â€œWe had a good talk for like a minute,â€ he said. â€œShe said she was in a rush. â€ A bystander, Rahman Perkins, tried to help De Kroon but could only comfort her as she lay trapped by metal debris that had fallen from the partially collapsed ceiling. â€œI just told her to fight for your breath, think about your family, think about your friends, think about tomorrow,â€ Perkins said. â€œI just wanted her to feel special and just donâ€™t think about the pain, donâ€™t think about whatever this chaos is, donâ€™t worry about it, youâ€™ll be fine. â€ Perkins said he tried to hug the woman as she died. â€œI saw that beauty in her. I saw that peace,â€ he said. â€œI want [de Kroonâ€™s family] to know she was that same person, she wasnâ€™t mangled, she wasnâ€™t all over the place, she was just there and unfortunately she didnâ€™t make it. â€ Engineer Gallagher, a   veteran of New Jersey Transit, was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon. Fifteen of the injured were still in the hospital, including two in intensive care. Meanwhile, early on Friday morning commuters faced a confusing and dark journey into New York City. Reporters on the scene captured images of a lightless and signless transit hub, where commuters had to navigate an unfamiliar station to reach a ferry to New York. Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York avoided commenting on Thursday on whether positive train control, a safety device widely used in Europe and ordered by the federal government, could have prevented the crash. The speed limit heading into the station is 10mph. â€œThe train came in at much too high rate of speed, and the question is: why is that?â€ Christie said. More answers were expected from a National Transportation Safety Board investigation, including from event recorders recovered from the accident,   Bella   said on Friday morning.. The implementation of positive train control has been delayed in New York and New Jersey, despite repeated deadly crashes in the area, including in the Bronx and in Valhalla, New York, on a Metro North train and near Philadelphia on an Amtrak train.  The crash has also put a renewed focus on New Jersey Transit, an organization some critics say has been â€œsystematically starvedâ€ by Christieâ€™s cuts and a lack of state transportation funds. Despite   recent exceptions, rail continues to be one of the safest ways for passengers to travel in the US. Each year, roughly seven passengers on mainline trains are killed, according to recent research. Cuomo and Christie both cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the role that the lack of positive train control played or did not play in the tragedy. The NTSB has been pressing for some version of the technology for at least 40 years and the industry is under government orders to install it, but regulators have repeatedly extended the deadline at railroadsâ€™ request. The target date is now the end of 2018. Over the past 20 years, the NTSB has listed the lack of positive train control as a contributing factor in 25 crashes. Those include an Amtrak crash last year in Philadelphia in which a speeding train ran off the rails along a curve. Eight people were killed. In 2011, a Port Authority   or Path commuter train crash in a separate section of the Hoboken station injured more than 30 people. The NTSB found the engineer failed to control the speed of the train as it entered the station and investigators also determined a contributing factor was the absence of positive train control. â€œTheyâ€™ll have to answer for themselves, but at the end of the day if safety is job one   â€¦     then you have to have a better record than New Jersey Transit has right now,â€ said New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, noting that the transit agency said in a 2016 Federal Railroad Administration report that it did not have positive train control on any locomotive or segment of track. â€œThat means zero across the board,â€ he said. â€œThey need to do better than zero across the board. â€",537,533,,fake

Icihiro broke Pete Roseâ€™s   record of 4, 256 after a double during the Miami Marlinsâ€™ game against the San Diego Padres, but Rose said he wasnâ€™t counting Ichiroâ€™s hits in Japan. The Miami Marlins outfielder has a career total of 4, 257 hits  â€”   2, 979 in MLB and 1, 278 in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. Rose, who won three World Series rings, told USA Today earlier this week: â€œIt sounds like in Japan theyâ€™re trying to make me the Hit Queen. Iâ€™m not trying to take anything away from Ichiro  â€”   heâ€™s had a Hall of Fame career  â€”   but the next thing you know, theyâ€™ll be counting his high school hits. â€œI donâ€™t think youâ€™re going to find anybody with credibility say that Japanese baseball is equivalent to   baseball. There are too many guys that fail here, and then become household names there, like Tuffy Rhodes. How can he not do anything here, and hit (a  ) 55 home runs (in 2001) over there? â€œIt has something to do with the caliber of personnel. â€ Ichiroâ€™s pursuit of the milestone is big news in Japan. NHK, Japanâ€™s national public broadcasting network, is broadcasting every game to chronicle one of the greatest achievements in Japanese sports history. But in the US, itâ€™s drawn little fanfare  â€”   something that doesnâ€™t sit well with some. â€œI cannot believe itâ€™s not a bigger deal in Major League Baseball. Shame on us for not making a bigger deal out of it,â€ Arizona Diamondbacks assistant hitting coach Mark Grace told USA Today. â€œYouâ€™re talking about breaking Pete Roseâ€™s record. I couldnâ€™t care less if he got some of those hits in Japan or in Antarctica. Youâ€™re getting hits at high professional levels. Thatâ€™s huge. Iâ€™m in awe of the guy. â€ Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who produced 2, 153 career hits, said: â€œItâ€™s hard to compare, but itâ€™s a lot of hits no matter how you slice it. Weâ€™ve had a number of Japanese players come over and be really successful. To say itâ€™s   and   numbers, thatâ€™s not quite fair. â€œThe fact is that heâ€™s going to have 3, 000 hits here, and to have all of those hits in Japan, too, tells you how special he is. The hits over there are hits against good quality pitching, basically major   players, so theyâ€™re legitimate for sure. â€",504,878,"923126512458616832	923135295070990341	923189780476780544	923240820429467649	923280801088892930	923332129123119104	923380992349495296	923400663165366272	923409412361818112	923417965336260608	923449342777839616	923472672947949568	923500659709792256	923515461274349568	923528956669779970	923529622498828288	923530707946926081	923571269114777601	923583881793617920	923583987204857856	923591579511808000	923614584648368130	923662802597838848	923682686018846722	923716771621699584	923738095983431681	923764568165441537	923786002736603136	923786555524775938	923828050093015040	923879066536742912	923904432819097600	923916950622887937	923921914824921088	923934763739738112	923939323774492672	923943178348228613	923947586704330757	923961150848544775	923963128534122496	923972365373067264	923974280253263872	923974362801233920	923979101634838528	923983285189038086	923988603524362240	923992243068981248	924004879328309248	924015208934363137	924016551950503936	924025285519044609	924039801224826880	924068163825913858	924073852141015040	924108630521024513	924118284626219008	924133133972398080	924142347662880769	924145175835820033	924173612491460608	924174343889981440	924178079198609408	924180371243261953	924188419907112960	924206255899660288	924216731463180288	924218320735399936	924222678579458048	924225951306846209	924246985535905792	924273322946453504	924287379455774720	924287820658892800	924292595362226176	924296886978338816	924298399385612289	924307240294715394	924308297225732097	924309552547409922	924317786767204353	924317924059439105	924321042226495488	924325329040265217	924344602336821248	924346474103787520	924346473864712193	924356117290979330	924360272902524928	924367409691201538	924378569731489792	924381942405124096	924395966450372608	924418308622790656	924429421951504385	924439340016574464	924449823041966080	924450285359022080	924467242309505024	924469678587641857	924476667212341248	924496762160713729	924502906098745345	924514756433711104	924519320507551744	924520047741145088	924531596060909574	924555128866267136	924563370791133184	924619593838084096	924624893408436224	924625269142548480	924631027183706112	924641021388042240	924643555146006528	924648392843841538	924649986297434112	924651957956071424	924662475810676736	924666748560904193	924698196944842752	924712494203056128	924718048979947520	924742933412270080	924755567834517506	924756146216247296	924756367012958209	924759152248967173	924760207011532800	924768461385097216	924783447209541632	924797193499938817	924833205915500544	924834182714368000	924859641783205888	924863693287981057	924889382141620224	924923071210950656	924930223669370880	924945120847454208	924948959176429570	924950270077030400	924951566339248129	924953847491162114	924965986557497344	924975771902468097	925034221885952001	925061395384745985	925077765040242688	925085065503215617	925115333018570752	925185566831972352	925202719014469632	925222559846731776	925230126484164608	925260506457182209	925265207588524033	925282703401943040	925307081493762048	925309116159070208	925336989162881025	925358902094397441	925448841175994368	925452965086932992	925458536397668352	925459592619921409	925491820913717248	925491858494631936	925497702116360192	925516313707077633	925542724886962178	925551319129223168	925690992304541697	925698067336257537	925704527663075329	925724302791626754	925761203648987137	925777598222884865	925807650100592640	925868185773133825	925878213296906240	925939943590985728	926071653540548608	926425104547901442	926458409586638848	926465684896403456	926486767863320579	926523456035880960	926523545043263489	926569314207129600	926589767436914688	926671432863666176	926724814634672129	926753668526891009	926769963209297921	927246659213516800	931367479770836992	931367521202200576	931898358750482432	932406735783968768	934102646822133761	935942229310492675	1032042043676258304",fake

At the IOCâ€™s session before the Rio Olympic Games, the president intensified his attack on Wada, saying it was to blame for the chaos because it did not act sooner to investigate claims of Russian doping. Asked for a show of hands in support of the IOCâ€™s stance, 84 of the 85 members raised their hand. Only Britainâ€™s Adam Pengilly voted against Bachâ€™s position. More than 200 Russian athletes are in Rio in limbo having been put forward to compete by their federations but awaiting ratification by a   IOC panel at some point before the opening ceremony on Friday. Most of the sports put forward the majority of the Russian athletes who had been nominated, with only athletics, rowing, weightlifting and canoeing taking a more robust stance. on Wednesday the court of arbitration for sport threw out the appeal filed by 17 Russian rowers against their exclusion from the Games. The IOC has been roundly criticised for its confusing response to the McLaren report that was commissioned by Wada and which revealed systemic widespread doping in Russia across the majority of Olympic sports. Bach again blamed Wada for failing to act sooner on evidence of   doping in Russia and releasing its findings so close to the start of the Games. He said it would be wrong to make individual Russian athletes â€œcollateral damageâ€ for the wrongdoing of their government. â€œLeaving aside that such a comparison is completely out of any proportion when it comes to the rules of sport, let us just for a moment consider the consequences of a â€˜nuclear optionâ€™,â€ Bach said. â€œThe result is death and devastation. This is not what the Olympic movement stands for. The cynical â€˜collateral damageâ€™ approach is not what the Olympic movement stands for. What is therefore not acceptable is the insinuation by some proponents of this nuclear option, that anyone who does not share their opinion is not fighting against doping. â€ Bach has become increasingly emboldened in his stance since arriving in Rio, arguing in his opening press conference the IOCâ€™s reputation had not been damaged by the affair. Bach, whose links to Vladimir Putin have also come under scrutiny, went further in front of the IOC members as he renewed his attack on Wada. â€œIt is not the IOC that is responsible for the accreditation and supervision of   laboratories,â€ he said. â€œThe IOC has no authority over the testing programme of athletes outside the Olympic Games. The IOC has no authority to follow up on information about the failings of the testing system. â€ The IOC has convened a meeting later this year to discuss the future of   with the future of Wada  â€”     funded by the IOC and governments  â€”   in the balance. Many argue it would be a retrograde step to give the IOC more control over  . Sir Craig Reedie, who is an IOC   but also the president of Wada, admitted that the   system was partly broken but denied he had been â€œrun under a busâ€ by Bach and the IOC. â€œI would like to think not all the system is broken, that part of the system is broken, and we should start to identify those parts that need full attention,â€ he said. Earlier, the Argentinean IOC member Dr Gerardo Werthein had accused Wada of being â€œmore interested in   and publicityâ€. Reedie responded: â€œI told him that I found that personally offensive. He assured me that he wasnâ€™t speaking about me. â€ Reedie has repeatedly called in recent months for more money to fund   suggesting in an article for the Guardian that sponsors and rights holders should divert some of their cash into dramatically increasing its $27m a year budget, currently provided jointly by the IOC and national governments. â€œI have to find out the additional things people want me to do. I can tell you that we have a limited number of people employed around the world and every year, we are asked to do more and more and more with effectively the same level of funding,â€ said Reedie. â€œIâ€™ve been running the hare that perhaps broadcasters, sponsors that invest in and benefit very largely from the world of sport, might just think clean sport was a good idea and would like to help. â€ The strongest criticism came from the Canadian member Dick Pound, the founding Wada president who has been outspoken in calling for a complete ban on Russia and oversaw the original investigation that led to an outright ban of all but one Russian track and field athlete. â€œWe need to do a lot more to show we really do care about fair play, honest competition and clean athletes,â€ he said. By the end, however, Pound was among the 84 members who voted in favour. â€œThe arrowâ€™s left the bow,â€ he said. â€œThe decision has been made, itâ€™s not going to be changed between now and the start of the Games. â€ The world swimming governing body Fina moved to clarify the position of two swimmers, Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev, who were named in McLarenâ€™s report but have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport against their ban. â€œContrary to recent media reports, the eligibility of Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev to compete at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 has not been confirmed, and will not be confirmed until the IOCâ€™s   commission to review Russian entrants renders its final decision on these athletes, along with the other members of the Russian swimming team,â€ Fina said, â€œThe two athletes filled an appeal to Cas and Fina understands that this court has forwarded the case to the IOC   commission for final decision. â€ Cas is also due to rule on another Russian swimmer, Yuliya Yefimova, who appealed against the IOCâ€™s decision to ban all Russian athletes who had served a ban. That decision has been heavily criticised because athletes from other countries who have served a ban, such as Justin Gatlin, are eligible to compete.",576,962,"880455776107679747	880457763876462598	880461471016255489	880481721749094400	880494363876380674	880498653986672640	880498653571325952	880501912449171456	880501915456372736	880503671900880896	880505712551395328	880506686368133120	880506691955052544	880506696673538048	880506866161205248	880507317023678464	880507335889768448	880508713450192896	880508786636709888	880508795516071937	880508813903790080	880508822237982720	880508831528349696	880508841087164416	880508850029420544	880508868010418176	880508876742963200	880508884988948480	880508894132527105	880513616251936770	880513733562322944	880515239527161856	880515251443126272	880519280541876224	880521042527100928	880544521435611137	880545209381146625	880548735318491136	880549588515540992	880556739896233989	880560426626535425	880568632811696128	880598023310409728	880613424908075009	880637798885212160	880705340131745792	880722044853379072	880831143414726656	880840453855129600	880842088501448704	880900200109355009	880938214793531392	881124328426942464	881130104306499585	881136029016756224	881146466202419200	881147591412654080	881163829987557376	881171602494324737	881200570739998720	881209539189760002	881224884637937664	881244622470565888	881251943179587589	881261248540680192	881266893272657920	881273560815239168	881274599165509633	881275019342557190	881278376887152642	881279603519746049	881282989031911429	881283229734522880	881285492112728064	881285504586698752	881285691904282624	881288226304086016	881290615073513473	881296347974029313	881302489877762048	881303623715528705	881311078449160192	881322287785533441	881324672779812864	881330668202074112	881336574239289344	881337221453934592	881341234798882817	881345305429647360	881346719283372034	881349192890945536	881362617972908032	881371381262196736	881372760118878208	881374718699479040	881376681260462080	881392357366571008	881392473720868864	881395658808213505	881400767353020416	881409436019036162	881418049374629888	881428415638757376	881448363568369664	881467232911593472	881471514306109440	881487947308126209	881496134174343169	881509510489288704	881520388928401411	881521279735656449	881533985960210433	881541819422605313	881550369171615746	881550369159098368	881550369083580418	881560344967118848	881566246034124802	881576369544601600	881582244682276864	881596831410421761	881600198161686529	881628040719208448	881637946834604033	881660754776207361	881694521880453121	881703035918925824	881720200768479233	881735524414836736	881735524364550145	881735523458482176	881750627465912320	881753644189728768	881783458103787520	881846135375187968	881849801888980993	881866569520996352	881887572670259206	881925550436225024	881936239351541761	882132723439202304	882290193339891712	882343777913929729	882422113562378241	882565697200631809	882939832141455360	882980860659617792	883071639163998208	883283659993866240	883302337120522240	883326882426503174	883419668379258880	883490795550101504	883879346427047936	884600482118979584	884603666220462080	886009827033362432	886661331838959616	886677453158088705	886691618681651200	886937654625021952	887150285570715649	887227523406352385	889922545344008193	889998646833532929	890449359493582849	891713908456570880	892480519170076672	893458316705353729	894478222456475648	894655469238853632	894656109239205889	894658784387362816	894661151996481536	894687689013907457	894693299260280832	895859339457470464	897857030186074112	898535190129246208	898540294144184321	900033430460792832	902182554165436416	903635482034233345	903635762599657474	903636030229811201	903636618455777281	903636784525041665	903637142433345536	903637724351123457	903638782708211712	903640291982401538	903685552381321216	903696138628472835	903806777438990336	903858002301734912	904001950676533248	904070203394445312	904074167166930946	904113239197454336	905316172714852352	910371443904565248	911349745691578368	934057787138682880",fake

Put the tennis obituaries back in the file. Roger Federerâ€™s dream of a record eighth Wimbledon title is alive and well somehow after one of the most dramatic comebacks, even in his   career. Outgunned in the first two sets by the   Croat Marin Cilic, Federer pulled himself back from the dead, saving three   before squeezing out a   ( )       ( )   victory to secure a place in the   for the 11th time. It was a remarkable victory, his 10th from two sets down and one clinched with a 27th ace before celebrating with both arms thrust toward the sky. With his 35th birthday just around the corner and in a year in which he has been struck down with knee and back injuries, it may just go down as one of the most satisfying wins of his career. â€œWhen youâ€™re saving match points, when youâ€™re down two sets to love,     itâ€™s a moment when itâ€™s not in your control anymore,â€ said Federer, who now plays Canadaâ€™s No6 seed Milos Raonic, a         winner over the American Sam Querrey in Fridayâ€™s  . â€œBut I fought, I tried, I believed. At the end I got it done. So it was great on so many levels. This one is definitely huge because itâ€™s Centre Court at Wimbledon, and it still gives me the chance to win the tournament. â€ Federer is a confident beast rarely do we get the chance to see inside his psyche, any vulnerability kept well under wraps. But having missed the French Open with a back injury and having needed knee surgery in February, he arrived here lacking sharpness and miles in his legs. Four easy wins against significantly   opponents suggested he was playing well but even he has been surprised at his form. â€œI was very worried coming here,â€ he admitted. â€œI think it was huge for me to play the seven matches I did in Halle and Stuttgart. They served me very well. They gave me so much information to see what I could do, what I couldnâ€™t do, how I could play, how I couldnâ€™t play. â€œThen, knowing that I had a week in between, if I get through the first week here at Wimbledon   â€¦     I put myself in that position perfectly without dropping sets, which was a big surprise to me. Next thing, youâ€™re in the semis. Youâ€™re really deep into the tournament. I surprised myself in quite a big way actually. â€ Cilic beat Federer in the   at the US Open in 2014 on the way to his first grand slam title and for two sets it looked like he was about to do the same again. Though he was holding easily enough himself, Federer could not get a racket on the Cilic serve and the Croat played a superb   winning it   to take the first set and then one break, in the third game of the second, was enough to double his lead. The match turned on the seventh game of the third set, which was level at   when Federer escaped from   and then broke in the next game when Cilic  . The Swiss served out the set and though both missed break chances early in the fourth, Federer was hanging on. Cilic had three match points, the first at   the second at   and the third in the   only for Federer to come up with some clutch serving and when he took it   on his fifth set point, the worm had turned. Serving first in the deciding set, Federer had the edge and after missing a break point at   he finally broke for   and clinched victory with another ace out wide. Of his 27 aces, 15 came in the final two sets and Federer will now prepare to face Raonic, whom he beat at the same stage two years ago. Cilic was proud of his performance. â€œIt was a huge occasion and I played great tennis,â€ he said. â€œI was very close to the victory. Obviously itâ€™s not easy to deal with [the result]. â€œBut I have to take the positives and [think of] the great tennis that I managed to play. Itâ€™s the first time in my career I think that Iâ€™ve lost the match when I was two sets to love up but I havenâ€™t let myself down a little bit, physically or mentally. In all three sets [Federer won] I played pretty good tennis. â€œIf we would play again, I would try to be more aggressive on the chances when I had them in the fourth. Maybe there was a slight hesitation in some of them. The situation made it big. In those situations, I was not getting the best out of me. â€ As for Federer, who is now the oldest man since 1974 to make the Wimbledon   and draws level with Jimmy Connorsâ€™ open era best 11

The    who is gay, revealed he wanted to be a girl as he grew up and dressed exclusively as one when he was a child. He suggested that Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality and Olympian who was formerly Bruce Jenner, had made a mistake in undergoing gender transition and had â€œno clueâ€ what being transsexual involved. Everett, currently starring in the BBC1 show The Musketeers, told the Sunday Times magazine: â€œI really wanted to be a girl. Thank God the world of now wasnâ€™t then, because Iâ€™d be on hormones and Iâ€™d be a woman. After I was 15 I never wanted to be a woman again. â€  He believes parents who â€œget medicalâ€ are scary, saying: â€œItâ€™s nice to be allowed to express yourself, but the hormone thing, very young, is a big step. I think a lot of children have an ambivalence when theyâ€™re very young to what sex they are or what they feel about everyone. And there should be a way of embracing it. â€  He also spoke of how his former girlfriend Beatrice Dalle, the French actor, thought she might have been pregnant with his child. Everett told the magazine: â€œShe and I often talk about what would have happened if weâ€™d both had this child. And I would have loved to have had that child, actually. God, it probably would have been in rehab by now. â€  He also revealed that he was â€œturning into his motherâ€ and planned to move back in with her in Norfolk. â€¢ This article was amended on 20 June 2016. The Press Association misquoted Everett as telling the Sunday Times he opposed gender reassignment operations for children. In fact, Everett expressed reservations about hormone therapy.

The report was released by the National Guestworker Alliance (NGA) and is based on previous findings as well as interviews with 126 seafood processing workers in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and a range of   case studies. In order to succeed in a highly competitive global market, US seafood processors have increasingly come to rely on temporary labor. Such workers include   visa laborers as well as undocumented workers. Their immigration status makes these workers vulnerable to exploitation. The NGA found that these workers were unlikely to report abuse on the job due to threats from employers not to hire them in subsequent seasons and sponsor them for   visa. Undocumented workers have been threatened with immigration enforcement. â€œThis new research exposes a reality that workers know all too well,â€ said Daniel Castellanos, former   guest worker and a   of the NGA. â€œSeafood processing workers are routinely subjected to severe forms of exploitation by companies producing cheap seafood for major retailers and food distributors like Walmart. And when they speak out or try to resist abuse, they are punished severely for it. â€ A Walmart spokeswoman told the Guardian that the company cares about the men and women in its supply chain.  â€œWalmartâ€™s standards for suppliers lists our social and environmental expectations for our suppliers, specifically addressing working conditions, voluntary labor, pay, the cultivation of a safe and healthy work environment, and freedom of association,â€ she said. â€œWalmart also is committed to participating in collaborative efforts with external stakeholders to advance the goal of identifying risk and building a more transparent supply chain, including participation in industry groups that serve as a vehicle to share experiences and gain new information that can help improve operations and the global supply chains as a whole. â€ Among the indicators of forced labor detected by NGA in the US supply chain were verbal abuse, curfews, threats of denunciation to immigration authorities and poor treatment by supervisors. Those workers surveyed also reported having their wages stolen, not being paid overtime, and being paid less than originally promised. According to the report, a majority of workers processing scallops and groundfish in the large plants in New Bedford were hired on a temporary basis. The NGA also referenced a 2009 report that found nearly 75% of seafood processing workers in the city â€œwere undocumented migrants, generally hired through temp agenciesâ€. In Louisiana, seafood employers rely heavily on   visa workers. According to the NGA, utilization of   visas among seafood employers tripled between 1990 and 2000. â€œIn the 1970s, when I started my business, I was lucky enough to have the refugees from Vietnam come in, so we brought in roughly 40 of them to help us through that time,â€ Frank Randol, president of   crawfish processor Randol Inc told Congress last year. â€œOver the course of the years, we came to the 1990s when that started to wane just a little bit, we discovered the   program and started bringing in the guestworkers from Mexico. â€  Randol described the jobs at his processing plant as â€œone of Americaâ€™s least desired jobsâ€ and said that union activity has made it difficult for him to hire workers.  The NGA report was released at the end of the International Labour Conference, which is currently being held in Geneva. The NGA has called on the International Labour Organization (ILO) to â€œmove towards a binding legal convention regulating global value chainsâ€. The alliance also asked the ILO to organize a conference to explore the adverse impact of contracting and purchasing practices on migrant workersâ€™ rights, and to assemble research on how purchasing practices of multinational corporations affect core labor standards and the wages and benefits of workers. â€œEven on the end of seafood supply chains in the US, competition from   producers in Asia and elsewhere has created a powerful incentive for US processors to cut labor costs through wage theft, unsafe working conditions and at times forced labor conditions,â€ said JJ Rosenbaum, the NGAâ€™s legal adviser. â€œAs the report shows, the ILOâ€™s role ensuring decent work including living wages and the right to organize for all supply chain workers is fundamental to reverse the race to the bottom and support workers and their organizations in raising standards. â€",405,638,,fake

Last week, it was reported and then denied that his music was to be put up for sale. Now, we have news that it is to begin seeing the light of day. Donâ€™t get too excited, though, because thereâ€™s not going to be a great rush of songs. The big news for fans is that his 1984 album Purple Rain is to be reissued in a deluxe, remastered version, featuring a second disc of previously unreleased material. What that material might be is unknown, as is the release date. All that is known is that the record will emerge in early 2017, and will be based on plans agreed with Prince before his death in April. The Purple Rain reissue will be preceded by a new a new   compilation, Prince 4Ever, to be released next month. While that album is almost entirely greatest hits, thereâ€™s one treat for fans (or a shameless attempt to get them to shell out for music they already have, depending on your point of view) in the form of Moonbeam Levels, a previously unreleased track. Previously unreleased does not, in this case, mean previously unheard. The track is a   favourite among Prince fans, well enough known to have been covered in concert by Elvis Costello. You can find it on YouTube if you want to. It was recorded in July 1982, and included as the final track on the aborted album Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic  â€”   not the different Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic  â€”   before being shelved for Prince to work on the Batman soundtrack album.",456,595,"888028346742964224	888130872934780928	888190070825652229	888307559240564736	888452606833549312	889834755025498112	891031829293223941	891508621506363392	901836507631071232	901931327431340032",fake
politifact14233,jis.gov.jm/president-trump-underscores-us-jamaica-relations/,President Trump Underscores US-Jamaica Relations,"Donald Trump has made the most direct appeal of his campaign to African American voters as he battles to offset dismal polling among black voters and draw political capital from a recent spate of racially charged unrest in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Riots broke out in Milwaukeeâ€™s Sherman Park area on Saturday after the fatal police shooting of black    Sylville Smith, who police said pointed a firearm at an officer after fleeing a traffic stop. The overwhelmingly black neighborhood remained on edge after the city imposed a night curfew, fearing further unrest after arrests and gunfire on Sunday evening. Speaking at a rally on Tuesday night in the rural town of West Bend, 30 miles from Milwaukee, Trump, who has branded himself the â€œlaw and order candidateâ€ told an almost exclusively white audience that the rioting was â€œan assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and to live in peaceâ€  â€”   and said black people were the biggest victims of violence in their neighborhoods. â€œLaw and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities,â€ Trump said. â€œThe main victims of these riots are   African American citizens living in these neighborhoods. Itâ€™s their job, itâ€™s their homes, itâ€™s their schools and communities which will suffer the most as a result. â€ Trump said he was asking for â€œthe vote of every African American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different futureâ€. â€œIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths,â€ he said. â€œThe Democratic party has failed and betrayed the African American community. â€  Recent analysis has indicated that Trump is polling at around 2% with the African American electorate  â€”   worse than almost every Republican candidate since 1948  â€”   and is even behind the Green party nominee, Jill Stein, and libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, placing him fourth overall among black voters.  Party insiders have begun urging their nominee to increase his outreach in African American communities nationwide. He has done little to court the demographic, most recently rejecting invitations to speak at the annual conventions of the NAACP and the National Association of Black Journalists. Trumpâ€™s rally on Tuesday evening had been scheduled before unrest broke out in Milwaukee but he seized on the opportunity to accuse his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of being â€œagainst the policeâ€ and suggested she and other Democrats were directly responsible for rioting in the city and others around America. â€œThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  â€”   a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  â€”   share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country,â€ Trump said in a speech that was delivered using a teleprompter. The billionaire accused Clinton of preferring to â€œprotect the offender [rather] than the victimâ€ suggested that â€œa vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunitiesâ€. He argued that African Americans had been â€œhurt worstâ€ by Clintonâ€™s immigration policy. Trump reiterated claims first made during his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention in July, suggesting that â€œlaw and order must be restoredâ€ amid rising homicide rates in Americaâ€™s largest 50 cities. Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime has in fact declined to historic lows under the Obama administration. The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing â€œthe bestâ€ prosecutors and judges and pursuing â€œstrong enforcementâ€ of federal laws. This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, according to recent polling while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americansâ€™ support for police was at a   low and especially weakened among the African American population. Trumpâ€™s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of Americaâ€™s   history, was on sale outside of the rally. The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a   radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of Americaâ€™s most racially segregated metropolitan areas. â€œThatâ€™s the way they (black people) are in that city,â€ said Ken Schladweiler, a    from the small rural town of Neosho. â€œAll of that (unrest connected to Smithâ€™s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. Theyâ€™re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. Thatâ€™s just the way they are. â€ His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: â€œAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: donâ€™t they (black people) have work? Theyâ€™re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Donâ€™t they have work?â€ Julie Wanie, a    healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didnâ€™t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all. â€œI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows thatâ€™s a certain area you stay out of. â€ Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: â€œI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars. â€ In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released. â€œ  â€¦     The gun was pointed at his (a police officerâ€™s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? Thatâ€™s what the narrative is,â€ Trump said. â€œMaybe itâ€™s not true. If it is true, people shouldnâ€™t be rioting. â€ While Trumpâ€™s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists. Just hours before Trumpâ€™s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a   statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime. â€œNow more than ever itâ€™s important to have   conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trumpâ€™s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,â€ Serpas said.",45,924,8.77E+17,fake

You might not expect to find many Trump supporters at an allegedly liberal college, but the Republican nomineeâ€™s reach is extensive, despite his litany of offensive comments towards women, ethnic minorities and his various political opponents. â€œThose are part of the things I donâ€™t agree with,â€ Hover said, when asked if he too, feels that Mexico is sending rapists to the US, and if he agrees with Trumpâ€™s treatment of women. â€œI do feel that gender equality and racial equality are more towards the top of what I like to see brought out in a presidential campaign,â€ Hover said. The    did not find too many issues with Trumpâ€™s other remarks on the trail. A recent poll showed Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by  % among those under 35. This year millennials (broadly speaking, people born between 1981 and 1997) overtook the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) as the largest generation in the US. Shanon Thomas, a    womenâ€™s studies and criminology major, is among those planning to vote for Clinton. Thomas said she wanted to hear the former New York senator address inequality during the debate. â€œShe will do a good job in bringing equality to this country,â€ Thomas said. â€œThatâ€™s the only way we can get ourselves back to being great  â€”   as opposed to what other candidates think make America great. â€ She was referencing the baseball hats that Trump has been wearing and selling as part of his campaign. Trumpâ€™s other business ventures have included a board game, vodka and meat.  An    political science major called Doreen, who asked that her last name not be published, said the candidates should focus on racial issues. â€œI think definitely things regarding police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement, that definitely is something that needs to be talked about,â€ she said. Doreen, who is African American, referenced the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. â€œI feel scared,â€ she said.  â€œWatching the video of what happened in Tulsa itâ€™s kind of like that could have been anybody.  â€œThat couldâ€™ve been my dad, that could have been anyone in the world that I know. â€",435,567,"928256554499035136	928423823455784960	929534016323309568	929808688230973440	931210334408531975	932274510207901697	933860430400892928	935405176021749760	947968109935251456	948317508578226176	956024516072886272	957310806957395968	963683823551688706	1019695741009387520	1019696201925619714	1019883580766457856	1019905973882904577	1019923280168448001	1019934030886768641	1019935141651656706	1019941756924723206	1019942376633262080	1019947618951204868	1019952478798991362	1019958373393969153	1019967260709085184	1019989341874114561	1020007281910575110	1020037615582662656	1020057309886730241	1020089539501744135	1020101016308658176	1020103815708717061	1020280988159565825	1020364855285465088	1020491893875118080	1020495811011018752	1020522238951424000	1020631859494080512	1020874488857202688	1021429994780856320	1024063823433687041	1024286758975012864	1025730640300265472	1028378566940139520	1028651121395617792	1032273641839513601	1050963625077174272",fake

Surely not. .. That entertainment enchanter JK Rowling has come storming back to the world of magic in a shower of supernatural sparks   and created a glorious   adventure, all about the wizards of   America and the diffident wizarding Brit who causes chaos in their midst with a bagful of exotic creatures. Itâ€™s a lovely performance from Eddie Redmayne who is a pretty fantastic beast himself. Thereâ€™s a moment when he has to â€œwhisperâ€ an errant animal into submission and his contortions would put Andy Serkis to shame. His Newt is a connoisseur, scientist and scatterbrained   taxonomist who is not far from the   Dr Who, a specless Potter or beardless Darwin. Redmayneâ€™s distinctively breathy voice even has something of the young Attenborough. With the openness and likability of his screen presence, and the sheer generosity of   energy, he and the cast are giving us an early Christmas treat.  Potter veteran David Yates directs and Rowling has adapted the Hogwarts textbook Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, by one Newt Scamander: the first name is short for â€œNewtonâ€ and nothing to do with the witchâ€™s ingredient. This was a fictional work of magical scholarship first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone and which Rowling herself wrote out and published in aid of Comic Relief a couple of years later. So who was Scamander? Rowling gives us the answer by converting this static encyclopaedia into a spectacular   about the origins of his book, set in New York City of the prewar era, 70 or 80 years before Philosopherâ€™s Stone. Does that make it a prequel? Sort of. There are a few hints and allusions, including a namecheck for Dumbledore. It promises to be the first of a series and it wouldnâ€™t surprise me to learn that Rowling already has every detail sorted out for the entire saga in architectural detail  â€”   and that she got it straight in her mind before writing the first Potter.  Fantastic Beasts is a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment with some breathtaking digital fabrications of prewar New York City. This is Steampunk 2. 0, taking its inspirations from Terry Gilliamâ€™s Brazil or Howard Hawksâ€™s His Girl Friday but the New York she creates also has the dark, traumatised look of Gotham City. The American wizards themselves are subject to an internal debate about their attitude to the civilians in America a muggle is known as a â€œ â€. Itâ€™s a schism that threatens to reach   proportions.  The donnish and unworldly Newt arrives in New York on the hunt for some rare species, and just so happens to be carrying quite a few exotic specimens himself in his battered suitcase with its worryingly insecure clasps. But the city in which he has just arrived has been threatened by some kind of dark   of dark magic, smashing its way through streets and buildings, which is called an obscurial.  Daft Newt causes calamity almost immediately on arriving by creating a rumpus in a bank with his animals  â€”   and a quirk of fate means he forms the unlikeliest of friendships with a   Jacob Kowlaski (a beguiling performance from Dan Fogler) an   stuck in a factory job but nursing big dreams about opening his own bakery. But Newt, our   gentleman amateur from across the pond, exasperates the US wizard authorities and in particular their tough operative Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who herself has issues with her superiors. Tina finds herself having to protect Newt and Jacob and brings our two amigos back to the apartment she shares with her telepathic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) who gets the hots for Jacob. And might there also be a spark between Newt and Tina? Meanwhile, creepy   activist Mary Lou (Samantha Morton) and her adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) appear to have a disquieting connection with top   Percival Graves (Colin Farrell). Itâ€™s a very Rowling universe, dense with fun, but always taking its own jeopardy very seriously and effortlessly making you do the same. The Beasts movies may actually make clearer Rowlingâ€™s   debt to Roald Dahl. They also show that her universe with its exotic fauna is in the best way, a cousin to that of George Lucas.  There is a strange pleasure of seeing how her magic itself is as potent as ever. The muggle or   world we are seeing is nearly a century old, but the basic language and furniture and procedure of magic is not in any way older or rudimentary. It is the same thing. They have moving pictures on newspapers in the same way as the present day. As ever, magic is a state within a state, a secret in plain sight, and part of the fun is being let in on the secret.  Katherine Waterston is great as Tina and perhaps gives the Rowling universe what it never quite had until now: a really strong young female lead who could tackle the bad guys on equal terms with the man   as well as having the chops for romance.  Rowling and Yates have given us a terrifically   unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film. Thereâ€™s a scene in a speakeasy where someone orders â€œsix shots of  . â€ This film felt to me like twelve.

politifact14776,http://yournewswire.com/pope-francis-jesus-metaphorical/,"Pope Francis At Mass: ‘Jesus Is Metaphorical, Not Literal’","A US government request to trawl through the personal data of millions of users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase signals the start of an effort to pull digital currencies like bitcoin into the mainstream, experts have said. The â€œJohn Doeâ€ summons, a broad order for data on all Coinbase users in 2013, 2014 and 2015, was filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a federal court in California on 17 November. In the summons, the IRS said that all of Coinbaseâ€™s users in that period â€œhave not been or may not be complying with US internal revenue lawsâ€. Coinbase has said it will fight the request in court. Cryptocurrencies  â€”   digital assets which exist entirely online but are exchangeable for goods or services  â€”   have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because they grant a degree of user anonymity. Coinbase is the largest bitcoin exchange and its   brand. But user confidentiality has also caused headaches for governments, who worry the currencies are being used for drug dealing, money laundering or tax evasion. Digital currencies are currently taxed as an asset like gold, with capital gains tax due when there is an appreciation in value. However, the extent to which bitcoin users with US tax liabilities have been declaring such assets is unclear.  In documentation supporting its petition, the IRS referred to three anonymous cases of taxpayers who had used virtual currencies to evade tax, two of which were â€œcorporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollarsâ€ which used Coinbase wallets and concealed bitcoin transactions as â€œtechnology expensesâ€ on their tax returns. Several experts in cryptocurrency said that the IRS was on a â€œfishing expeditionâ€ and pointed out that it followed an excoriating report by the US treasuryâ€™s   for taxation which said the IRS was not doing enough to regulate and investigate cryptocurrencies. â€œThe government has no idea that anybody has committed a crime,â€ said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a lobbying and research group focused on cryptocurrencies. In a statement, Coinbase said: â€œAlthough Coinbaseâ€™s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the governmentâ€™s request. â€ It added: â€œIn its current form, we will oppose the governmentâ€™s petition in court. â€ Some experts, though dismayed by what they saw as the overly broad and invasive nature of the request, said that more government scrutiny on cryptocurrencies was inevitable as they became more mainstream.  â€œItâ€™s an indication of bitcoinâ€™s growing adoption,â€ said Chris Burniske, an analyst at ARK Investment Management who focuses on bitcoin. â€œAs more people use it, it is going to grow in a way which affects national and global economies, so the IRS needs more clarity on how citizens are using it,â€ he said. â€œGlobally, weâ€™re seeing regulators grapple with how to regulate and tax [cryptocurrencies]. â€  Others said that while they felt Coinbase was right to seek to narrow the scope of the request, some change was needed to bring bitcoin and its ilk out of the dark and into the world of mainstream finance.  â€œIf bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be viewed as legitimate financial instruments, there has to be some regulatory apparatus here,â€ said Kevin McIntyre, associate professor of economics at McDaniel College in Maryland. â€œCertainly,â€ he added, â€œthe tinfoil   libertarian types who embrace the privacy of [bitcoin] are going to be very disappointed. â€ Not all of them, however. Juan Llanos, an advisor in financial technology regulation and compliance, said he was seeing a lot of anger within the cryptocurrency industry at the IRSâ€™s move, but also some schadenfreude from the more anarchistic parts of bitcoinâ€™s user base.  â€œCoinbase has been attacked by   from the beginning, because they are the closest to a digital bank there is,â€ he said. â€œMany anarchists  â€”   usually the early adopters of bitcoin  â€”   who are against the customs of Coinbase are celebrating,â€ he said. This is not the first time the IRS has used blanket John Doe summonses as part of an investigation, though it is possible that the Coinbase request will be the largest of its kind. In 2014, a federal judge approved similar summonses for FedEx, DHL and UPS to produce information about taxpayers who use an offshore   service called Sovereign Management  Legal, and in 2015 a judge approved another summons for US taxpayers with offshore accounts at Belize Bank International Limited.",983,867,"931969801983004672	931983837558661120	931994268478013441	931994386505670656	931999894428057602	932013404788633600	932063050215165952	932071339955015680	932072935048826880	932087109703397376	932089247087161344	932101069047566336	932103725644177408	932117865343455232	932147432397393920	932213685078183937	932351685535715329	932356456699097090	932393084599656450	932398906943639552	932426081738678272	932430680046235648	932443919333261313	932451753794195456	932452566042009600	932459501780914176	932494440392024065	932571557960060929	932615795967893504	932631440830984193	932634563033092096	932654792928911362	932655325760688129	932660793648275457	932668890387238912	932679271562317824	932682305495289862	932697338937860096	932715240973897728	932723270041948160	932767885545562112	932806660623515648	932809208323563520	932822990458306560	932837455148941312	932856426351022080	932856465479659524	932860019745230848	932919561200046081	932936587356397568	932966965118996480	932971878926487552	932976639692148736	933004508774391808	933011915676188672	933069933931651074	933109159905693697	933139456617480193	933205723768598528	933236771827081216	933328532889063426	933358187985678336	933438906229342208	933501937638453248	933696144554704897	933915090579050496	934049297779384325	934229952660164609	934238766587371525	934397681572745216	934460513446256641	934487438709358592	935170693829931008	935237521302310914	935382178233401344	935604355465703424	935604893066424320	935605081399070720	935605125065912321	935605275414945793	935605485457178625	935605492730048513	935605505631727616	935605773048172544	935606069644152833	935606257536454661	935607064415653889	935608513732272129	935613290599682048	935620834449903617	935621426907926529	935736615921766402	935796871792017408	937238011778969600	937483729278242821	938107221715636224	938326276129153026	938902323719475201	939708578037891074	940005222809825280	940275439670571008	940660328068771840	940662336444157953	940721629172088832	942246993098952704	944780548198813699	945075656106311681	946358124335845376	946359449358426112	946364610831114240	946365119021436929	946380224815620096	946380465958682625	946382729612005376	946383235961049088	946383740183433217	946384746493464576	946385256604667905	946387641402044416	946388200125288453	946396404154535936	946397326200930306	946399345347317760	946410958464999424	955373874127847424	956777636516175873	961365431054368768	981714630916657152	1002633153083727873",fake

During a weekend of protests over killings by police, more than 160 people were arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where demonstrations continued to grow over the fatal shooting by officers last week of Alton Sterling, a    African American, as he was pinned down during a struggle.   vehicles, teargas and smoke grenades returned to American streets for the first time this summer, and Barack Obama appealed for calm and said those who attack law enforcement undermine the cause of social justice. The unrest built as authorities in Dallas said Micah Johnson, who opened fire on officers late last Thursday, had been plotting a wider bombing campaign that could have had â€œdevastating effectsâ€. Johnson was said to have been seeking revenge for the policeâ€™s treatment of African Americans.  Among the protesters arrested was DeRay Mckesson, a   national leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said Mckesson was arrested for blocking a street even as video he was livestreaming at the time of his detention indicated that he was off the roadway. He was released from custody late Sunday with a charge of â€œsimple obstruction of a highway of commerceâ€. Protesters complained they were being denied their rights to peaceful assembly. â€œIn cities across America, police are responding to peaceful protests with provocation, violence, and unconstitutional arrests,â€ said Samuel Sinyangwe, a prominent activist with the group Campaign Zero and a close ally of Mckessonâ€™s. Another 100 people were arrested during clashes with police in and around St Paul, Minnesota, where the death of Philando Castile after his shooting by a police officer last week was broadcast live on Facebook, causing widespread public anger. As protesters blocked an interstate highway, police flooded streets in Bearcat military vehicles and used smoke bombs to break up demonstrations. The police chief, Todd Axtell, said about 20 of his officers had been struck with bottles, rocks and other items pelted at them by crowds, which he said was â€œa disgraceâ€. Dozens more protesters were detained by police during protests in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore and Phoenix, where police used teargas and pepper spray to disperse crowds. More protests were planned for late on Sunday, including in St Louis, Missouri, where in August 2014 an unarmed black    was killed in the suburb of Ferguson in a flashpoint that continues to reverberate two years later. Tensions have risen even as the city of Dallas mourns the   killings of five police officers last week by Johnson, a    army veteran and member of the New Black Panther party. On Sunday, the Dallas police chief, David Brown, said investigators had found   equipment and written evidence indicating that Johnson was plotting attacks â€œlarge enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our north Texas areaâ€. â€œWeâ€™re convinced that this suspect had other plans, and thought what he was doing was righteous,â€ he added. Brown said Johnson had apparently been planning to â€œtarget law enforcement, and make us pay for what he sees as law enforcementâ€™s efforts to punish people of colourâ€ since before last weekâ€™s fatal shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, which merely triggered his actions. The police chief disclosed that Johnson had daubed the letters â€œRBâ€ in his own blood on a wall of the parking garage where he was cornered and eventually killed by a police robot. The significance of the initials were unclear. Investigators have also learned that Johnson had practiced   drills in his backyard and trained at a private   school that teaches special tactics, including â€œshooting on the moveâ€ a technique in which an attacker fires and quickly changes position, to keep his location uncertain and create the impression of multiple assailants. The deaths of Sterling and Castile had had apparently moved Johnson to act before his more ambitious plan could be realised, Brown said. The gunman had kept a journal of combat tactics, Brown said, but his writings included â€œquite a bit of rambling in the journal thatâ€™s hard to decipherâ€.  The police chief also revealed details of the   standoff between the gunman and police, which ended when officers sent a robot carrying a pound of C4 explosive to detonate near Johnson. The gunman, hidden in a brick corner where snipers could not see him and officers could not safely approach, demanded to speak only with a black police negotiator, Brown said. â€œHe lied to us, laughing, playing games, singing, asking how many did he get and saying he wanted to kill some more,â€ he said. The police chief eventually made the decision to improvise with the robot. â€œI began to feel he was going to charge us and take out many more before we would kill him,â€ Brown said, adding: â€œI approved [the decision] and Iâ€™d do it again under the same circumstances. â€ Obama cut short a visit to Europe early this week and will travel to Dallas before convening a summit at the White House between police chiefs and community leaders. Speaking Spain on Sunday, he defended the â€œmessy and controversialâ€ tradition of American protest but reiterated his condemnation of violence against law enforcement. â€œWhenever those of us who are concerned about failure of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause,â€ Obama said. Also on Sunday, Dallasâ€™s mayor, Mike Rawlings, said marchers carrying weapons and dressed in body armor had distracted law enforcement from the actual gunman on Thursday, telling CBSâ€™s Face the Nation that other individuals carrying guns on the scene â€œtook our eye off the ball for a momentâ€. â€œYou can carry a rifle legally and when you have gunfire going on, you usually go with the person thatâ€™s got a gun,â€ he said. â€œAnd so our police grabbed some of those individuals, took them to police headquarters and worked it out and figured out that they were not the shooters. But that is one of the real issues with the gun rights issues that we face  â€”   that in the middle of a firefight, itâ€™s hard to pick out the good guys and the bad guys. â€ He added that investigators were talking to Johnsonâ€™s neighbors and family to learn whether â€œthereâ€™s anybody that aided and abetted him, conspired with him. We donâ€™t have any new news on that regard.

politifact14664,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/17/ice-detainer-issued-for-suspected-wine-country-arsonist-in-sonoma-jail/,ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail,"As if the routine vulgarities of Donald Trump havenâ€™t made politics depressing enough, the New York state assembly is now on its second year of debating whether or not to rename State Route 107 in Oyster Bay, Long Island, â€œBilly Joel Boulevardâ€ in honor of the Piano Man himself. While fellow   Bob Dylan is basking in the glory of a Nobel Prize for literature, Billy Joel canâ€™t even get the state of New York to write his name on a street sign. Someone should write a song about that. The crux of the argument over the renaming is that Joel is not yet deceased, making the honor premature. People who get streets and roads named after them and statues erected in their likeness tend to be two things: male, as this New Yorker article points out, and dead. Billy Joel is definitely a man, as you would know if youâ€™ve heard the song Big Shot, but unfortunately for his bid for getting a patch of asphalt named after him, heâ€™s still ticking. Never in my gravest nightmares did I imagine that Christie Brinkleyâ€™s   could be a wedge issue in an election involving human adults in the year 2016. This could only be dumber if the debate was over whether or not to name an abandoned subway tunnel after Rick Springfield. â€œMy opponent is either impotent or is simply not trying, because everyone loves Billy Joel,â€ Democratic assembly candidate Dean Hart said about incumbent Republican Michael Montesano in a press release issued on Thursday. Yes, he issued a press release. The world must know! Michael Montesano doesnâ€™t care about classic rock!  â€œNext to Teddy Roosevelt, Long Island really doesnâ€™t have a more famous or popular person than Billy Joel,â€ Hart continues. Bit of a gulf in significance there. We go from a former president of the United States to the man famous for writing Scenes from an Italian Restaurant. Excuse me, but Long Island also gave us guitarist Joe Satriani, Amy Fisher, Stuttering John Melendez from the Howard Stern Show, and former NFL quarterback Vinnie Testaverde. Iâ€™d mention Thomas Pynchon, but Iâ€™ve clearly already proved my point. Nevertheless, hasnâ€™t Billy Joel done enough, his supporters ask? The residents of suburban New York donâ€™t even bother hiring a DJ for their weddings any more. They just play The Nylon Curtain on repeat and no one complains. But more importantly, shouldnâ€™t Billy Joel get to see Billy Joel Boulevard before he departs this earth? I might not be much of a fan of his, but as a fellow human, I can sympathize with those who want to recognize him while heâ€™s still around. Consider the funeral. Your loved ones dress you up in expensive clothes, toss you in a box lined with silk or velvet, then eat a bunch of cheese and drink a few glasses of wine at midday. They say wonderful things about you, pray that youâ€™ve gone to a bespoke afterlife that caters to your every whim, and, most importantly, remark on how good you look. â€œThey did a great job cleaning Dave up,â€ theyâ€™ll say as they gawp at my eerily beatific, rotting corpse. I donâ€™t get to see any of that  â€”   Iâ€™m dead! No wine, no cheese, no silk prison box, and no fancy suit. All the best parts of being dead are lost on the corpse. Why deny Billy Joel the right to see his name slapped on a green road sign before he travels â€œuptownâ€ for real. These sorts of honors really only serve one purpose, and thatâ€™s to lend the honoree a semblance of immortality. Your body might quit working, but there will always be that road for kids to ask their exasperated parents, â€œwhoâ€™s Billy Joel?â€ The more roads, bridges, burn units, sports arenas, museums and vape shops with our names on them, the greater chance we have of not fading into obscurity. At least, thatâ€™s the theory. Nevermind that Billy Joel is already the guy who sang Only the Good Die Young (thatâ€™s a bit of a laugh now, eh? ).  Granted, youâ€™ll still very much not alive, no matter how many places someone has scribbled your name. Also, State Route 107 might be ripped up and replaced with a tube system for   cars in the next 50 years. For now, at least, Billy Joel should be able to drive over a stretch of road bearing his name. Itâ€™s as close as any of us get to enjoying our inevitable demise.

politifact15178,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/09/trump-presidents-carter-bush-clinton-238125,Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America,"Chess has dropped almost completely from the public eye in the four decades since Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky waged their Cold War proxy battle in Reykjavik. This monthâ€™s world chess championship match in New York City will do little to reverse that course despite the organizersâ€™ best intentions, but early returns suggest the taut showdown between champion Magnus Carlsen and challenger Sergey Karjakin may not be as straightforward as initially suspected. It marks the first time New York has played host to a world title match since 1995, when Garry Kasparov retained his title against Viswanathan Anand on the   observatory deck in the south tower of the World Trade Center. For the past week Carlsen and Karjakin have faced off in a   studio within a sleek   arena on the third floor of the Fulton Market Building, only four blocks east from where the towers once stood. A   mirror allows spectators to watch the players in action, by themselves save for two silent arbiters, lending a   feel to the spectacle. Prices range from $75 for general admission to $1, 200 for VIP lounge access, where   can suck down vodka cocktails and rub elbows with grandmasters, financiers and the odd celebrity. Woody Harrelson, an avid player himself, spent most of the first two days taking challenges from   on the outdoor balcony overlooking the East River while Carlsen and Karjakin faced off inside. The     match began on Friday, with each contestant awarded one point for a win and a   for a draw. So far Carlsen and Karjakin have drawn all four games theyâ€™ve played and enter Thursdayâ€™s fifth meeting deadlocked at  . Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion, earning the winnerâ€™s share of a roughly $1. 1m prize fund. Carlsen, who is 25, was already regarded as the worldâ€™s best player even before he saw off Anand for the championship in Chennai three years ago and is the closest thing to a star in the sport today. Heâ€™s done ads for Porsche, modeled for   Raw alongside Liv Tyler and Lily Cole and enjoys a massive presence in his native Norway, where NRK is broadcasting the games in prime time. He is handsome and media trained, perhaps overly so, giving off the air of an unthreatening playboy. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history, a point frequently cited by those who have called him the greatest player ever. Karjakin, 26, earned the right to challenge for the title in March by making it through the Candidates Tournament in Moscow, where he defeated a series of   opponents, among them Brooklynâ€™s Fabiano Caruana. He was born in Ukraine, where he became an international grandmaster at 12 years old (a record that still stands) but adopted Russian citizenship in 2009. He is married with a son, an avowed supporter of Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Crimea, and speaks with a stutter that surfaces more in English than his native tongue. He is ranked ninth in the world. Karjakin is a player in the classical mold known for his resilience. Carlsen is known for his adaptability, which enables a flair for the unpredictable not commonly seen among top players. â€œ[Carlsen] has practically no weaknesses,â€ the Russian said at last weekâ€™s   press conference before more than one hundred credentialed media.  Any expectations of the political intrigue and paranoia associated with the sportâ€™s golden age were not disappointed. Israel Gelfer, the vice president of the world chess federation, spoke on behalf of the governing body only because Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was barred from entering the country due to his ties to the Syrian government and the Central Bank of Syria. At one point Carlsen fielded a question over the rumors that heâ€™d enlisted Microsoft for cybersecurity consultation over concerns Karjakinâ€™s team were trying to hack his preparations. No fewer than two questions were posed about   never mind that Carlsen and Karjakin were years away from being born when the Match of the Century took place. This time around in New York, the chess eventually went off, no doubt to the organizersâ€™ relief, and it didnâ€™t take long for the first surprise. Carlsen, handling the white pieces, played the   Trompowsky Attack in Fridayâ€™s first game, a   opening heâ€™d later confess was at least partially inspired by the name of Americaâ€™s newly minted  . The Norwegian played fast and it seemed like heâ€™d outprepared his rival, but Karjakin managed to scratch back to force a mostly forgettable draw after 42 moves. Karjakin played the far more familiar Ruy Lopez in Saturdayâ€™s second game, prompting a Morphy Defense from Carlsen. That also ended in a draw, this time on the 33rd move. After Sundayâ€™s rest day the players reconvened for Game 3, a   of a contest that saw Karjakin recover from a misstep on his 30th move before defending brilliantly as Carlsen tried to press his advantage and draw first blood. But after seven tense, excruciating hours, Karjakin managed to salvage a draw when the champion missed a move in the endgame that would have assured checkmate.  Moments later, they agreed to a draw after 78 moves. That left a short turnaround for the following dayâ€™s game, where Karjakin recovered yet again to force a   marathon that ended in another draw and kept the match level. The resilience that Carlsen had praised on the eve of the match has proven the critical talking point as the match enters the middle act: â€œSergey has studied the game very well, is very knowledgeable and, most of all, heâ€™s extremely resilient in defense. Heâ€™s very, very good in finding resources even in difficult positions, finding positions he can defend.  â€œFor me, itâ€™s a matter of when I get the chance, Iâ€™ll try to punch him until he finally knocks over. â€ It seems inevitable that Carlsenâ€™s blows will find their target, but for now the Russian underdog is very much in the fight.",67,704,"877333304583651329	877336178638241792	877370214291296256	877371842658312192	877460314710831104	877478682339790848	877519885634596866	877524485796220928	877536624762028035	877664414899589120	877664716847550464	877670340998164480	877686752386760705	877701071287853057	877701104846462977	877724835383848960	877770122013720576	877793396462460928	877793551806980096	877808250598699008	877817886282178561	877823729782317061	877827230780366848	877827512163745793	877848716232630272	877874139134078976	877878275158274049	877878513407217664	877880522353106944	877892372574519297	877927555231236097	877938305962131457	877945064739057664	877991764421820416	877996128792346625	878006362097147904	878012727750479873	878015937294647296	878016502808453120	878018016964878336	878018291129737216	878018448965554176	878018852872798208	878019088680837120	878019434421469184	878034712173752320	878036423642828801	878040461566398465	878042596378935296	878049116646854657	878050822877102081	878059610153689088	878060331171491840	878070818508480512	878073263976361984	878086524948148225	878089071003815937	878094082156908544	878100872672272384	878109974467104768	878112027624914944	878114801037099010	878125264831561728	878149191947608064	878153375140859904	878166725073657857	878182439515963392	878198772832116737	878199075861962752	878199759495979008	878224500801798145	878228033202786304	878228260932407296	878230111262130176	878235494957670401	878244172972531721	878248077076742148	878248912737492992	878249685848178689	878253901727674368	878256353629712384	878259171925278721	878260872002523138	878266629909397504	878267596713451520	878267963488354307	878268610376060928	878279576035758081	878286789777145856	878286972120440832	878304861128802304	878305745237704706	878313464766267392	878324280047443968	878333572138110977	878334842567614464	878340191366377472	878341337229209600	878347793022234624	878352406660218881	878362809532375041	878368456348811264	878376142385823744	878388720654835712	878410319210610688	878410918153027584	878412766561697794	878413749090226176	878421328558080000	878426643181785092	878429636107087875	878435293921243136	878435310920761349	878437636872048641	878438243867426816	878440344232349696	878446087190622208	878464378424741888	878465399439872000	878467698300203008	878499252644839425	878499301554565120	878521300104478720	878525889230786560	878552079270334468	878579466141827072	878580164573241345	878587419926253569	878594069139738624	878596249263288321	878616661670191106	878628721338593280	878644538855895040	878660005007810561	878668559295139841	878668935255740416	878686121282207744	878686940694024192	878694807744458754	878714577508323328	878716369990291457	878725232164581378	878771248951701504	878771448231460864	878776525193179136	878781563055616000	878784141923409920	878785694411493377	878794110110511104	878797378438008832	878804180290252800	878809936729427969	878810831181549568	878810840660574212	878816041543114752	878821915779104769	878849918001188864	878861744009080832	878873080004726785	878919688096501760	878976847656230912	878979209556877313	878984964280332288	878995421640753152	878998975323484161	879000391026958336	879001849122009088	879002268409843712	879012543364296704	879052119843762177	879068191401574400	879072990130053120	879083960051093504	879107772813594624	879126473222705153	879150859321565184	879154369664614400	879196799914868737	879221450837827584	879315386155532288	879320114994323456	879334538664714240	879370295152431104	879407587858558976	879416668690296833	879431625599332353	879440877122400256	879470653866299392	879470701249314816	879488445076430848	879494473369124865	879496967721766912	879558669687562240	879561495398535168	879594647429021696	879611873062203392	879671317880070146	879736958976741377	879737208747569152	879737830926426113	879738234707873792	879738476459175941	879752873504067584	879764775445594114	879785489162682368	879836994565701638	879851377899560960	879851912245387264	880107518529286145	880200274052296705	880403717148815361	880429122937384961	882077552365506562	882672479377866752	884183649746341888	893818625798225920	893826478177112065	900743917758500864	901470097126117376	910684988156325888",fake
politifact15052,www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/there-blood-everywhere-terrified-students-12029466,"Inside the Snapchat bloodbath: 60 minutes of terror which left 17 dead, bodies in classrooms and kids 'full of blood'","The German political mainstream is getting increasingly nervous about the effect that the rise of fake news might have on federal elections next autumn. Fake news and Russian interference  â€”   either by influencing fake news sites, or by hacking or misinformation  â€”   are viewed as a serious threat to the democratic process, particularly since the US presidential elections. From rumours that Merkel was in the east German secret police, the Stasi, to others suggesting she is Adolf Hitlerâ€™s daughter, Germans are also proving themselves susceptible to false information. The most blatant example of fake news to hit Germany so far occurred earlier this year over reports that a    girl of Russian origin, known as Lisa F, had been raped in Berlin by refugees from the Middle East. The story received extensive coverage on Russian and German media who reported the allegations that she had been abducted on her way to school and  . The attack turned out to have been fabricated, as Berlinâ€™s chief of police was quick to point out. According to Berlinâ€™s public prosecutorâ€™s office the girl had spent 30 hours with people known to her, and a medical examination proved she had not been raped. But having been shared widely on social media and through Russian news sites, hundreds took to the streets to protest at the â€œattackâ€ along with far right and   groups. Sergey Lavrov, Russiaâ€™s foreign minister went so far as to accuse Merkelâ€™s government of â€œsweeping the case under the carpetâ€ heightening suspicions in Berlin that the Kremlin was deliberately trying to cause trouble. There are suspicions that the story was spread in the first place by Russian elements keen to undermine the refugee policy of Angela Merkel. She is viewed as a key enemy to Russia over her tough stance on Ukraine. The ultimate aim is said to be to destabilise her domestically just as she has said she will stand for a fourth term in office. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine   MaaÃŸen  â€”   the head of the BfV, Germanyâ€™s domestic security agency,  â€”   accused Russia of using   techniques of misinformation. Addressing the Bundestag on the subject last week, Merkel said: â€œToday we have fake sites, bots, trolls  â€”   things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms, and we have to learn to deal with them. â€ Fake news has also spread to neighbouring Austria and been used to discredit both candidates in this weekendâ€™s presidential election. Most startling have been the attacks on the   independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen, whose opponents have attempted to spread the news that he is suffering from dementia and is gravely ill.  Kate Connolly, Over the last 10 years, France has seen a sharp increase in the readership of alternative,   sites, blogs and social media operations, referred to collectively as the fachosphÃ¨re  â€”   (â€œfachoâ€ is slang for fascist). Promoting views including   nativism and   these sites are run independently, rather than by a political party. But they feed into a mood of distrust of the traditional media, both on the far right and the far left. Samuel Laurent, head of Le Mondeâ€™s   section, Les dÃ©codeurs, said: â€œIn France, there isnâ€™t a wide presence of totally invented fake news that makes money through advertising, as seen in the US. â€ But he said France was seeing increasing cases of manipulation and distortion, particularly during election periods.  One example, in the recent primary race to choose the French rightâ€™s presidential candidate, was a campaign on the fachosphÃ¨re to claim the   candidate Alain JuppÃ© was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The accusation dated back to local elections in 2014 when distorted stories circulated on a   opinion website, accusing JuppÃ© of wanting to build a â€œ â€ in Bordeaux, where he is mayor. The story grew and was embellished during the primary campaigns to portray JuppÃ© as a Muslim   â€œAli JuppÃ©â€. JuppÃ© said a â€œdisgusting campaignâ€ had been run against him.  Laurent said: â€œI think the French presidential election campaign [next spring] will be fraught with this type of thing. â€ In January, as the presidential election campaign prepares to kick off, Le Mondeâ€™s Les dÃ©codeurs will launch a database of questionable sites that portray themselves as information sites. The recent Paris terrorist attacks were also subject to conspiracy theories and distortions, including reports this summer that gunmen who killed 90 people at a rock gig at the Bataclan last November had mutilated their victims. These reports cited partial evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the attacks, without adding that the inquiry also heard officials deny that any mutilation took place. There is also an ongoing row over fake information websites about abortion in France. The lower house of the French parliament has approved government plans to ban fake abortion information websites which masquerade as neutral, official sites with   helpline numbers but which the government said promote   propaganda and pressure women not to terminate pregnancies. The womenâ€™s minister, Laurence Rossignol, told parliament on Thursday that   groups in France were setting up sites â€œthat appear neutral and objectiveâ€ and copy official government information sites but were â€œdeliberately seeking to trick womenâ€. She said these sites often had helplines run by â€œ  activists with no training who want to make women feel guilty and discourage them from seeking an abortion. â€  Angelique Chrisafis  A Burmese friend recently put it like this: in the old days, people went to the tea shop to get their news. Now, they go to Facebook. After decades of isolation under successive military regimes, Myanmarâ€™s 51 million people began to come online rapidly in 2014 after telecoms reforms. They leapfrogged the era of   and desktops, starting with mobile phones and social media. For many, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. With scores of voices clamoring to be heard for the first time, itâ€™s a dynamic, sometimes dangerous space. As well as â€œ#foreveraloneâ€ statuses and a barrage of updates from staunchly   media organizations, news feeds are crammed with fake content. Much of it is tinged with religious hatred. With tensions between the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim populations running high, many are ready to believe vitriolic nonsense about Islam and its followers, often propagated by nationalist accounts set up for the purpose. A Muslim journalist was recently the victim of a campaign by some of these accounts, when a widely followed nationalist posted pictures of him juxtaposed with images of an unknown Rohingya Muslim militant. The post claimed he was involved in attacks on border police and called for his immediate arrest.  Nothing happened  â€”   the post was eventually taken down, though not before more than 3, 000 people shared it. But the episode was a hint of the frightening power that fake news can have in a context like Myanmar. Poppy McPherson, In Italy, the spread of propaganda has become such a worry for the government that a top official in prime minister Matteo Renziâ€™s circle of advisers recently filed a defamation complaint against a mystery Twitter account  â€”   it has since disappeared  â€”   who tweeted under the name â€œBeatrice di Maioâ€ and routinely took aim at Renziâ€™s government. In one example, the Twitter account showed a picture of Elena Boschi, the reform minister, on the phone. It suggested she was sharing insider information with her father, who was a top executive at Banca Etruria, a Tuscan bank. The bank was rescued by the Italian government in 2015 but there is no evidence that Boschi helped her father or committed wrongdoing.  In Italy the attacks against Renzi have been stepped up ahead of the critical 4 December referendum. In some cases, news about Italy reported by Russian   website RT Today has been especially skewed against the prime minister. In one case highlighted by La Stampa, the Italian daily, the Russian website falsely claimed that a rally in Rome held by supporters of Renzi ahead of the referendum were actually his opponents. The story has since been removed.  Members of Renziâ€™s Democratic party have complained that â€œ â€ websites controlled by the   Five Star Movement, which abhors traditional political advertising, are to blame for spreading false and defamatory news about the governmentâ€™s activities.  Stephanie Kirchgaessner, As reports emerged that fake news had influenced the US presidential election, China trumpeted its system of a â€œinternet managementâ€ portraying freedom of speech as broken when it can affect the outcome of an election. â€œChina is on its way to strengthening internet management,â€ said an editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid affiliated with the Communist party mouthpiece Peopleâ€™s Daily. â€œThe western democratic system appears to be unable to addressâ€ the problems and conflict unleashed by the internet, the paper added. The fake news that spread on Facebook in the   to the election even spread to China. Articles originally posted on   websites, including Breitbart, were directly translated into Chinese and shared on the countryâ€™s social media platforms.  Problems with fake news and fraudulent reporters have existed for over a decade in China, with people often presenting themselves as journalists and threatening companies with negative coverage in an attempt to extort money. In one   case, a journalist was paid more than $70, 000 to write negative stories about a construction equipment manufacturing company, sending its shares tumbling. But the authorities have seized on the phenomenon as a justification to censor a   of content. In 2013, the government launched a crackdown on online â€œ â€ targeting influential users on the   website Sina Weibo, but it was widely seen as an attempt to stem criticism of the ruling Communist party. More recently, Chinese authorities have clamped down on â€œfake newsâ€ they feel harms social cohesiveness, targeting â€œrumoursâ€ that affected property prices in Shanghai or stories the government says increase antagonism between urban and rural residents.  Earlier this year Chinaâ€™s cyberspace administration issued new rules designed to curb the number of stories using information culled from social media, stating â€œit is forbidden to use hearsay to create news or use conjecture and imagination to distort the factsâ€. News outlets cannot use information posted on social media without prior approval, it said. More recently a top official at the administration suggested there should be a database to identify internet usersâ€™ true identities so they could be â€œrewarded and punishedâ€. China maintains extensive control over the internet and many foreign websites, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube, are all blocked by a government program known as â€œthe Great Firewallâ€.  The countryâ€™s vast censorship system that imposes media blackouts on topics ranging from missteps by Chinaâ€™s leadership to investigating corruption cases. A recent directive banned websites from live streaming coverage of the US election. Benjamin Haas, Brazil has a growing problem with fake news and its importance has grown as political opinion polarized following the close   victory of leftist president Dilma Rousseff in 2014 and her controversial impeachment in August this year. According to a BBC Brasil report from April 2016, as the impeachment process that Rousseff and her supporters called a politically motivated coup began heating up, three out of the five most shared news stories on Facebook were false.  A story shared by the Pensa Brasil (Think Brasil) site that falsely said that federal police wanted to know why Rousseff had given 30bn reais ($9bn) to the giant meat company Friboi came third in the ranking with 90, 150 shares.  Last year Brazilian journalist Tai Nalon left her job at the Folha de S Paulo, one of Brazilâ€™s leading newspapers, to found the site Aos Fatos (To The Facts)  â€”   Brazilâ€™s first   site. â€œThere is a lot of false news,â€ Nalon said in an email interview, â€œbut I would be cautious about saying the problem is similar to what happens in the USAâ€. Instead, she said there are politically motivated pages that reinterpret and distort existing stories from big news outlets and that much of what they share is more biased opinion than pure falsehood. But plenty of false stories do circulate on Brazilâ€™s garrulous internet. The   investigation into the Petrobras scandal, called Operation Car Wash, was a key driver in Rousseffâ€™s impeachment. Although she has never been accused of graft, many in her party have been and the scandal prompted huge street demonstrations calling for her removal. BuzzFeed Brasil this month published this story about how more false news about the operation has been published than real. This year, the 10 most popular false news stories about Car Wash were shared 3. 9m times, BuzzFeed said, citing Facebook data. The 10 most popular real stories were shared 2. 7m times. Dominic Phillips, Fake news is not a problem of any scale in Australia: the media market, dominated by a handful of key players serving a population of just over 21 million people, does not seem fragmented enough. But Australia is not immune to issues with untruths spreading on Facebook. Over half the population (13. 3 million as at end of June) is connected to the internet of that number, more than half is believed to be active on Facebook. Some issues seem to be more of a lightning rod for untruths in Australia than others. The link between the halal certification industry and terrorism  â€”   repeated by politicians despite a lack of evidence  â€”   was so persistent that an inquiry was held late last year. Concerns over halal certification  â€”   often failing to completely mask rampant Islamophobia  â€”   flourished on Facebook, even after the inquiry found there was no basis to the connection. The Boycott Halal in Australia group has close to 100, 000 members on Facebook. In November 2014, it shared a satirical news article, apparently under the impression it was true. The post was subsequently deleted, but the page is a hotbed for views that have no basis in fact, as is the page for supporters of the Q Society, which bills itself as â€œAustraliaâ€™s leading   movementâ€. Pauline Hanson, a fringe figure in rightwing politics who is outspoken against Islam, was   to the senate in the federal election in July with support that surprised many pundits. Her One Nation party took four seats in the   senate this year and the party is expected to do well in the Queensland state elections. Parallels have been drawn between her return to politics and Trumpâ€™s election: both have embraced social media, where they have significant followings, and are similarly unfazed by evidence. In August, research showed 62% of voters agreed with the statement: â€œI might not personally agree with everything she says but she is speaking for a lot of ordinary Australians. â€ She is active on Facebook, as are many of her supporters. She recently announced that the majority of her press releases would be released only on Twitter.  Elle Hunt, After Indiaâ€™s prime minister announced the introduction of a new,   note last month, phones around the country lit up with the news the bill would come installed with a surveillance chip, linked to a satellite that could track the notes even 120 metres underground. The claims, debunked by the countryâ€™s reserve bank, nonetheless spread like fire over Whatsapp  â€”   which has more than 50 million users in India  â€”   and migrated into mainstream news. As in the United States and elsewhere, increasing numbers of Indians are getting their news from social media.  But the   episode illustrates the deeper impact of fake news in a country where media is prolific, but journalistic standards, especially in regional media, can still fall short.  â€œMainstream media in India is more impacted by the phenomena [of fake news] because they broadcast these kinds of stories without verifying,â€ says Prabhakar Kumar, from the Indian media research agency, CMS. â€œThere is no standard policy for TV news and newspapers about the process of researching and publishing stories. â€ Police have arrested people accused of concocting false stories, especially when they run the risk of igniting communal tension. Administrators of Whatsapp groups have been warned they could be held responsible for the messages they oversee.  But social media has only enabled a much older reliance on rumour and innuendo, especially in Indiaâ€™s villages. Two boys in Dadri village, near Delhi, didnâ€™t need Whatsapp last year to spread rumours a local man was storing beef in his freezer. They broadcast from the loudspeaker at the village temple. Mohammed Akhlaq, the    labourer named by the boys, was lynched.

politifact15309,http://nrtonline.info/breaking-nancy-pelosi-to-resign-after-new-revelations/,BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi To Resign After New Revelations – NRTOnline,"Itâ€™s hard to believe that Dave Chappelle hasnâ€™t hosted Saturday Night Live before. It seems impossible that someone who has influenced comedy like he has would have never received a   moment like that. Then again, Chappelle made himself scarce in the years after walking away from his massive hit series Chappelleâ€™s Show. Plus, SNL  â€”   though the launching pad for Eddie Murphyâ€™s meteoric rise to superstardom  â€”   has rarely been amenable to the talents of black comedians. That Chappelle is choosing this as his major comeback vehicle (and bringing A Tribe Called Quest along with him) is significant, especially at a time when itâ€™s fair to wonder where black comedy is headed in the second half of the decade. Iâ€™ve seen Dave Chappelle perform live twice: at the height of Chappelleâ€™s Showâ€™s success at a   theater in Fresno, California, and this year, in Los Angeles, on the eve of the Academy awards. The latter show took place inside a Latin dance club near Echo Park. We were made to hand over our cellphones so as not to spoil a raucous evening that included guest appearances by Oscar host Chris Rock (testing out material for his Oscar hosting gig) and Christopher â€œKidâ€ Reid from Kid â€˜n Play. That Fresno show was tight, controlled and traditional. The LA show included a running gag about orgasming, lots of cigarettes and the occasional blunt. It was a    monologue that would be familiar to anyone whoâ€™s seen Chappelle live in the past few years  â€”   as if   Lenny Bruce didnâ€™t have to fight against censorship and could just get high on stage and ramble. That formless, meandering style lends itself to glib, controversial rhetoric like his recent comments on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the Cutting Room in New York. He called Trump â€œthe most gangsta candidate everâ€ and while acknowledging that he voted for Clinton, said that â€œsheâ€™s not right, and we all know sheâ€™s not rightâ€. Chappelleâ€™s canonical status as a comic allows him these sorts of indulgences and I canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t enjoy myself, but I canâ€™t help but yearn for the focused, hungry Chappelle who I worshipped as a young adult. As an awkward biracial kid in a small town, Chappelle was the first black comic I could relate to. He straddled the line between worlds in a way that even Eddie Murphy couldnâ€™t. Chappelle was vulnerable before white comics like Louis CK and Marc Maron made that cool, and well before black standups like Hannibal Buress and W Kamau Bell could get away with it. But he was never patronizing or disinterested in his own blackness the way Bill Cosby could be. Historically, black comedy has been about bravado, about decibel levels, and about playing to the crowd  â€”   Murphyâ€™s swagger in Raw and Delirious, Richard Pryorâ€™s bare emotional intensity and confidence, Redd Foxxâ€™s bawdy misanthropy, and Bernie Macâ€™s grumpy old man ferocity. Itâ€™s a tradition typified by Def Comedy Jam, the Russell Simmons institution thatâ€™s returning to TV this weekend, the same night that Chappelle hosts SNL. The special, All Def Comedy, is a revival of sorts for the Def Comedy brand and a spinoff of a digital series produced by Simmonsâ€™s All Def Digital   brand. Looking at the lineup it seems that black comedy hasnâ€™t changed much since Chappelle went home. All Def is hosted by Chris Rockâ€™s brother Tony, a fixture at LAâ€™s Laugh Factory and the   MC for shows like this. Tony also hosted the   Showtime at the Apollo revival, Apollo Live on BET. A glance at some of the YouTube clips of the listed performers reveals common themes that run through the history of black standup: the inscrutability of black women, infidelity, the great mysteries of the bowel movement and the trials and tribulations of being broke. The supremely confident, strong black comic is personified today by people like Kevin Hart, arguably the biggest comedy star in the country today  â€”   at least in terms of his ability to consistently draw fans to movie theaters, football stadiums and various home media devices. Thereâ€™s certainly   in Hartâ€™s work: his persona is that of someone who projects authority and   but constantly subverts that image. Itâ€™s a deft modernization of the black comic standard. Thereâ€™s also SNL cast member Leslie Jones, who derives many of her laughs from her booming voice and unshakeable belief in herself, a character trait that became invaluable during her recent struggles with Twitter trolls and the  . But that was never Chappelle. From the conceptual absurdity of his   baby bit to the laconic stoner humor of   Chappelle never seemed to embrace the theatrics of Rock or Murphy (and their descendent, Hart). His crackly voice and lanky frame didnâ€™t lend themselves to the gravitas of those people. His tendency to crack up or appear mystified by his own jokes (signified by a habit of slapping his microphone on his thigh) was endearing, not intimidating. His inviting,   persona might have opened the door for the complicated response to Chappelleâ€™s Show that drove him away from the spotlight. A recent piece in The Fader by Amos Barshad looked back at the sketch that pushed Chappelle away  â€”   a racially charged bit of satire that a white audience member enjoyed way too much for his liking. Without the air of menace, the sex appeal, or authority that Rock, Murphy, Pryor, Foxx and others brought to their work, Chappelle might have made the jokes we all tell ourselves in the barber shops or basketball courts acceptable to white folks  â€”   putting black pain on a Hot Topic  . That he walked away says more about his intelligence and keen sense of empathy than anything else in his body of work. He couldnâ€™t stand to profit from work he didnâ€™t believe in, which is not necessarily true of many of his peers in black comedy. After all, Robert Townsend directed BAPS and Bill Bellamy was in whatever this was supposed to be. The influence of Chappelle is felt in comics such as Buress, the Lucas Brothers, Wyatt Cenac, Eric Andre and others  â€”   acts that donâ€™t struggle to appeal to white audiences and donâ€™t really fit in the baroque Def Jam mold. Black comedy today is seeing the same sort of divide between   and club comics that fundamentally altered the white comic landscape in the 1990s and 2000s. Chappelle could do both and based on the diverse makeup of the tiny club show I saw, he still can. The thing is, the Def Jam comic will always be a necessary part of the black cultural experience. He or she is a conduit for our frustrations, an avatar of strength in the face of rampant prejudice, and a keen observer of a world most people donâ€™t understand. Theyâ€™re also, to borrow a phrase, for us and by us in a society dominated by whiteness as status quo. Chappelle might have retreated from the siren song of the mainstream because they didnâ€™t really understand him (or even care to) but hopefully what we will see on Saturday night is a reminder of how he got so close in the first place.",35,208,"937265170971332609	937444150504513539	937452077256671233	937454484585832448	937454862786289664	937491406196748289	937527203247648768	937746810726178817	937771692717428736	938128676666925056	938130441068056576	938178135690039296	938199866169352192	938202378242846720	938205335151669248	938205880935383041	938207489857744896	938220513549107200	938222795380551682	938232268052721665	938244610236846085	938250223767425024	938264323146829824	938375555791044608	938521193648402432	938544793352916992	938618229890613248	938700499829841921	938815580206968836	938872220570603521	938876497279975424	938893172595396608	938897022467354624	938985071196782594	939220550009933825	939372671074295808	939528633244413954	940363874599096322	940476744464850944	942494799285780481	942601249119227904	942776169945907200	942878704216301568	942957412599975936	943047085506654209	943094036365299712	943109281460736000	943324744295870465	943589261990752256	944957248748556288	944957396023238657	944957417770618880	944957744821436417	944958110891851777	944958114868092928	944958119154663425	944958117590179840	944958151652241409	944958894345990144	944958946158276609	944960885012946946	944961267189583873	944962959331250176	944964754430455808	944964793730867200	944976002458849280	945036602375659523	945482558728314880	951964527939211265	951972721822392320	960702624503808000	970696642146922496	970703078533074944	970801971207856128	970876679899025409	971444937857396739	971445574636457984	971456329079541761	971485704206409729	971523190244732928	971526559059333121	971533573189701632	971583092904226816	972582639776362496	972601991821254656	973517564780347392	973609053422276610	973619167189401600	974729809220853760	974752848138321920	974768077270323201	974857966783467521	975020677249032192	975134116101459968	975159137184223234	975595630004527104	975726661470752768	975726675886403584	975940875741220864	977124786613686272	978144750871240705	978316317492101120	980297768261619712	981229048843075584	983992537911300107	984066002517463040	988409919631249408	990644381899247616	1041897725078450176",fake

The Airbus A320 flight MS804 from Paris to Cairo disappeared from radar screens between the Greek island of Crete and the north coast of Egypt on 19 May.   people were on board. A vast search operation was launched, finding debris and pieces of the planeâ€™s fuselage at the bottom of the Mediterranean, before the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered last week. The   investigative committee began examining the black boxes on Saturday in the presence of representatives from France and the United States, where the engine was made, said Egyptâ€™s civil aviation authority. Both of the devices were damaged and had to be raised from the seabed in several stages, said the authority. Their memory units were removed at the civil aviation ministryâ€™s labs in Cairo and were undergoing testing, it said. The data on them is to be unloaded, before it is analysed in a procedure that is expected to last several weeks. If badly damaged, the black boxes would be sent abroad for repairs, otherwise the work could be done in Egypt. Investigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the plane to crash, although a terror attack has not been ruled out. Franceâ€™s aviation safety agency has said the aircraft transmitted automated messages indicating smoke in the cabin and a fault in the flight control unit minutes before it disappeared. On Monday, Egyptian investigators confirmed the aircraft had made a   left turn followed by a   turn to the right before hitting the sea. The passengers on the plane were 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians, and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. They included a boy and two babies. Seven crew and three security personnel were also on board. The crash came after the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egyptâ€™s restive Sinai Peninsula last October that killed all 224 people on board.",317,238,"812333495020195841	812333821945376773	812334325958115328	812370137290575873	812453775583625216	812465229552644096	812468786330640384	812584289355333632	812604223263244288	817214944273776641",fake

While our new foreign secretaryâ€™s comments may have been inappropriate   and wrong   his brain, like most peopleâ€™s, was subject to an overwhelming impulse to find a possible motivation for an action as soon as it occurs. Our desire to understand the motivations of a killer involves a particular part of the brain called the â€˜  junctionâ€™. Also known as the â€˜mindreadingâ€™ area of the brain, it automatically ascribes possible incentives, beliefs and desires to others. This reflex developed to help us socialise, but is so powerful that we also apply it to inanimate objects such as computers, shouting, â€˜Why are you doing this to me?â€™ as they crash yet again.

But as genre fans are well aware, itâ€™s also long been a haven for the best horror films the industry has to offer. Recent spooky sensations to have premiered at Sundance include The Babadook, Jennifer Kentâ€™s powerhouse debut, which defied genre conventions to win a slew of awards and land on countless top 10 lists in 2014 and Robert Eggersâ€™ eerie period thriller The Witch, which is bound to do solid business when it opens in late February, just over a year after winning the festivalâ€™s best director award. (The Guardianâ€™s Jordan Hoffmann praised The Witch in his   Sundance review, writing that â€œits focus on themes over plot is what elevates it to something near greatness. â€) This yearâ€™s unarguable horror standout was Under the Shadow, the   debut of Iranian director Babak Anvari. The     film arrived in Park City with a Netflix streaming deal already in place it will also be screened in cinemas. Set in Tehran in 1988, at the height of the   war, when Iraqi bombs pelted down, Under the Shadow centers on mother Shideh (Narges Rashdi in a   performance) who is forced to care for her young daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) after Shidehâ€™s husband is ordered off to battle. The film doesnâ€™t announce itself as a horror until some distance in, when Dorsa begins alluding to a demonic presence that haunts her. Up until that point, Under the Shadow spends its time building up Shideh as a fully formed character at odds with her surroundings, so that when the terror hits, it means something. Anvariâ€™s debut is bracingly feminist in tone, with Shideh leading the charge as an aspiring doctor determined to resume her medical studies, but unable to in Iran due to her past political activism. Her husband, himself a doctor, canâ€™t bring himself to understand his wifeâ€™s longing to forge a career for herself, saying during a heated argument that sheâ€™s trying to fulfill her motherâ€™s dream  â€”   not her own. â€œDead people canâ€™t dream,â€ she solemnly retorts.  The filmâ€™s triumph lies in its ability to critique Iranâ€™s   regime for its blatant sexism (in one harrowing sequence, Shideh is arrested for simply going outdoors without her chador) while still working as a   horror when the demons come out to play. Anvari proves himself to be a master at modulating fear: the jump scares are executed with effective precision, leading up to a magnificently intense climax.  Under its scares, Under the Shadow serves as an impassioned allegory for female oppression  â€”   but Anvari doesnâ€™t shortchange horror fans. He delivers an entertainment thatâ€™s fun to watch, and subversively incisive for those willing to read between the lines.",3,510,"1012165429056409601	1012223385751785472	1012269581803622401	1013823363213594624",fake

The official Twitter account for PokÃ©mon Go tweeted that it was working hard to roll out the game in South Americaâ€™s largest country and told fans to â€œstay tunedâ€.  A representative for Niantic, which developed PokÃ©mon Go for mobile devices, declined to comment on the exact timing of the gameâ€™s release in Brazil. Japanâ€™s Nintendo owns 32% of the PokÃ©mon Company, which owns PokÃ©monâ€™s intellectual property. Some in Brazil have questioned how PokÃ©mon Go players will stay safe. Robbers in other countries have targeted distracted mobile phone players, and Brazilâ€™s steepest economic recession since the 1930s has been stoking crime and straining public finances. There have been threats of police strikes on the eve of the Games.  In the United States, some players have been drawn down dark alleys and into dangerous neighborhoods in search of the imaginary creatures, only to be targeted by criminals. Players have also been involved in car accidents.  The game can work anywhere in the world using GPS, but it is not officially available for download by local users in Brazil.  Athletes who have arrived at the Olympic village have expressed disappointment about the game not being widely available. US diver Abby Johnston tweeted on 26 July that the worst thing about the Olympic village was she could not play the game.  PokÃ©mon Go is available in 35 countries. Players use their mobile devices to search various   locations in hopes of finding and capturing virtual PokÃ©mon characters such as cuddly yellow Pikachu.  The game marries a classic    Nintendo franchise with augmented reality and has surged on Appleâ€™s app charts since its release last month. It is on its way to becoming the first mobile game to break the $   barrier, beating Candy Crush Saga.  Japanese gymnast Kohei Uchimura landed a nearly $5, 000 phone bill in Rio this week, after he was persuaded by his   to download the game shortly after touching down in Brazil for a   training camp last week.

Doig had been sued by a former Canadian corrections officer who claimed the artist was falsely denying that he had made the work. The unusual authentication lawsuit was filed in 2013 after the Scottish artist refused to authenticate the painting when the former corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, and art dealer Peter Bartlow tried to sell it. It required Doig to prove he hadnâ€™t painted the work. â€œI feel a living artist should be the one who gets to say yea or nay and not be taken to task and forced to go back 40 years in time. It was painstaking to piece this together,â€ he said during the ruling, according to the New York Times. Fletcher claimed he and Doig had met at Lakehead University in the 1970s. In 1976, he said he bought the work for $100 from the artist while he was incarcerated at the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre, where Fletcher worked. He said he watched Doig paint the desert landscape, fell in love with it, and purchased it to stop the young man, who had been incarcerated on an LSD charge, from going back to selling drugs. Years later, a friend noticed the painting and suggested that it could have been created by Doig, according to Fletcherâ€™s lawsuit. From there, Fletcher began working with Bartlow, who owns an art gallery in Chicago and is now a   in the case. In the trial, Fletcher and Bartlow attempted to show similarities between the painting and Doigâ€™s other works as evidence. They also claimed his denial was the product of embarrassment over the incarceration or past drug use. Doig, however, said he had never attended the university and had never been incarcerated, citing his school yearbook, his motherâ€™s letters about his whereabouts  â€”   including his role in Romeo and Juliet in high school  â€”   and written testimony from friends as evidence, the New York Times reported. He wrote in court papers that he hadnâ€™t begun to paint on canvas until late 1979. â€œIf I had painted that painting when I was 16, I would admit it,â€ he wrote. Born in Edinburgh in 1959, Doig lived in Trinidad with his family before moving with them to Canada in 1966. He studied art in London on and off between 1979 and 1990. His magical landscape paintings have earned millions  â€”   last year, Swamped, a painting of a moonlit white canoe, sold at action for nearly $26m. Fletcher and Bartlow sought $5m in damages and a declaration that the painting was authentic, since its sale was likely to earn them millions, based on recent sales of Doigâ€™s work. The artistâ€™s lawyers said they identified the real Pete Doige, whose records matched Fletcherâ€™s description. Doige died in 2012, but his sister, Marilyn Doige Bovard, testified at the trial that the work was created by her late brother. In a written statement after the verdict, Doig said of the   trial that â€œjustice prevailed, but it was way too long in comingâ€ according to the BBC. â€œThat a living artist has to defend the authorship of his own work should never have come to pass. â€ A lawyer for the plaintiffs has not yet decided whether they will appeal the decision.",868,366,"331799896837472256	331955269779197952	335229809758195712	335230533527285761	342596661803106304	836348740109799425	836354979065655297	836356643965259776	836366017437773824	836366781086334977	836392474432143363	836396126190329856	836399401576845312	836406389014683648	836409159629307904	836419079422488576	836419785219006471	836421444477173760	836427153889619968	836430240591261696	836446310593146880	836448482080796673	836454596302118912	836459124736970752	836498151955656704	836525814023929857	836531741905014784	836531926810898433	836532583462731776	836578810166448128	836580398679343104	836587194219388928	836587202880684032	836590051022811136	836594755060453376	836602643787177985	836605932742328320	836606904713494528	836611443139166208	836618807036674048	836634838576717826	836636237188509697	836636246336286721	836638690164240384	836639769538912256	836648166267228161	836651253513990144	836685643694497792	836686463324532736	836694233385861120	836709825555927040	836712993010352128	836736012252479488	836736546350977024	836738844670164992	836740598124199936	836743456034799616	836755040694071297	836758140326670336	836759540674756608	836770376994664448	836793976099319808	836794595879108608	836820026334330880	836849506847178757	836868056550887426	836932019221315584	836941259751190528	836953844957478912	836964840405102592	836977453734187008	836979923722125314	836992255856685057	837007905719271440	837026036890144774	837041355209613312	837048664992395264	837081402768261120	837098695829114880	837101780039254017	837109509344616448	837118202610057216	837120125589467141	837121889424244736	837141462571679744	837157103823433729	837201346507980800	837242192355799044	837304604337573888	837312546377986048	837314113671991296	837314128746274817	837336922561392640	837355478548156416	837371003667906560	837392971750379520	837441051166126081	844492852398903296",fake

The Carnegie Deli in midtown Manhattan, a legendary business in the city and just steps away from the renowned, eponymous concert hall after which it is named, will serve its last pastrami on rye on New Yearâ€™s Eve, after more than 80 years. As regulars and tourists lined up in high emotion for hours this week to savor one last bowl of matzo ball soup or helping of latkes, the young boss of its downtown fellow icon, Katzâ€™s Deli, has marked its imminent loss. â€œThe Carnegie Deli will shut its doors for the last time on December 31 and we New Yorkers have already started mourning,â€ wrote Jake Dell in a letter to the New York Times published on Thursday. Dell owns the internationally renowned Katzâ€™s in Manhattanâ€™s Lower East Side neighborhood. The corner establishment is almost 120 years old and famous for its signs exhorting wartime families to â€œsend a salami to your boy in the armyâ€ its cameo in the film When Harry Met Sally, a confusing ticketing system and epic Jewish food staples served in   surroundings. â€œI am deeply saddened to witness the disappearance of a fellow culinary landmark,â€ Dell wrote about the Carnegie Deli. A little younger than Katzâ€™s, the Carnegie has long drawn the theater crowd to its spot on Seventh Avenue, not far from Times Square, where paneled walls in   dining areas are crowded with signed pictures of the stars who have enjoyed its overstuffed reuben sandwiches or slices of brisket over the years. â€œDeli is about brining   â€¦     patience   â€¦     preservation, not just of meat but of tradition,â€ Dell wrote. The nearby Stage Deli preceded Carnegie out of Midtown four years ago when it closed, and the classic Second Avenue Deli left its old East Village spot a decade ago. Meanwhile, vintage American diners are also departing the city relentlessly and now number in the couple of hundreds where they used to exceed a thousand, and the traditional neon shop signs that brighten the nights in â€œthe city that never sleepsâ€ are disappearing along with them. The Carnegie Deli had experienced a   variety of financial hurdles in recent times, from a pay dispute to a safety crackdown and even a contentious divorce among the ownership. But Katzâ€™s Dell also pointed out that while businesses cherish the bustle of New York City, they also â€œagonize over the nonstop gentrification when we lose too many of our classics   â€¦     as we wistfully watch yet another great legend fall by the waysideâ€. Celebrated chef Anthony Bourdain lists Katzâ€™s and the classic smoked fish and bagel emporium, Russ  Daughters, nearby on Houston Street, among his favorite city eateries. So Dell had a promise on Thursday â€œto deli lovers the world overâ€: he plans to open another branch in Brooklyn this spring and the original business is continuing to expand its delivery and mail order services, in addition to packing them in around the plain tables for pickles and pastrami from breakfast time to the wee hours. â€œKatzâ€™s is not going anywhere,â€ he wrote.

But advocates for the preventive health measures are warning that the Trump administration could threaten or even reverse momentum. â€œI think there is going to be some battles to be fought to maintain ground and not lose ground,â€ said David Goldberg, a spokesperson for Healthy Food America (HFA) a key supporter of these taxes. In October, the World Health Organization urged all nations to consider a sugary drink tax to curb obesity, cut health care costs and increase revenue for health services. WHO has found that a 20% increase in price led to fewer people consuming sugary drinks. It said taxes would have the greatest positive impact on the young and people with low incomes. Sugary drink tax success in the US has followed momentum internationally. Several countries have introduced the taxes in recent years, including Mexico, which introduced the tax in January 2014 and the UK, which is set to introduce its sugary drink tax in 2018. When 2016 started, Berkeley, California was the only US jurisdiction with a sugary drink tax, which passed in 2014. But this year, Americans voted by referendum to institute the taxes in four cities, and city officials passed taxes in two other metropolitan areas: Philadelphia and Cook County, Illinois  â€”   a 5. 2 million person jurisdiction that includes Chicago. Now, sugary drink tax supporters see the US federal government as a threat to these developments.    Donald Trump campaigned against lobbyists, but his transition team included Michael Torrey, a lobbyist who runs a firm that helps the main soda lobby, the American Beverage Association. Torrey was tasked with helping set up the Department of Agriculture team, according to the New York Times. And in early December, Trump named fast food executive Andy Puzder as head of the labor department.  â€œWe just have to be vigilant and try to protect gains that have been made in recent years,â€ Goldberg said. â€œBut meanwhile, regardless of what the lobbyists are doing at the federal level, we think local communities will keep making progressâ€.  New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle, author of Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning) said progress on soda taxes has been outstanding, but it was difficult to predict how Trump and a   Congress would act towards public health initiatives.  â€œNobody seems very interested in public health in the group thatâ€™s coming in, but we have to wait and see  â€”   it doesnâ€™t look promising,â€ she said. â€œIf I were   Iâ€™d be in Congress right nowâ€. The beverage industry, for its part, said the success of sugar tax laws has been exaggerated.  â€œThe   advocates are going to areas that are more predisposed to taxes and I just donâ€™t see taxes sweeping the middle of the country and people in the middle of the country wanting more government intervention,â€ said Lauren Kane, an American Beverage Association spokeswoman.  She noted that the taxes won by popular vote in some of the healthiest cities in the country: Boulder, Colorado and San Francisco.  But that skepticism has not stopped the industry from spending millions of dollars to combat these local laws. The 2016 sugar tax votes were some of the most expensive ballot measures nationwide, with the American Beverage Association, spending $38m to try and defeat the measures.   tax campaigns, meanwhile, were backed by billionaire donors such as Laura and John Arnold, whose foundation donates to HFA, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who donated nearly $20m to efforts in Californiaâ€™s Bay Area.  The taxes are also being introduced after decades of falling soda sales as consumers move away from sugary drinks in favor of healthier options.  â€œThe reality is that they [the beverage industry] are facing a public that understands the increased health risks from sugar drinks and they are facing local policy makers and local community advocates who know what their communities need,â€ said Jim Oâ€™Hara, the director of health promotion policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a   that supports sugar taxes. Oâ€™Hara said local needs would outweigh national political debates about these local health laws.  â€œMr Trump will be the president of the United States,â€ Oâ€™Hara said. â€œHeâ€™s not going to be the mayor or governor in cities or states across the countyâ€.

politifact14544,www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/susan-rice-house-investigators-unmasked-trump-officials/index.html,Rice told investigators why she unmasked Trump aides,"An Australian man arrested for attempting to rape a    boy at a paedophile party while on on a rugby union trip in the US has been sentenced to 12 years in jail by a Los Angeles judge. Michael Quinn, 33, an IVF geneticist from Melbourne, was caught in May in LA in a sting set up by US authorities who posed as paedophiles and a pimp offering to supply him with a    boy to rape for $US250 ($A330). Quinn, who played for the Melbourne Chargers, wept throughout his sentencing and claimed it was the first time he had attempted to prey on a child. â€œIf you give me a second chance I wonâ€™t let you down,â€ he told US district court judge John Walter. Quinnâ€™s lawyer had asked for 10 years. Walter sentenced Quinn to the term prosecutors had asked for. The veteran judge described Australianâ€™s desire to attend what Quinn believed was a paedophile party at an LA hotel room and pay a pimp to allow him to rape a young boy as â€œabsolutely disgustingâ€ â€œghastlyâ€ and â€œdespicableâ€. The party was a sting set up by undercover US authorities who had been communicating with Quinn online for several weeks in Melbourne before he departed on a rugby trip to the US with some of his Chargers  . â€œAussie perv, heading to the US late   interested to meet others while Iâ€™m there. LA, Nashville, NYC,â€ Quinn posted on a social media site used by paedophiles. A US undercover agent saw the post and began communicating with Quinn. The geneticist told him of his wish to rape a boy and authorities set up the sting for when he arrived in LA in May. Quinn claimed that he had never molested a child the sting was the first opportunity offered him. His lawyer, Lisa Shinar LaBarre, said Quinnâ€™s severe addiction to methamphetamine had altered his thinking and created psychotic thoughts. Quinn had also claimed to have been abused as a child. The court heard that a psychologist who examined Quinn in jail concluded it was unlikely he would reoffend. The judge said he was not â€œoverly impressedâ€ by the doctorâ€™s report, noting that Quinn had not undergone standard testing for pedophilia. â€œIt upsets me so much that I could be capable of harming a child,â€ Quinn, dressed in a white prison jumpsuit, told the judge. He also apologised to Australia for â€œdamaging its reputationâ€ and told the court: â€œI never want to put a child in danger again. â€ Judge Walter said he did not â€œbuyâ€ the cause and effect of Quinnâ€™s drug addiction and the abuse he suffered as a child. â€œThe defendant had every intention of raping a boy,â€ the judge said.

politifact13677,https://newsbreakshere.com/breaking-meryl-streep-just-got-fired-major-project-lying-trump-2,BREAKING: Meryl Streep Just Got Fired From A Major Project For Lying About Trump -,"Barack Obama has defended free trade and condemned â€œcrude populismâ€ in what is in effect an open letter to his successor in the White House. Writing in the Economist, the president does not mention Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump by name but makes clear that he disagrees with both candidatesâ€™ opposition to the   Partnership (TPP). Obama sets out a vision for Americaâ€™s future based on boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, providing meaningful work opportunities and shoring up the economy against financial storms. In what the Economist describes as â€œa trenchant, unapologetically centrist essayâ€ entitled â€œThe Way Aheadâ€ Obama, who leaves office in January, acknowledges that an anxiety over globalisation had taken hold in the US, not unlike the discontent leading to Britainâ€™s vote in June to leave the European Union. At home and abroad, he writes, people ask him: â€œWhy have some on the far left and even more on the far right embraced a crude populism that promises a return to a past that is not possible to restore  â€”   and that, for most Americans, never existed at all?â€ Obama offers what he believes is a reality check: â€œThe world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease. So we have a choice  â€”   retreat into old,   economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top. â€  In an election year characterised by a wave of   sentiment from Trump and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders, Obama contends that globalisation has been by far a net positive for the American economy. â€œLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade,â€ Obama contends. â€œWhile some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers. â€ Clinton has joined Trump and Sanders in speaking out against the TPP, although some analysts suspect that, should she win the presidency, she will seek to repackage the deal in a manner that allows her to approve it. Obama pledges to keep pushing for Congress to pass the TPP because, he says, it will level the playing field for workers and businesses. In an obvious swipe at Trump, Obama writes of the current air of discontent: â€œThe       and   sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past  â€”   the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the   of the   the   sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again. â€ But he acknowledges that some of the unrest is rooted in â€œlegitimate concernsâ€ about decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality resulting in slower income growth for   and   families. The financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites. â€œSo itâ€™s no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known. â€ Clinton is attempting a broad church election campaign that embraces some ideas from Sanders, a   socialist, but also has the centrist Obama as a leading surrogate. During an electrifying primary campaign, Sanders argued for the breakup of the Wall Street banks. But the president urges against quick fix solutions.  â€œFurther progress requires recognising that Americaâ€™s economy is an enormously complicated mechanism,â€ he writes. â€œAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract  â€”   breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports  â€”   the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people. â€ Obama does, however, devote a section of the essay to widening inequality  â€”   a key theme of Sanders and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren  â€”   and its negative economic and moral consequences. In 1979, he says, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all   income by 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%. â€œThis challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We donâ€™t begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, weâ€™ve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better. â€ He cites technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage as factors in growing inequality. â€œBut I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels  â€”   at church, at their childrenâ€™s schools, in civic organisations. â€œThatâ€™s why CEOs took home about 20 to 30 times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why todayâ€™s CEO is now paid over 250 times more. â€ He urges the next occupant of the White House: â€œIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the   rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition. â€ He also calls for increasing the federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children and limiting tax breaks for   households. Obama further notes that in 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the workforce. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of   women were out of the workforce. Today, it is 26%. â€œInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction,   physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among    Americans  â€”   the group where   participation has fallen most precipitously. â€ Obama proposes increasing access to community colleges and providing wage insurance to those workers who cannot find a job that pays as well as their previous one. He says paid leave and guaranteed sick leave would also encourage flexibility that could lead to more people working.  Championing the achievements of his   presidency, led by preventing the 2008 financial crisis from turning into a great depression, Obama says a foundation was laid for a better future. He suggests that the US should prepare for negative shocks to the economy before they occur and not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need. â€œAmerica must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,â€ he writes.

politifact15280,http://yournewswire.com/clinton-email-we-must-destroy-syria-for-israel/,Clinton Email: We Must Destroy Syria For Israel,"A Canadian airliner with 54 passengers on board had to swerve to avoid a suspected drone near Toronto early on Monday, slightly injuring two cabin crew, in the most serious case of its kind in Canada, officials said.   The Porter Airlines Bombardier Q400   plane, which took off from Ottawa, was at 9, 000ft (2, 750 meters) descending into the cityâ€™s Billy Bishop waterfront airport, when the pilots saw an unmanned aerial vehicle.  â€œTwo crew members performed an evasive maneuver to avoid the unidentified object,â€ said Genevieve Corbin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). Corbin said the object was most likely a drone. Two cabin crew suffered slight injuries during the incident, Porter said.  â€œThe pilotsâ€™ initial assessment was that it looked like a balloon. After debriefing, there is potential that the object was a drone,â€ said Porter Airlines spokesman Brad Cicero.   The plane landed at about 7. 30am ET (12. 30 GMT). The TSB has now launched an investigation, the first time it has done so for such an incident, said Corbin.   In June, Canadaâ€™s federal transport ministry launched a campaign intended to deter people from flying drones near airports or aircraft.   There have been a rash of   between planes and unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States in recent years.   In April, police in Britain said a British Airways passenger aircraft collided with what was most likely a drone as it prepared to land at Londonâ€™s Heathrow airport. The aircraft landed safely and no injuries were reported in the incident.

politifact14310,https://quickening-spirit.com/fareed-zakaria-calls-for-jihad-rape-of-white-women/,CNN host Fareed Zakaria calls for jihad rape of white women,"Facebook is looking for an experienced media executive to help smooth its relationship with the press amid mounting concerns about fake news and the social networkâ€™s influence over the public. On Monday the company began advertising for a head of news partnerships with â€œ20+ years of experience in news, with strong   and understanding across the businessâ€. The requirement means those applying must have started their news career before Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had celebrated his 13th birthday. The applicant will also be expected to be the â€œ  voice of Facebook and its role in the news ecosystemâ€ and â€œa strong voice within Facebook on the goals and priorities of news publishersâ€. The company already has a director of global media partnerships, Andy Mitchell, who has a background on the business side of news organisations, mainly with CNN. It has also employed former journalists in less senior roles. But the latest job ad suggests the company is looking for someone to address concerns raised by media organisations, politicians and others about the social networkâ€™s wider impact. Fake news stories concerning the US election, in particular favouring Donald Trump, have been blamed by some for influencing voters and has pushed Facebookâ€™s role into the spotlight.  The company has also come under scrutiny for removing the famous photograph of a girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam war, manually editing its trending results, and attracting the lionâ€™s share of mobile advertising revenues which many media organisations are competing for. The wording of the head of news job posting stops far short of suggesting Facebook is looking for someone to explicitly operate as an editor, something many in the industry have suggested is necessary but that the company has vigorously resisted. Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied that fake news on Facebook could have influenced the results of the US election, and while he has said the company would take steps to tackle the problem, he has warned that it should not be â€œarbiters of truth ourselvesâ€.

politifact15130,www.newsweek.com/president-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-nobel-peace-prize-north-korea-south-korea-905146,Could Trump Win The Nobel Peace Prize? Peace in Korean Peninsula Would Be Significant Foreign Policy Achievement,"When three   veterans were killed in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan in October, it barely created a ripple. So dominant has Isis become in the realm of jihadist lore, that you could be forgiven for thinking that its precursor has been relegated to a mere footnote. Youâ€™d be wrong. Those three deaths, all in US airstrikes, paradoxically hint at a resurgence of   at a time when Isis is in retreat in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Quietly, and more through soft power rather than harsh atrocity,   is trying to mount a revival.  The Pentagon said that at least one of the three leaders killed, Haydar Kirkan, a   veteran of the group, had been actively planning attacks against the west at the time of his death. This is a controversial claim as   founded in 1988, has in recent years foresworn such   operations in favour of a strategy privileging a slow and steady building of influence and capability at a local level within the Islamic world.  In part, this decision  â€”   taken by Ayman   the leader of   shortly after he succeeded the late Osama bin Laden in 2011  â€”   was forced on the group by its weakness after years of being targeted by the US and allies in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001.  But more recently it has been a deliberate attempt to distance it from Isis, which has been responsible for directly organised strikes in France, Belgium, Germany and Tunisia, among others, and  â€”   through   â€œlone wolvesâ€  â€”   in the US.    and its affiliates have deliberately shunned the savagery of Isis, seeking to build support across the Islamic world through outreach to tribal leaders, power brokers and sometimes the broader community, rather than outright fear and coercion.  The group does not seek publicity. â€œ â€™s strategic experience is that if it makes a big deal of seizing territory, it attracts CT [ ] resources, so it is simply not being as loud about it,â€ said Daveed   an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, a US thinktank. The three locations of the US strikes two months ago are significant. Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria are all key strategic zones where Isis has either failed to make significant advances or, in the latter case, is on the retreat.  In January 2015, Isis formally announced the establishment of what it called Khorasan province in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The move, coupled with an attempt to expand in Bangladesh, signified a push to branch out into south Asia and win recruits among the more than 400 million Muslims in the region. But the militants have had little success. â€œDespite its best efforts   â€¦     the Islamic State controls little territory in south Asia, [has] conducted only a handful of attacks, failed to secure the support of most locals, and struggled with poor leadership,â€ wrote Seth Jones, a former adviser to US forces in Afghanistan, this month. A major obstacle to the expansion of Isis in the region has been the opposition of most local militant groups, notably the Taliban.    which has preserved a close relationship with the Taliban and some other militant groups, is still present in Afghanistan. In October 2015, US and Afghan forces attacked a huge training compound in the south of the country, killing more than 200 militants. The camp was used by   in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) an affiliate established in 2014. South Asian officials point out that AQIS has so far failed to carry out any significant attacks or attract large numbers of recruits. However, that   had survived at all in the region was â€œimpressiveâ€ one said.  â€œThereâ€™s been constant pressure on the group, and particularly its leadership element, for 15 years, and theyâ€™re still there. The death of   is a blow, but theyâ€™ve suffered worse and still come back,â€ said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Another key battlefield has been Yemen, where, in perhaps the most striking unintended consequence of the   military intervention in the country,   was able to run a   on Yemenâ€™s coast for many months.  The substantial and strategically situated port city of Mukalla provided the group with a revenue of an estimated $2m a day. A 2015 US government report estimated that   in the Arabian peninsula (AQAP) the   affiliate, could muster at least 4, 000 fighters, four times the total a year previously. The group has also built ties with southern Yemenis, who have felt marginalised by the countryâ€™s northern elite for years. â€œWe may be facing a more complicated   not just a terrorist organisation, but a movement controlling territory with happy people inside it,â€ said a regional diplomat who follows Yemen.     has also successfully expanded its presence in Africa. The violence and brutality associated with the   Boko Haram group, which has now split over its nominal allegiance to Isis, and the Isis expansion into Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, have overshadowed the less spectacular but arguably more effective efforts made by   affiliates on the continent.  In Somalia, commanders of the   movement ruthlessly eliminated   factions that wanted to repudiate the groupâ€™s    allegiance to  . A last dissident group is currently under siege from Somali forces in the far north of Somalia, in   Puntland, and facing annihilation.  In the Sahel, although one new faction has emerged to launch attacks in the name of Isis, it is the coalition of factions that form   in the Maghreb (AQIM) that is dominant.   AQIM has exploited deep ties  â€”   some through marriage  â€”   with local communities and levered ethnic disputes to gain support and capabilities in Mali, a key state that French and other international forces have been unable to rid of extremists. â€œ  is on a trajectory to become by far the most powerful jihadist movement in Africa,â€ said  .  The most significant theatre may well turn out to be the Levant. Though most analysts believe Isis will remain a powerful  â€”   even if fragmented  â€”   force in the region for years to come,   may be the biggest winner.  The key to its strategy has been the   group now called Jabhat Fateh   (JFS). Formerly known as   Front, the powerful faction was rebranded in late July as a force without links to the global jihadi struggle but dedicated only to fighting Bashar  â€™s regime and its allies.  In recent years,   has repeatedly attempted to downplay its links to local groups to avoid alienating communities which do not want to be part of a â€œglobal jihadâ€ but which hope Islamic hardliners might impose order and honest, if rigorous, administration in areas they control.   Western officials fear JFS will not only dominate the jihadi landscape in the Levant following the defeat of Isis, but may also provide a springboard for   to launch strikes into Europe, should the group change its current strategy. Zawahiri has made it clear that although the group may have prioritised local campaigns for the moment, it still remains committed to attacks on the west in the long term. â€œAs the Islamic State continues to lose territory and as the international coalition continues targeted airstrikes, we are likely to see another name in the headlines more often: Jabhat Fateh â€ said Matthew Henman, of Janeâ€™s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. Hoffman described JFS as â€œeven more capable than the Islamic State and a more dangerous   threatâ€.",289,121,"972498001724887040	972498727540736007	972498730690674688	972498741960720384	972498854380785665	972498863637565441	972498905178038272	972501628376018944	972503394794565632	972510128850157568	972541407045992448	972545389457911809	972546397022011392	972550628412030977	972576615254208513	972617116011528193	972694074640748546	972694076213645312	972770487276396545	990919195906002945	994537686475137024	998638372359942145	1068794419820838913",fake

The extent of their raucous boozing and debauchery is being carefully catalogued inside the newly opened Nan A Rothschild Research Center, a repository in midtown Manhattan housing over one million archaeological artifacts from New York Cityâ€™s past. On a recent Thursday morning, Amanda Sutphin, the director of archaeology for the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission, sorted through some of her favorite City Hall party relics. She picked up a smooth, cylindrical object the size of stubby Cuban cigar. â€œTake a look at this douche,â€ said Sutphin, who is tall, with glasses and a short brown bob. â€œItâ€™s made of cow bone though, so it might have felt a bit rough. â€  The park behind City Hall, which was built in 1812, is by far the repositoryâ€™s largest haul  â€”   the city has collected over 400 boxes of artifacts from the site. A lot of them seem to be liquor bottles. â€œWhenever someone important would come to the city  â€”   like, say, Marquis de Lafayette  â€”   they would always throw a giant party. â€ Sutphin paused, still holding the douche. â€œBut Iâ€™m not saying this douche was found at Lafayetteâ€™s party!â€ The douche was uncovered in 2011, and caused enough of a stir that it was featured on a Saturday Night Live skit some years ago. â€œIt was just like, â€˜They found a douche behind City Hall, ooooo  â€¦    â€ A pause. â€œI never said it was funny. â€  Originally, no one could work out what it was  â€”   the archaeologist who found it thought it was a pepper grinder. â€œBut you can see here,â€  â€”   Sutphin unscrewed the top  â€”   â€œitâ€™s got a little plunger. And on the ends you can see the small holes. â€ It probably belonged to a young woman from the middle class  â€”   a more    society lady would have had a glass douche. â€œFor a smoother experience,â€ Sutphin said. Some women even used theirs as contraception, although, as Sutphin noted, â€œProbably wasnâ€™t very effective. â€ The repository is a small,   room in the basement of a Durst Organization building on West 47th Street. There are about 1, 5000 cardboard boxes  â€”   â€œarchival boxesâ€ is the technical term  â€”   filled with artifacts from 14 sites across the five boroughs, stacked neatly on white shelves. There are a lot of ceramics from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, remnants of the Revolutionary war (bayonets and buttons made by soldiers when it was too cold to go outside) and a lot of evidence of what people used to eat: bones  â€”   both cow and dog  â€”   and oysters as large as saucepans. This is because New York harbor in the 18th century was home to one of the largest oyster beds in the world the street carts that now sell hotdogs used to sell oysters in all varieties: raw, pickled, fried. â€œHaving an oyster back then would have been like having a nice steak,â€ Sutphin said.  Sutphin studied at Barnard College and has been with the Commission for 20 years. Her job is to review development projects happening throughout the city and figure out if there are any potential archaeological treasures to be found. â€œYou need to have a good grasp on the cityâ€™s history, particularly things like knowing where the early settlements were, what was farmland and what wasnâ€™t  â€”   and most importantly, where people dumped their trash. â€ The most common archaeological sites in the city are 19th century privies  â€”   toilets, in other words. Before New York City had public water, people used outhouses, with a separate cistern to store water. When public water was introduced, people began filling their outhouses with household trash. For Sutphin, colonial lavatories are about as exciting as it gets. â€œItâ€™s a time capsule of what that period is like. Sometimes you find incredible things: peopleâ€™s old dishes, their secret liquor stash. â€ Sutphinâ€™s job is rare: only a handful of other major US cities have archaeology programs, Boston and DC among them. â€œA lot of people think itâ€™s like Indiana Jones,â€ Sutphin said, somewhat annoyed. â€œItâ€™s not about finding some cool thing from the past that has magic powers  â€”   itâ€™s trying to recreate a puzzle of what the past was like. â€  Next to the City Hall party items, Sutphin had assembled a selection of the collectionâ€™s quirkier items: burned coffee beans  â€”   â€œCoffee was as important in the 19th century as it is now. Everyone drank it because the water was kind of shit back thenâ€  â€”   a femur from a passenger pigeon, which once ruled the skies above New York before being hunted into extinction some 100 years ago  â€”   â€œThey had bright, pretty feathers so everyone wanted someâ€  â€”   and a tea cup set belonging to the Van Cortlands, a wealthy family from the Bronx. Coincidentally, some of the items in the repository were until very recently stored inside the womenâ€™s restroom in Van Cortland park. â€œI do not know why or how the decision was made to store the collections there  â€”   but it was made many years ago and I think clearly shows the need for the repository both as a climate controlled facility and as a place that is managed by people who understand the importance of the collections,â€ Sutphin said. The only item in the collection associated with a particular individual is a wine jug seal belonging to Benjamin Fletcher, who was governor of New York from 1692 to 1697. (It was normal for wealthy people to send their own fancy glass jugs to taverns to be filled with wine.) Fletcher was a notorious lover of pirates, to the point where he allowed them safe passage in New York and as a result, was swiftly fired from his post and sent back to London, where he faced charges of conspiracy and bribery. â€œHe was a naughty boy,â€ Sutphin conceded. Although the repository is only open to researches and scholars, the Commission recently launched an online digital archive, where anyone can view images of the collection and read up on each artifactâ€™s backstory. Admittedly, these descriptions arenâ€™t very imaginative. â€œNuremberg single wire spectacles, small pieces of copper alloy wire tying the circular loops closed, probably Klemmerâ€™s clip, glass lenses missing. â€ In real life, the spectacles look like theyâ€™ve seen better days. Sutphin pulled them out of their box to show me. â€œI donâ€™t know how effective these would have been  â€”   maybe more effective than the douche?â€  She started to laugh, but stopped abruptly. â€œBut seriously,â€ she said, leaning in closer. â€œThe more stories we understand about our city the more people are represented, the richer we all are. Itâ€™s very much an   Trump view. â€",400,733,"924422736663011329	924774418714447872	924790271119904768	924800425223770112	924837478933999616	924863155364392960	924875248771645441	924883055860477953	924884266449715201	924927784518078465	924961700939485184	924971412728692736	924972910745399296	925031895922036741	925079933466001408	925084813979258886	925088019933167618	925089531967213568	925093719023472641	925187631117488128	925367130194874373	925424584349827072",fake

The game had begun under a barely concealed layer of concern over strikes and security fears, exacerbated by news of skirmishes involving England fans in Marseille, but Didier Deschampsâ€™s young France team eventually achieved   with a   victory over a dogged Romania. Afterwards, Payet said he had felt â€œa lot of stress, a lot of pressureâ€. â€œIf someone had told me it would have gone like that I wouldnâ€™t have believed it,â€ added the West Ham United forward. On the approach to the national stadium in   which was the target for three suicide bombers almost exactly seven months ago amid terrorist attacks on the capital that killed 130 people, home fans draped tricolors around their shoulders and donned novelty chicken hats, but the usual celebratory air was undercut by a mix of defiance and trepidation. Yet once inside, 75, 000 noisy fans waved thousands of French flags and a sizeable Romanian contingent responded in kind, forming a bold block of yellow at one end, as they tried to focus on the fact that a football tournament featuring 24 teams playing 51 matches across 10 stadiums was about to break out. All the accoutrements of a modern major sporting event were present and correct  â€”   the sponsorsâ€™ branding, the all but   stands, the painted faces and the garish wigs  â€”   but there was also an impatience to get under way and park the concerns of the buildup. Each new European Championship brings with it inflation  â€”   this time in its expansion to 24 teams and 2. 5 million fans  â€”   and that extended to the opening ceremony last night. DJ David Guetta, who the previous night had played a free concert for 80, 000 people under the Eiffel Tower, provided the music. French patrol planes flew overhead, 144   dancers in dresses emblazoned with the French flag cavorted around the pitch, an Eiffel Tower banner was unfurled and a 7. 5 sq km French garden overlay were all employed to try to create a party atmosphere in stark contrast to the ring of steel outside. But earlier, at least one metro train was evacuated as a precaution and the stadium was cleared in   to allow police with sniffer dogs to sweep through before the arrival of the French president, FranÃ§ois Hollande. He had also been present on the night of the attacks in November when France faced Germany, and it was when he left his seat in the VIP area that night that many of those present in the stadium knew something serious had happened. A huge security operation is under way across the country, with 90, 000 police, army and security staff responding to the heightened threat level. A security force of at least 13, 000 is on duty in the capital alone. Organisers had pleaded with fans to arrive up to three hours before   opening the gates early and promising entertainment within the stadiums, but strikes that have frustrated ministers and left rubbish piling up in central Paris also affected trains to the Stade de France. When the action on the pitch finally started, a swashbuckling France took the game to Romania but failed to puncture their gutsy defence before   as the crowd began again to get edgy.  Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud gave the hosts the lead shortly before the hour mark but Romania levelled from the penalty spot, before Payet stepped up to arrow his shot into the top corner and

politifact15004,http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/,"NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is ‘Rigged’, Found Dead","It was a bedraggled summer afternoon more than a decade ago. I was strolling down the street with my two young daughters. Lucy, the preschooler, was whirling around ahead of me, seemingly determined to fall on her face, while Beatrice, the baby, was squirming and giving me back strain in the baby carrier. I had not experienced a solid five hours of sleep in months. I had mastitis, so I was wearing cabbage leaves in my bra. Because I lived in a beautiful, gentrifying neighborhood that was still populated with a sprinkling of wise   I daily had some stranger approach me and sagely advise, â€œEnjoy it now. It goes by so fast. â€  But on this day, as I nodded gently in fake gratitude to the tip, I made a promise to myself. Iâ€™ll try to enjoy it, I thought. And I will never, ever say that to another parent. I will remember that it doesnâ€™t go by so fast when youâ€™ve been up since 4:30. I will remember that not all of this is very enjoyable at all. Now, that daredevil preschooler is a    high school junior with a packed social schedule. The baby who kept me up nights is a middle schooler who could, if   were an Olympic event, be a gold medalist. Sometimes I look at them and wistfully realize that they will never again fall asleep in my lap as I read them Goodnight Moon. I will never hear them hilariously mispronounce â€œelevatorâ€ or â€œambulanceâ€. I will not push them on swings, or feed them applesauce as we watch Sesame Street together. That door is closed.  I feel remarkably OK about that. Exhausted, overwhelmed parents of young children, let me assure you that, yes, this time in your childrenâ€™s lives is precious and beautiful and intimate and full of magic and discovery. But no, you do not need anybody to chide you into appreciating it. Iâ€™m sure you already do. Iâ€™m also sure you sometimes canâ€™t even imagine a barefoot walk across the living room floor that doesnâ€™t end in a   howl of pain. Iâ€™m sure the last five movies you saw involved talking animals. Iâ€™m sure the idea of a trip to the bathroom for yourself with nobody banging on the other side of the door sounds like a vacation in a four star hotel.  Well guess what? That uninterrupted bathroom break will come. And it wonâ€™t be sad. Itâ€™ll be awesome.  Recently, a friend came in from out of town for business, and do you know what we did? We met up for drinks. At 4pm. My purse has zero Cheerio dust in it. I havenâ€™t heard the Kidz Bop version of a contemporary pop song in a good three years. Sometimes, on the weekend, I sleep past 8am.  It helps very much that I happen to think my daughters have grown up to be pretty great people. They donâ€™t need me to tie their shoes, but they can make dinner. They donâ€™t make me pipe cleaner art, but they can talk about politics and movies and books theyâ€™ve read. They are interesting, engaged young women I like as individuals as much as I love them as my flesh and blood. That cuddly puppy phase of their lives was uniquely sweet, but seeing smart, independent young people launching into the world? Thatâ€™s sweet too. I think when people get inordinately nostalgic for their childrenâ€™s youths, theyâ€™re really being nostalgic for their own. Iâ€™d be lying if I said I didnâ€™t miss that young mom version of myself, the one with fewer lines on her face and flawless eyesight. I know that I associate my girlsâ€™ babyhood with a period of my own life, before a marital crisis and two bouts of cancer and the death of my best friend.  But I also remember how grateful I was when a friendâ€™s parent lovingly told me, when my kids were little: â€œThese are hard years. â€ So I try to hang on to the truth of that time, of what it was like when I couldnâ€™t just take a shower when I wanted, when an     tantrum could mean a child lying prone in the middle of the supermarket, making a spectacular scene. Sometimes when I see another parent whose kid is losing it in public, I just want to go over and reassure: â€œIt gets better. â€  There are so many joys of having older children, and of being older oneself. Believe it. Donâ€™t let anybody arrogantly make you feel like youâ€™re not stopping to smell the roses enough when youâ€™ve spent your day wiping noses instead.

Though the formal talks, which began last month, appeared to have led to the release of a handful of detained activists, hopes for real rapprochement were always slim. The two sides are fundamentally at loggerheads, with the opposition seeking to oust the socialist president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, while authorities vow he will not leave office before his term ends in 2019.  â€œThe government, in an irresponsible manner, froze the dialogue process by not showing up to two technical meetings last night,â€ opposition coalition leader JesÃºs Torrealba told Reuters.  Opposition activists said authorities backed away after the national assembly on Tuesday held a heated session in which they slammed Maduro over a drug scandal.  Two nephews of Maduroâ€™s wife were found guilty this month on charges in the US that they tried to carry out a   drug deal to help their family stay in power.  â€œThe government is using the debate as an excuse,â€ said   presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, accusing authorities of not being committed to talks.  â€œThe government has not complied with any of its promises. They promised to free political prisoners there are more than 100 imprisoned. They promised [to open] a humanitarian channel not a single medicine has come in. â€  The information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  It was not clear if the talks could be revived or if the opposition would resume a more militant agenda, which before the talks included protests and putting Maduro on trial before the national assembly.  Mediators appeared to be trying to save the talks. Spainâ€™s   minister JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero and US diplomat Thomas Shannon were holding or seeking meetings with both sides.  Dialogue had divided the diverse opposition coalition, with some activists feeling the government was duping the opposition to buy time. Previous   also showed little progress. The situation in   Venezuela has worsened in the past few months, with a recession leaving millions unable to find or afford food amid shortages and soaring inflation.  The opposition blames Maduro, who is unpopular, and has been vying to remove him via a recall referendum. The former bus driver and union leader, however, has said the opposition is actually seeking a coup against him and has vowed to see out his term.

Weâ€™d been there for about 10 minutes when there was a knock on the window. It was a police officer. Someone had reported the presence of two suspicious men in a vehicle. As we drove off, my dad chuckled at the idea that anyone could think of us, a   man and his son in a Volvo estate, as a threat. I laughed too, but I wouldnâ€™t have if Iâ€™d realised that incidents like this were soon to become commonplace. Here, in 1984, was an end to boyhood and the start of my journey into adulthood  â€”   into becoming a black man. What this meant in practice was that my body was no longer my own. Being a black man means being subject to the white gaze. It means becoming an object of prejudice and fascination, simultaneously hypervisible and invisible to white society, your emotions and inner life ignored. The tropes are familiar and still potent: black men as supernaturally gifted at sports and entertainment, in possession of hulking bodies and ungovernable sexuality, liable to lapse into violence and lawlessness. When I walk down the street, the sense of being scrutinised and judged and typecast still is never far from my mind. Itâ€™s an uncomfortable feeling to live with. But, given the option, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d ever choose to surrender it. Through that awareness of how different, contradictory, perspectives can flourish simultaneously, great art can emerge art that puts black men at the centre of an image as nuanced subjects rather than stereotypes. Iâ€™ve attempted to explore these themes of identity, maleness, race and power in a new exhibition, Made You Look, at the Photographerâ€™s Gallery in London. The show examines how black men shape their   in front of the camera. It gathers work by artists including Malick Sidibe, celebrated for capturing the vibrant life of a newly independent Mali in the 1960s and 70s Samuel Fosso, who pictures himself in a variety of slyly amusing guises and assumed identities and Hassan Hajjaj, who photographed men meticulously dressed in vivid African prints against bright backgrounds of clashing colours. This is a time of marked gain and loss for black people. For while this is a period of unprecedented black prominence  â€”   from Barack Obama in the White House to artists such as BeyoncÃ©, Steve McQueen, Marlon James, Kanye West  â€”   black people are still victim to the consequences of entrenched racism. More than 500 black and   people in Britain have died in suspicious circumstances while in state detention over the past 25 years, without a single official being successfully prosecuted. In America, one in three black men can expect to go to jail at some point in their lives. And the list of   men killed in recent years solely because of their skin colour  â€”   Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Freddie Gray among them  â€”   continues to grow. Against this fragile backdrop, Made You Look focuses on the figure of the black dandy. Dandyism, defined as a man â€œunduly concerned with looking stylish and fashionableâ€ might seem like trivial concerns in the era of the Black Lives Matter campaign. But as the case of Trayvon Martin, shot by George Zimmerman for looking â€œsuspiciousâ€ in a hoodie, attests to the fact that how you dress can sometimes be the difference between life and death. Dandyism is also about using dress to flout conventional notions of class, taste, gender and sexuality  â€”   certainly the case with the majestically louche Soweto youth majestically decked out in flared sleeveless suits and pearls, shot by South African   Moolman, and the strikingly beautiful young man photographed in New York by Jeffrey Henson Scales. Such images point to the subversive power of dandyism to reveal masculinity itself as a performance, as something provisional, open to reinterpretation, rather than a set of inherited characteristics fixed in the skin. And they also highlight how, for black men, style is a form of radical personal politics. As a teenager, having to grapple for the first time with the force of the white gaze, Iâ€™d ask myself this question: how do you live without fear or debilitating anger in a world where youâ€™re constantly reminded that your body doesnâ€™t belong to you? The answer, as proposed by the works in this show, is to demand to be seen on your own terms, via the style and attitude that announces your ambitions and desires, your sense of pride and inner belief. For the most part, the men featured in the exhibition arenâ€™t wearing the finest of clothes. They seem less concerned with what they wear than how they wear it. Their style is by turns flamboyant, provocative, arresting, camp, playful and assertive. It is about confounding expectations about how black men should look or carry themselves in order to establish a place of personal freedom: a place beyond the white gaze, where the black body is a site of liberation rather than oppression. Made You Look is on display at the Photographerâ€™s Gallery in London from 15   September 2016.",155,897,"871504202153025536	871516797320790017	871577485741260800	871579815631040512	871714089986396161	871719436419465217	871738272636174340	871762816088387585	871765834129125377	871769412298305537	871808085546983424	871819122535002112	871822390661087233	871830354826584065	871862583489441792	871937160081002497	871989702131417089	872003782346891264	872044634012348416	872069503361929216	872083028385841153	872093697474785280	872093728776871937	872132102128640003	872133476593655808	872133889837461506	872140025676177409	872155306402357248	872189211755110402	872192657979621376	872203928070307840	872253041411575808	872295036670496768	872325688937902080	872354406418845698	872375365930553344	872428233479925760	872461353646030848	872461762427314176	872477760521986048	872482798975799297	872486181413539841	872489857842634752	872496950700118017	872501854952865795	872527793036316672	872556787601473538	872572181544402950	872590383733022720	872590622892453889	872590874395504640	872591386759102464	872592486195134467	872592734183239680	872593153978716161	872593394324951042	872593763813785600	872593925701124096	872594562136649728	872606417554898945	872625001878482944	872824464723116032	872870915851288577	872881942017982464	872883664522280960	872895466136121345	872934908351533056	872938374050578433	872973611715395584	872991268233764866	873047850975870977	873128802016047109	873169821478699008	873210398190837760	873244077571092481	873255190035648518	873299006365069314	873311864834334720	873325982937227264	873326045058838528	873546576970604546	873649619393228801	873660996455411714	873894958486491137	874112612174319616	874245791686172672	874824005173231616	894657314212335617",fake

MartÃ­nez was sacked on Thursday following a dismal run of results and performances that indicated the players had stopped responding to his methods. Southamptonâ€™s manager, Ronald Koeman, is the preferred replacement of Farhad Moshiri, Evertonâ€™s major shareholder, with Frank de Boer also under consideration. David Unsworth, Joe Royle and Duncan Ferguson will take charge of Evertonâ€™s final home game of the season against Norwich City on Sunday, when Howard will bring his distinguished decade with the club to an end. The USA international is to join Colorado Rapids in MLS on 1 July. Howard was on the bench for feeble away displays at Liverpool, Leicester City and Sunderland  â€”   when there were a total of 84 shots on the Everton goal  â€”   and denies witnessing a team that had stopped playing for their manager. â€œThat is a grenade that people throw and they duck and watch to see what happens. Itâ€™s a load of rubbish,â€ the Everton goalkeeper insisted. â€œThere is so much in the head of a footballer. You pull that shirt on, you run out on the pitch and the last thing that crosses your mind is: â€˜Hey, Iâ€™ve got an idea, Iâ€™m just going to strut around here because I am going to get the manager sacked. Letâ€™s do that.â€™ â€œI donâ€™t know how that works. I donâ€™t think anyone thinks like that individually. We donâ€™t sit around in the dressing room and have a   that we are all going to down tools. I donâ€™t really know where that comes from. â€ MartÃ­nez repeatedly denied that a squad he labelled the strongest of his tenure had underachieved this season. Everton are 12th in the Premier League and have recorded the lowest points total at home since the introduction of three points for a win in 1981. Howard said: â€œI think we have underachieved this season. The players have probably let ourselves down. Any time a manager loses his job, they canâ€™t replace 22 of us, which is probably unfortunate for them. It is always the manager who ends up suffering. Roberto has not kicked a ball all season. That is down to us. The results have not been good enough for the talent we have and the squad. That is no secret. â€œEveryone needs a bit of luck. We have a fantastic squad here that keeps getting talked about. We are going to finish   or just below. We have no   right to do anything or finish higher. We have to earn that right. This team is good enough to compete near the top and if it has been a disappointing year then so be it. â€œThe foundation is there. The next manager that comes in will be delighted to see some of the faces here at his disposal and to be able to mould that team, play the way he wants to. He will be sitting on a goldmine. â€ The    will make his 414th and final Everton appearance on Sunday, having decided against staying at Goodison Park until his contract expires in 2018. Howard had a few   with supporters before losing his place to Joel Robles midway through the season but insists the exchanges played no part in his decision to return to the US. â€œI was irritated that we werenâ€™t playing well,â€ he said. â€œI love the supporters here. They get pissed off when we lose, I get pissed off when we lose. I never go home happy when we lose. It is no different. Someone has something to say to me that is   then I say something back even if it is at the grocery store or at Goodison. There wasnâ€™t any spat. They were pissed off we werenâ€™t playing well and so was I. â€œThat didnâ€™t influence my thinking about the future. My plan was always to see out my contract  â€”   I love this club. As we know this is a business and it is a tough business sometimes. I have two young children, I wanted to have an opportunity leading up to the World Cup to be in the shop window right in front of my [international] manager every week. â€œFrom a contractual stand point, Colorado offered me another year and a half on the back of my contract. Those are all real things. People talk about footballers being robots but this is all real life. If that was offered to my dad in the truck yard he would probably take it because it makes sense. Ten years seemed like the right time. I will always be an Evertonian but this just seemed like the right time. â€",45,347,"983225226371698688	983539473718771712	983617907618918402",fake
politifact14940,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/full-text-jeff-flake-on-trump-speech-transcript-343246,Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcript,"The    home of Josiah Bartlett, a New Hampshire doctor who signed the Declaration of Independence after John Hancock and later became governor, is still available two years after it was put up for sale by his     granddaughter. Bartlett is also the fictional ancestor of one of Americaâ€™s greatest fictional presidents, Josiah Bartlet, who was played by Martin Sheen in the   TV hit The West Wing. His actual descendant, Ruth Albert, has spent much of her life in the house in the town of Kingston. Now 65, she wants to downsize. Albert has no children, however, and she has exhausted her list of cousins. Last year, she was approached by a fellow   Bartlett who lives in Florida, but that didnâ€™t work out. â€œI held on and held on,â€ the retired postal worker said, adding that the Florida descendant was considering moving to New Hampshire to pursue a doctorate.  â€œI guess at one point in time, she was thinking it would be kind of cool to go to Dartmouth, because thatâ€™s where a lot of our ancestors got their doctorate degrees. And then I think she decided it was just a little too cold up there. â€ Albert took the property, about 10 miles from Massachusetts, off the market for the winter and advertised it again this spring. The      colonial farmhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is selling for $549, 900. It has a linden tree that Bartlett brought back from Philadelphia as a sapling after signing the Declaration of Independence. Little has changed beyond kitchen and bathroom renovations and mechanical upgrades. Bartlettâ€™s medical instruments are displayed in the parlor. One end of the second floor still has an outhouse and tin bathtub with a pump. Additional land near the house can be bought, bringing the price to $849, 900. â€œPeople have been coming to look at it, but I havenâ€™t had any serious offers,â€ Albert said. Ben Wilson, director of New Hampshireâ€™s Bureau of Historic Sites, said the state could not afford to buy and operate the house without an endowment. â€œHistoric buildings, landscapes and monuments take an extra level of care, so the bureau tries very hard to make the most of the resources it has,â€ he said.  â€œTaking on a new property that is not endowed would place an extra burden on the services and experiences we currently provide to our thousands of visitors. â€ Plan New Hampshire, a group that evaluates communitiesâ€™ strengths, said the house was â€œuniquely important to the town, the state and the countryâ€ and that it could be used as a restaurant, brewery or bed and breakfast. Bartlett was born in Amesbury, Massachusetts in 1729. He moved to Kingston in 1750 to set up practice. He married his cousin Mary Bartlett, and they had 12 children. He died in 1795. One of his sons, Dr Levi Bartlett, lived in the house, and it has stayed in the family since.",653,366,"922909748890128384	922912974079188992	922920993047244800	922921690220204032	922921756184023042	922922362424631296	922922430070325250	922922461825449986	922922466665644034	922922463565983744	922922923962150912	922923311373328384	922923358605361152	922923379480342528	922923556572356608	922924349874585600	922924820039311360	922924930068447233	922926858466869249	922926864838156289	922929220095004672	922929476727603200	922929518121291779	922929769305559040	922931021292670977	922931104109289473	922931317964263425	922931457017958400	922931463254958081	922931499380461569	922931855069814784	922931858844913664	922932082573275136	922932246977400832	922933278709043200	922933436440080384	922933824090181632	922934043431272448	922934340966932480	922936361757192193	922936691261833223	922936764221837312	922937931257479169	922938370086510592	922938460784095232	922940090510278656	922941583296643072	922942385641865216	922942820637437952	922948730357084160	922949486774808579	922949561991151616	922949670543949824	922949737816514569	922949959401422849	922950208287330306	922951810612105216	922952042217340929	922952360644681728	922952493226647552	922952559630934022	922959135158743040	922959655265021952	922960991071145989	922964715764178944	922964953539186689	922965629816246273	922965695775805446	922965984251731968	922966120528785411	922966594677981184	922966606019473409	922966899125780484	922967064423354369	922968330071355392	922968662926962688	922969125349048320	922970598816411648	922973775880228864	922974541101461504	922974705589653510	922974704700342272	922974923475378176	922975468822908928	922978687787683845	922978749892714496	922978777000546304	922981448747028480	922982499558424576	922983557827571712	922984162138525696	922984477042888704	922987965952950272	922991261287636997	922991302756786177	922993152562167809	922994439320059905	922995003709734912	922995852620087296	922998131758739457	922998303037341696	923000913416957954	923001150902697984	923005435161935872	923006092946284544	923009373630291968	923009541062590464	923013340162428929	923015416951263232	923016515162726401	923018143261270016	923020946889494533	923021311999438848	923021466748309505	923021868671684610	923025827671019523	923061217983434752	923064735511252992	923066001696141312	923067983831875585	923076319239385088	923078347940298752	923120633030107136	923133374645940225	923154444958679040	923155460982747136	923166449635614720	923167019926728704	923170751863246848	923178906420617216	923180663422951424	923200199539019776	923208825506877440	923225857400897536	923236506235367424	923239182637715457	923266411090366464	923286277293793282	923312622723829760	923373414362091522	923434071979692032	923500561940480000	923515979191250945	923725667845443589	924341701547720704	953665570217648128	953681816698998789	953683683671789568	953683985384853505	953685491618123776	953686544644272132	953687403864231937	953687853065793538	953688937943519232	953694911022403584	953697391269392384	953697491786125312	953704356368576512	953704356238495744	953713190189363200	953716730483953666	953846959080660993	969456362450247680	999509818112167937	1017082169179672576",fake
politifact13687,http://politicot.com/mike-pence-allowing-rape-victims-abortions-will-lead-women-trying-get-raped/,Mike Pence: “Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped”,"Las Vegas is due to witness its most surreal showdown since Mike Tyson repeatedly bit Evander Holyfieldâ€™s ear in the middle of a heavyweight boxing match, as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off in the third and final debate before the presidential election. For Trump, Wednesday nightâ€™s debate may be the last opportunity to salvage the dwindling support that in recent weeks has seemingly placed the election increasingly out of the Republican nomineeâ€™s reach. The encounter at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, comes as both campaigns are beset by controversy in the final stretch of the most unusual presidential campaign in modern history. Clinton has been forced to contend with the illegal hacking of her campaign chairmanâ€™s emails, leaked in tranches by WikiLeaks in what the US government has described as the work of Russian intelligence.  Trump has faced even greater obstacles, stemming from an unearthed tape in which he boasted of groping women without their consent that prompted a number of women to come forward with accusations of sexual assault against the real estate mogul over a nearly   period. The debate, moderated by Fox Newsâ€™ Chris Wallace, will focus on six topics: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president. But as in the last two debates between Trump and Clinton, policy is expected to take a back seat to the unpredictable behaviour associated with Trump. The former reality TV star, who has spent the past week darkly warning of voter fraud, has one more chance to try to staunch his leaking support in the polls. Polling aggregator Real Clear Politics shows Clinton with an average lead of almost seven points in recent polls, a lead comparable to that of Barack Obama over John McCain at a similar point in the 2008 election. Even deeply Republican states such as Alaska, Utah and Texas are within the margin of error in some surveys and the Clinton campaign, buoyed by its momentum, is now investing in conservative battlegrounds that include Arizona, Indiana and Missouri. Clinton has maintained a tradition of burying herself in debate preparation in recent days, thus keeping a lighter footprint on the campaign trail. Trump, by contrast, has been notoriously averse to readying himself for the debates and has suffered through two below par performances. Even so, the Republican nominee mocked Clinton at a Colorado rally on Tuesday as â€œrestingâ€. â€œItâ€™s lying down and going to sleep,â€ Trump said, taking another veiled jab at Clintonâ€™s health despite records disclosed by the former secretary of state last month showing no significant medical issues. Clintonâ€™s campaign said her focus would remain on policy in the debate regardless of Trumpâ€™s efforts to rattle her with criticisms intended for a base that routinely engages in chants of â€œLock her upâ€ at his rallies. â€œWhat we have seen is that when she does do that, the character of Hillary Clinton thatâ€™s revealed to voters is someone that is quite capable of standing up to him and defending American values and reaffirming them,â€ Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for Clintonâ€™s campaign, told reporters on Tuesday. â€œWe know that [Trump] thought that strategy of scorched earth would depress our vote but, if anything, we have found that itâ€™s helped to motivate our voters. â€ Trump, having shown himself to be lacking in substance on the issues, will have to rely on his improvisational style to carry him through the   encounter. But Wednesday night will mark the first time Trump will be questioned before a national audience of this scale about the sexual assault allegations against him, as well as his baseless claims of voter fraud to assert that the election is â€œriggedâ€. Several   Republicans have refuted Trumpâ€™s claim of illicit activity at the ballot box. Palmieri did not say if Clinton would address the matter at the debate, stating instead that the campaign was â€œconfident in the electionâ€. â€œWe understand the strategy that he is trying to do to explain his loss and also to try to deter voters,â€ she said, â€œ[but] we believe that itâ€™s going to be easier to vote than ever before. â€ While most of those on the Las Vegas Strip were busy milling between slot machines and Blackjack tables on the eve of the debate, many acknowledged the gambling would come to a halt on Wednesday evening. The election, several people said, was simply too captivating. Javier Solano, of Yuma, Arizona, said he was on holiday but would not miss the final event. â€œI donâ€™t know what to expect from Trump,â€ he said, â€œbut he isnâ€™t a candidate fit to be president. â€ Solano, who said he was voting for Clinton, had some advice for Trumpâ€™s supporters: â€œYou canâ€™t just be angry. You have to make the right choice, thinking not just about what affects you but what affects everyone. â€ Joe Jessome, of Ontario, Canada, was in town for a conference but also planned to watch the debate. Jessome, who said his American wife and two children planned to cast their ballots for Trump, expects a more â€œbalancedâ€ debate under the helm of Fox News. â€œI think the moderators are really biased toward the Democrats and Hillary Clinton,â€ he said. â€œ[Although] Donald Trump speaks before he thinks a lot of the time and made lewd comments 11 years ago   â€¦     itâ€™s more about the economy and whatâ€™s going on in the world. Hillary Clinton, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, is â€˜Crooked Hillaryâ€™. â€ Brandon Davis, a Trump supporter from California, agreed. â€œEveryoneâ€™s been against him from the beginning,â€ he said, while noting Clinton had â€œa lot of baggageâ€. While the debates have been marked by a bitterness bordering on contempt, Clinton and Trump will meet again at a decidedly more   venue on Thursday. Both candidates are scheduled to attend the Alfred E Smith dinner, an annual fundraiser for Catholic charities in New York, less than 24 hours after they share the debate stage.

politifact14305,http://politicot.com/paul-ryan-22-million-americans-choose-poor-problem-cant-afford-healthy/,"Paul Ryan: “22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It’s Their Own Problem If They Can’t Afford To Be Healthy”","This past Thursday was Thanksgiving. A time when we remember a feast, the first Thanksgiving, on Plymouth plantation in the autumn of 1621. The tales of pilgrims from the Mayflower who celebrated the harvest, shared and broke bread with the first Americans, are still used as inspiration and shared with children, teaching them the beauty of gratitude. But it is now widely understood this Thanksgiving story is a fictional history. It was invented to whitewash the vicious genocide wrought upon the native inhabitants of this magnificent continent. Not only did the Europeans try to eradicate native populations, but they made every effort to eviscerate their culture, their language and eliminate them from these coveted lands. From Plymouth Rock to Standing Rock, this lie has made our Thanksgiving Day a day of mourning for the First Nations, all the tribes big and small, those who came before us. A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux In North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over 500 tribes and thousands of others standing on the frontlines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. The camp grows as winter comes. Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty. Everyone we talk with is committed to peaceful resistance. Weapons, alcohol and drugs are forbidden there. Standing together in prayer to protect water displays a deeply rooted awareness of lifeâ€™s interconnected nature, and of the intrinsic value and import of traditional ways. This growing movement stems from love, it is the most human instinct to protect that which we love. An eager and engaged youth are at the core of this pipeline route resistance, learning from a population of elders who pass down unforgotten knowledge.  It is an awakening. All here together, with their   relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and national guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, above all other expressed concerns. They stand against corporate security forces, the county sheriff and the national guard. Standing while being hit with water cannons, mace, teargas, rubber bullets. Standing without weapons and praying, the water protectors endure human rights abuses in freezing temperatures. Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world, that an American corporate media is not free to report. Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. But they stand, their hair frozen from water cannons. They stand for all that is good and they stay strong. We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately.  We will be going back to support the water protectors again.  Let us all stand with them in thanks, in appreciation for the ancient wisdom they carry, in thanks for this opportunity for true gratitude. For giving us a path forward. For trying to show us a road to survival. We offer our support and our respect. We hear the call to protect the water protectors to listen, learn and get engaged. They are brave. We thank them. And we can give thanks for the bounty. Like water on the garden of activism, Americaâ€™s surprise president brings a bounty of opportunity. The great issues of our time are now brightly illuminated and people are becoming more aware of them than ever, from sea to shining sea, from Standing Rock to Wall Street. The surprise   was not the winner of the popular vote, does not have a mandate for the change of ideals envisioned. Keep in mind, close to over two million more people voted for another candidate. Nor is the surprise president the leader of the free world. Two hundred of the worldâ€™s nations believe in science, above the profits of the oil, gas and coal industries, and are committed to working together to protect the future from an unchecked climate crisis. The surprise president claims he does not believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways. Do not be intimidated by the surprise presidentâ€™s cabinet appointees as they descend the golden escalator. Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders. The golden tower is not yours. The White House is your house.  Your growing activism in support of freedom over repression, addressing climate change, swiftly replacing a destructive old industries with safe, regenerative energy, encouraging holistic thinking in balance with the future of our planet that activism will strengthen and shed continued light on us all. These worthy goals must be met for all the worldâ€™s children and theirs after them.  This is our moment for truth.  Unintimidated, stand, speak up and show up. Be counted. Be like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock. Be there if you can. The progress we have made over 240 years as a nation, has always come first from the people.  Thank you, Neil Young and Daryl Hannah",52,404,,fake

Beckham, who ran afoul of the NFLâ€™s   uniform policy even though he wore them only during   and not Sundayâ€™s   win over the Detroit Lions, went on to accuse the NFL of a double standard when Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott was spared a fine after jumping into an oversize Salvation Army kettle to celebrate a touchdown. â€œI got fined 18k for Craig Sager cleats that were auction off the cleats to the highest bidder and donating the proceeds to his cancer research,â€ Beckham wrote on Wednesday in an Instagram post. â€œ18k like itâ€™s nothing to them, no warning to take them off or anything noTHING!â€ The remarks were in response to a post by Washington wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who was apparently also fined by the league for cleats that failed to conform to the leagueâ€™s tightly enforced standards. Beckham, who is in the third year of a   $10. 4m contract and will earn a base salary of $1. 36m this season, was selected to his third Pro Bowl this week after overcoming a slow start to the 2016 campaign.",767,861,"993149717159841792	993219452635361282	993219488408588293	993219502073630720	993220540847583232	993225474510901250	993226784870207489	993229239548858372	993232439031017473	993233616133066752	993245460142968832	993253544852643845	993258874730893312	993283585665744896	993318916939231233	993474863418560512	993501357289213953	993718769724936193	993830626930364416	993853016099799041	993863464010559488	993866429802860544	993874979585392641	993895284362035200	993935012683710464	993956315373490178	993970515009261568	993997333112254469	994000904696328192	994011148537167872	994011487877451776	994019285163913216	994022316400107520	994026981430882305	994027239565033472	994072928789712899	994079883985813504	994082731150790656	994091645556678656	994104142175133696	994120901812719616	994151338068983808	994157490530111488	994168591116328961	994193071293325312	994196158087073792	994214329271582721	994215923291738113	994222267604373504	994226366215327744	994250168034873344	994256804677799936	994257160258322433	994262504355323904	994265224747208704	994268084084051968	994271243661598722	994271835821887489	994273590995488768	994275531200712704	994275538771443713	994275540847681536	994276601910067200	994281698971062277	994290622663028736	994298778650849280	994308277054951424	994315602310418434	994343238009065472	994347416995450887	994348289804898304	994351326166478849	994373255850012672	994373532376236032	994378540593315841	994391881827135488	994398166962368512	994403542051033088	994413828472438784	994454024278626304	994465350799515648	994481118832312320	994530782403334144	994550532000964613	994557099664429057	994563572293251073	994568144936108032	994583145323352065	994597733926400000	994613733711228928	994675860656533505	994684038538444800	994726422857084929	994734608204861442	994791071183003648	994791717013422082	994953425266925568	994957015985291264	995003446511243266	995138583907524608	995170894984241153	995452774627209216	995510054076985344	995535500176916481	995536932678635521	995782581370011648	995822474720931841	995870295784275968	996836700914626560	999036224668041216	999077114010898432	1000830085405044736	1003998110958354432	1007218789178585089	1007478132306259968	1008108012517625856	1008436106973630465	1008727124193116161	1009076718685089793	1009386776308224000	1009526761007116288	1010010025035816960	1010993703605981184	1011401574017617920	1012302012422205441	1012661847470768134	1012793997411090435	1012982859215196160	1013222401386086400	1013223356496216065	1013408677624188929	1013772004158332928	1013893753332031494	1014194321585790977	1014255172552417281	1014255293008678913	1014255748476358657	1014255911030984704	1014257001130545153	1014261909820932096	1014278845913092096	1014505239888781312	1014635703790198784	1014856093166645248	1014868286784274432	1014953413740810241	1015002925389832192	1015097389928124416	1015266254263930881	1015373644070096896	1015632878116442112	1015782274359595008	1015802451402817536	1016123072007540736	1016137759948451840	1016309633881759744	1016373301915017217	1016408008455282688	1016467109939998721	1016479006206648320	1017240704915947520	1017972635878285312	1018605554460225536	1019586902742183936	1019678147716046849	1020053563169476612	1023192265903271938	1024674961364078592	1026798589048172545	1027974252404912130	1028105525580517376	1028695269704065024	1029082950145638402	1032241640738566144	1032482142981369856	1032666920997269504	1034759071155544064	1034891401014571009	1036830996371521537	1036959373090807809	1037150432878112768	1037479262213873664	1037700577499729921	1040294416865476608",fake

politifact13887,http://www.newslo.com/price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/,Tom Price: “It’s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly”,"Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome at the White House on Thursday as the   met Barack Obama for a   private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first stage of a   transition process between Tuesdayâ€™s unexpected election victory and Trumpâ€™s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men discussed â€œforeign and domestic policyâ€ and how to ensure the handover of power went smoothly. â€œI want to emphasise to you, Mr   that we now are going to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,â€ Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity afterwards. A grinning Trump gave Obama a pat on the back as they got up to leave, and boasted to reporters of how long he had just spent in the Oval Office, though the president  â€”   more   until then  â€”   jokingly advised him not to take any questions. While they spoke, Trumpâ€™s wife Melania was shown around their new home in the official residence and East Wing by Michelle Obama, reportedly discussing what it was like to raise children in the White House.  Trump appeared to relish the welcome, though White House officials did not allow photographs of the traditional greeting outside. Obama appeared stiff and subdued throughout. â€œThis was a meeting that was going to last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and we were just going to get to know each other,â€ said Trump in the brief remarks to reporters he gave from an ornate armchair usually occupied by world leaders.  â€œWe had never met each other. I have great respect. The meeting lasted for almost an hour and a half. And it could have  â€”   as far as Iâ€™m concerned, it could have gone on for a lot longer. â€ Asked if he would seek advice from Obama in the future, despite intense criticism from both of them toward the other in the past, Trump described his political opponent as a â€œvery good manâ€. â€œWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties,â€ said the   according to the official White House transcript of their remarks. â€œI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. He explained some of the difficulties, some of the   assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved. â€ Briefing reporters afterwards, press secretary Josh Earnest said he did not know what Trump had meant by â€œ  assetsâ€ and denied the Republicanâ€™s claim that only 10 minutes had originally been scheduled. But he insisted the meeting was â€œa little less awkward than some might have expectedâ€ and tried to explain Obamaâ€™s comment that the meeting had been â€œexcellentâ€. â€œWhen you consider the profound differences between the two gentlemen and the fact they have never met before . .. I think that qualifies as â€˜excellentâ€™,â€ said Earnest. Washington has quickly adopted a deferential approach toward the future    despite widespread demonstrations in major US cities since Tuesdayâ€™s election and reports of an increase in racist attacks aimed at immigrants. As votes from California and other   states on the west coast were slowly processed on Thursday, Clinton was on track to exceed Trumpâ€™s share of the popular vote by 1. 2% fueling concern about the mandate for sweeping change.  Yet there were no protests visible outside the White House in the hour leading up to Trumpâ€™s arrival. One woman with a placard saying â€œstand up to racismâ€ laid it on the ground as she was interviewed by a succession of media crews, though other protesters were expected during the meeting. Instead, the traditional Marine guard stood stiffly outside the West Wing as Trumpâ€™s motorcade swept in from Ronald Reagan airport, where he left his trademark Boeing  . The US Secret Service has announced a temporary   zone for commercial aircraft over Trump Tower in New York, where the   will continue to live for the next few weeks. Trumpâ€™s motorcade arrived on the South Lawn at the White House, which is not visible to journalists or the public. He also refused to allow the usual presence of a pooled media representative with him as he travelled. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump would travel back to New York on Thursday night. In a sharp change of tone, much of the US news media has treated Trump with the respectful approach usually granted to the US head of state when performing ceremonial duties, referring to the   informally as PEOTUS. During the Oval Office meeting, Ivanka Trumpâ€™s husband Jared Kushner  â€”   a likely top aide in the next administration  â€”   was escorted through the Rose Garden by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough.    Joe Biden was due to meet with his successor, Mike Pence, while Trump headed to meet Republican congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill. They have pledged to give him full support in repealing key Democratic legislation such as Obamacare and international climate change accords. Trumpâ€™s election win has already ignited protests across the US, with thousands of demonstrators crowding into streets and surrounding his buildings in major American cities during the first night after the result. The protests  â€”   in cities including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia and Seattle  â€”   erupted after the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, lost the electoral college and presidential race on Tuesday night despite almost certainly winning the popular vote. As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue and marched by Trump Tower, carrying signs that read â€œNot my presidentâ€ â€œShe got more votesâ€ and â€œHands off my pussyâ€ a reference to a leaked recording where Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because of his fame. A number of arrests were made. Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square  â€”   35 blocks downtown  â€”   continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of the  â€™s building. Behind the scenes there is also a bleak mood among many Democrats in the outgoing administration, but officially it has decided to emphasise small signs of progress in the tone adopted by Trump since his victory. â€œI have been very encouraged by the, I think, interest in   Trumpâ€™s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces,â€ said Obama. â€œAnd I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face. â€ The two also had specific conversations about how Obama would handle discussions with foreign leaders on an upcoming overseas trip. They also discussed ways of organising an effective team around the new president to handle future crises. â€œThey spent a large portion of the meeting discussing the importance of properly staffing and organising a White House,â€ Earnest, the press secretary, told reporters after the meeting. He declined to answer questions about whether they discussed Trumpâ€™s promise to unwind much of the outgoing administrationâ€™s achievements over the last eight years. â€œPresident Obama came away from the meeting with renewed confidence in the commitment of the   to ensure a smooth transition,â€ said Earnest. No staff were in the room during the meeting, but Earnest stressed it was unrealistic to expect the meeting to smooth over all that had gone beforehand. â€œI feel confident in telling you that they did not resolve all of their differences, but I also feel confident in telling you that they did not try to resolve all of their differences. â€ He said he was not aware of any additional meeting that has been scheduled but â€œwouldnâ€™t rule out anythingâ€ after Trump spoke of wanting to hear Obamaâ€™s counsel. It is thought the meeting in Washington on Thursday was the only time they have been in same room since Obama ridiculed Trumpâ€™s claims about his birthplace at a White House correspondentsâ€™ dinner in 2011.

politifact15262,https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/,Breaking: Greitens Accuser Admits Photo Session May Have Been A “Dream”,"There seems to be some truth in the old saying that the third timeâ€™s the charm, at least when it comes to Philadelphiaâ€™s passage of a soda tax. After two previous attempts failed, on 16 June Philadelphiaâ€™s city council voted to pass a tax of 1. 5 cents per ounce on both regular and diet soda beverages.  Soda sales and their impact on the epidemic of obesity are a hot topic across the US, and much of the world. Philadelphia is the   city in the US and the largest to successfully pass such a proposal. Only tiny, liberal bastion Berkeley, California, had passed a plan until last week. Since 2008, some 43 other taxes have been proposed in cities and municipalities and all have failed, faced down by the powerful drinksâ€™ lobby. Soda sales are declining  â€”   in the US they soon look set to be outstripped by sales of bottled water. But still 17% of Americans drink soda at least once every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And consumption is higher among black and Hispanic Americans and in southern states, where obesity is also above average.  Experts see Philadelphiaâ€™s success, and the innovative strategy it adopted to get there, as a sign that other cities will soon follow. â€œThis is an important harbinger of what is going to come and people in Philadelphia will see this as important part of their history,â€ predicted Kelly Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, who is an advocate of the soda tax. Historically, the idea for a soda tax first came up in the context of improving health, Brownell said. But initiatives that focused on the tax as a means to cut consumption for health reasons have met with derision and failed. Americans donâ€™t like being told what to do and the soda lobby has used that to its advantage. Recasting the tax as a budget issue, as Philadelphiaâ€™s mayor Jim Kenney did, has proved more palatable. The tax, which is projected to bring in $91m in the first year, will be used to pay for expanding   as well as improving parks, libraries and recreation centers. Philadelphia has high fixed costs which made it difficult to find revenue to pay for expanding   in the city, explains Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Kenney. The mayor did not want to raise property taxes again, said Hitt, so the soda tax was settled on as an alternative revenue source to help fund   expansion. David Goldberg, spokesman for Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda tax initiatives, predicts that San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, California as well as Boulder, Colorado, will all pass similar taxes this year in the wake of Philadelphiaâ€™s success. A number of other cities are now in the primary stages of considering the tax as well, he adds. The American Beverage Association (ABA) the lobbying group for soda manufacturers, which strongly opposes the tax, has said it will â€œtake legal action to stop itâ€ according to spokeswoman Lauren Kane. The ABA has referred to the tax as â€œregressiveâ€ and â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ noting that â€œsimilar tax proposals have been rejected 43 times across the country in the past eight years, including twice in Philadelphiaâ€. A tax can be regressive if a larger percentage of a poor personâ€™s income goes into acquiring an item, or a lower income bracket is taxed at a higher rate than a higher income bracket. Philadelphia feels confident about its legal standing, said Hitt, noting that the cityâ€™s lawyers vetted the proposal and addressed all the arguments that the ABA has raised. The US has many regressive taxes, and being regressive alone does not make a tax impermissible, explained Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting, citing examples of other regressive taxes such as tobacco and alcohol taxes which impact the poor disproportionately more than the better off. Goldberg argues that it makes sense that a tax that impacts poorer communities, would also be the one that benefits those communities by expanding early education for children. It was a smart policy decision by Philadelphiaâ€™s mayor to â€œcarve out some of the industry profits that have come out of poor communities primarily and put them back into the community to benefit the future prospect of kids in those poorer communitiesâ€ Goldberg said. Other legal arguments raised include those around Pennsylvaniaâ€™s constitution, which has a uniformity clause. The uniformity clause means all items in a certain class must be taxed at the same rate, so for example all real estate, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial is taxed at the same rate. So if a tax is imposed, all beverages, including bottled water, could be seen as one class. Sweetened beverages, Hitt argues, are a distinct class because of their negative health effects. The case could â€œfor sureâ€ go to court and may take a couple of years to resolve, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. In the meantime, the ABA would seek a stay pending litigation, which it may or may not be granted, explains Briffault. Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014. Soda consumption in Berkeley was already low before the tax. The ABA did not challenge Berkeleyâ€™s soda tax, underscoring the impact Philadelphiaâ€™s tax is expected to have on similar measures in other cities. â€œIf the Philly tax didnâ€™t mean anything, the soda industry would not have plunked more than $4m into fighting it and promised more in implied bribes,â€ says Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. While Philadelphia works to implement its tax, which is slated to go into effect in January 2017, other cities are taking note of its successful strategy. â€œThere is great public support for tax funds earmarked for social purposes,â€ says Nestle. Focusing on soda taxes as a revenue source also brings â€œa whole other group of political figures to the mixâ€ points out Brownell. Previously, only politicians focused on health would get involved with soda tax proposals, but the new strategy brings in politicians who are looking for new revenue generating possibilities for projects for their constituents, explains Brownell. â€œMy guess is that the floodgates will open pretty quickly, Brownell says.",50,180,"983212485846151168	983313428050784256	983355453387169792	983355600997404673	983355719792590850	983355883735408640	983356062387572738	983356331334819840	983356797388980224	983357377868107776	983357708698095619	983358319451623424	983358492156354560	983358996756160512	983359418975825921	983360364971773952	983360773119528960	983364596827385857	983364731430952961	983364744630370304	983367584170086400	983369630097072129	983371164314750976	983372008019853314	983372781692817408	983373014208339968	983380887252455425	983381355630247942	983387437186666496	983388369534283776	983391350115758080	983396842149961729	983398223736918017	983398577517936640	983398786650193920	983398892271054849	983398945119449089	983399056805322757	983399840804728832	983399918445342720	983399989467639808	983400253712949250	983400410621689856	983400903662297088	983401250443153408	983401274933743616	983401898547011586	983402079661232128	983402572894498816	983403577606594571	983404493659410433	983404784328761344	983404908706754561	983405961527349248	983406182093197315	983406287445725184	983407184913383424	983409189962760197	983409353641295878	983410090806951936	983410097773858817	983410761811791874	983410938471682048	983411353753870336	983412221525950464	983412371636047872	983412600779235329	983413757153103877	983413890078789637	983416113563254789	983417796645171200	983418263374782464	983418619404136449	983418910073536512	983419088432189443	983419295043608577	983419753074065410	983420472590258176	983420829328396291	983420843496685569	983421563931279360	983421819553308672	983425702631387142	983425829223841792	983436389441245186	983436400602308609	983438026457071616	983439171682488321	983439943996502016	983442423316656131	983449855501750272	983451330361675778	983456383294234624	983458442894610433	983468138808389632	983475445369921536	983486828195008512	983496590819143680	983520833044959232	983522102627192832	983526583116935168	983530030998237184	983534322211749888	983535856395931648	983543867554324482	983551702883172353	983576855654563840	983585004948217856	983608671291756544	983676873166282752	983693402570088451	983701253430628352	984050439527325697	984132752894255104	984199327101980677	984220930116333568	984259800967106560	984274693778825217	984443991528587264	984459472507752448	984665805483720705	986002554118172673",fake

With the election of Donald Trump, a man who has declared heâ€™s in favour of torture and killing the families of terrorist offenders, and who shows admiration for autocrats, many Europeans woke up on 9 November feeling that the America they admire had been taken from them. America was never perfect by any means. No democracy is. But the erosion of Americaâ€™s image as a democracy capable of underwriting a shared liberal world order, combined with the worst instincts this risks amplifying within Europeâ€™s own political discourse, represents the biggest threat to the west as we have known it in the last seven decades. Itâ€™s a fair bet that Angela Merkel, an East German and Europeâ€™s most powerful and respected leader today, immediately felt the daunting contrast between two 9 Novembers  â€”   one the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, full of hope, the other, when Trump sealed his victory, full of anxiety. Back in 1989, when joyful crowds broke through the wall, the symbol of Europeâ€™s division and the oppression of entire nations, Merkel went to Berlinâ€™s Bornholmer Strasse crossing to the west. As a politician, Merkel has often spoken of the importance of American values to her personally, and to Europe. In 2009 she gave a speech to the US Congress  â€”   the first German chancellor to do so since Konrad Adenauer in 1957  â€”   in which she spoke of her â€œenthusiasmâ€ for â€œthe American dreamâ€ where â€œthe air is full of the spirit of freedomâ€. So it was no surprise that this 9 November, her first reaction to Trumpâ€™s election was so calibrated and forceful. She listed the â€œcommon valuesâ€ that bind Germany and the US together: â€œDemocracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views. â€ She then added: â€œIt is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation. â€ It was a remarkable statement, one that no other German chancellor has ever had to make  â€”   or indeed felt obliged to. In essence, Merkel set conditions on cooperation with the US president. She seemed to put values before the question of alliances  â€”   or at least, to rank them just as highly. And this, coming from the leader of a country whose very democracy and institutions are historically owed to Americaâ€™s postwar political engineering in Europe. I can think of no other example of a German leader taking the United States so openly and bluntly to task on the question of respecting values. Well, actually, there is a one precedent: in 2006, when Merkel first travelled to Washington as chancellor, she made a point of criticising GuantÃ¡namo, calling for the campâ€™s closure and for respect for rule of law, before meeting with George W Bush. Merkel is well aware that if today the US enters a dark and unfathomable era of illiberalism, the fallout in Europe will be immense, and the foundations of the European project, already badly shaken, will be in even greater danger. She acted last year as a guardian of the principle of international asylum. And she is deeply concerned about the risk of France being swept away by the Marine Le Pen phenomenon. Now, she is calling for Europeâ€™s powerful ally to be true to the essence of transatlantic bonds: values, not just institutions, military hardware or trade. If the US is no longer able to give the right cues, those in Europe who want to save whatever can be saved of liberal democracy find themselves   and weakened. Equally, if America cares no longer for the values that are meant to be enshrined in the EU project, then Europeâ€™s capacity to show resilience in the face of forces that want it dismantled is instantly diminished. It only takes one look at the way European demagogues and extremists have applauded Trumpâ€™s election, and another look at how it was greeted in Moscow, to know this problem of perception, the question of Americaâ€™s image and its link with Europe, is essential. There is of course much speculation about Donald Trumpâ€™s foreign policy. No doubt, his rhetoric has been worrying. But there are as yet more unknowns than knowns. What we do know for certain is that Trumpâ€™s success has wrecked the notion that the American nation wholeheartedly stands for the values of liberal democracy. And this is happening at time when those values are being increasingly questioned in Europe. Trump has cast a dark shadow on Americaâ€™s reputation, adding to the blow suffered by liberal values as a result of Britainâ€™s referendum. This is why the dread felt now by so many Europeans is as overwhelming as the excitement and optimism which seized everyone on that other 9 November, 27 years ago: 1989 was not just a victory for Europeans but a victory for America and its values. The US had not only guaranteed the security of western European countries since the second world war, it had played a crucial role in consolidating democracy and reconciliation. There simply would never have been a European project, without Americaâ€™s engagement and interest. If there is now a threat hanging over the west, it comes first and foremost from the danger that this psychological and political link with America might break. This disappointment is arguably bigger than fears that Nato defence guarantees might evaporate overnight. This is why, on the day after Americaâ€™s election, Merkel was right to speak of values rather than of alliances. She, very likely, had that 9 November anniversary in mind.",218,420,"1008322058886045696	1008326949649965056	1008335580894253057	1008353680280752129	1008361151984357376	1008371671152189441	1008374325584498688	1008375418649563136	1008379993812946944	1008381227399811072	1008382807155134464	1008383096046145537	1008383212261990401	1008383497600487424	1008383723002318849	1008384851907633153	1008388355187494912	1008417728745492481	1008433172948938752	1008448607563862016	1008449725052284928	1008673265592741893	1008675572766126080	1008706172738768898	1008731548030586880	1008745647263158273	1008764250892963840	1009015469334917120	1012779302851493889	1015936887788376065	1015937285467136001	1018662238784245760",fake

But heâ€™s just one of thousands of criminal defendants in America hoping to clear their names. Adnan Syed, the    subject of Serial, was convicted of the murder of his   Hae Min Lee after she was found strangled to death in 1999. Last week, judge Martin Welch granted Syedâ€™s request for a retrial and vacated his conviction. Syed had served more than 16 years of a life sentence before Thursdayâ€™s ruling, and his attorney has said that he might seek bail for Syed so that he can be released from prison before the proceedings continue.  The specifics of Leeâ€™s death, and the evidence implicating Syed, have been subject to intense scrutiny thanks to the attention brought by Serial and the additional investigations it spawned. But Syed is one among scores of criminal defendants who say theyâ€™ve been wrongfully convicted and are now working from behind bars to prove their innocence. Since 1989, the National Registry of Exonerations has tracked more than 1, 830 exonerations in the US, a number the registry estimates to be a â€œfractionâ€ of the total exonerations in that time period. The Guardian looked at five of the many cases across the country in which criminal defendants are seeking retrials or other recourse to clear their names. The original case: Danny Lee Hill was found guilty of multiple charges in the brutal beating and death of a    boy in Warren, Ohio. The boy died two days after he was beaten and raped in September 1985. Timothy Combs, then 17, was also found guilty in the attack. Length of imprisonment: Hill was sentenced to death in 1986, and he has waited in prison through the ongoing appeals process since then. Cause for review: When Hill, 49, was originally convicted, prosecutors said that bite marks had been found on the boyâ€™s penis and brought an oral surgeon to testify that the marks had come from Hillâ€™s teeth. The alleged bite marks were the only physical evidence presented by the prosecution that tied Hill to the crime, according to his attorney Vicki Werneke.  Since then, the scientific consensus around bite marks has shifted dramatically to acknowledge the imprecision behind   science. Hillâ€™s attorneys said they are questioning the admissibility of both the   science used to convict Hill and the confession that the    gave. They added that they plan to present testimony on the unreliability of   evidence in general as well as from a   expert who says the marks werenâ€™t made by human teeth. Whatâ€™s next: Hillâ€™s attorneys are pursuing multiple paths toward a retrial, and the state has scheduled hearings for September to determine whether there is sufficient new evidence to grant a retrial. The original case: Johnson was convicted of assault on a   death and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Johnson, a licensed daycare provider in San Diego, was arrested after an infant in her care hit her head, and later stopped breathing and died. Authorities said Johnson intentionally abused and aggressively shook the child because she was angry when the    wouldnâ€™t stop crying Johnson said that the baby suffered an accidental fall from a high chair. Length of imprisonment: Johnson, 71, has been behind bars since she was found guilty in 1999. Cause for review: Johnson is among of slew of criminal defendants convicted in cases of   â€œshaken baby syndromeâ€ a controversial diagnosis for young children injured as a result of forceful shaking. The medical consensus around shaken baby syndrome and childhood head trauma has evolved since Johnsonâ€™s conviction, calling into question her case and many others in which prosecutors alleged childrenâ€™s fatal injuries were caused by intentional abuse. New research suggests that shaken baby syndrome has been over diagnosed and has spurred intense debate over what actually indicates a case of shaken baby syndrome. Johnsonâ€™s attorneys say the childâ€™s, Whatâ€™s next: Johnson is one of 12 defendants for whom the California Innocence Project is asking Governor Jerry Brown to grant clemency. In January, a judge said that Johnson could seek a retrial. The original case: Nathaniel Epps was convicted of rape and other violent crimes with his    Percell Warren in a 1996 attack of a woman in Norfolk, Virginia. Prosecutors said Epps and Warren broke into the womanâ€™s home and raped her at gunpoint before beating her with the pistol. Length of imprisonment: Epps, 53, has served 20 years of a   sentence. Warren died from lung cancer in prison in 2012. Cause for review: Newly tested DNA evidence exonerates both men, according to the Innocence Project. Sperm from two men was found on the victimâ€™s jeans, and Warrenâ€™s DNA was not found in the mixture. Although Eppsâ€™s couldnâ€™t be definitively excluded from the mixture, his lawyers say the evidence exonerates him because of the stateâ€™s theory that Warren and Epps committed the crime together. â€œDNA results excluding at least one of the defendants as the source of the sperm proves that they are both actually innocent,â€ Eppsâ€™s lawyers wrote in a brief presenting the evidence. Whatâ€™s next: The Innocence Project is petitioning the Virginia supreme court for Eppsâ€™s full exoneration. His lawyers submitted a petition to the court on 21 June presenting the new DNA evidence and seeking a writ of innocence. The state attorney generalâ€™s office has 30 days to respond. The original case: Prosecutors said Vinson raped a    girl in her bedroom after breaking into her Detroit home through a window. Length of imprisonment: Vinson has been in prison since May 1986 and is serving a   to   sentence. Cause for review: Vinsonâ€™s legal team at the University of Michigan Innocence Clinic say that newly available DNA testing rule him out as a possible suspect in the rape. Attorney Andrew Fletcher said a new analysis of the semen found at the crime scene definitively showed that Vinson couldnâ€™t have been the attacker. Blood cells in the semen found on sheets at the crime scene show that the attacker was blood type O Vinson is blood type AB. The original case: Contreras and his friend Scott Taylor were convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole in 1997. Prosecutors charged the pair with killing Frederick Walker at a barbecue in Santa Clarita, California. Walkerâ€™s beaten body was found dismembered and in trash bags by police. Length of imprisonment: Contreras has been in prison for 19 years. Cause for review: Contreras and Taylor were convicted after a woman at the barbecue told police that both men were responsible for Walkerâ€™s brutal death, in line with authoritiesâ€™ theory that two killers were responsible. In 2009, the woman, Lisa Garringer, recanted her original testimony and later testified that Taylor was the only person involved involved in Walkerâ€™s death. Garringer said she had been coerced by police investigators into implicating both men. Whatâ€™s next: After Garringerâ€™s new testimony, a Los Angeles superior court judge refused to reverse Contrerasâ€™s conviction, saying he did not find her to be a credible witness.

politifact14005,http://now8news.com/united-airlines-flight-attendant-slaps-crying-baby/,United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight,"The gun manufacturer Smith  Wessonâ€™s share price reached an   high on Monday after it was reported that the background checks for new guns had set a new record for July. Shortly after the FBI announced Julyâ€™s figures on Monday afternoon, shares in the second largest gun manufacturer hit $30. 59 each. Smith  Wessonâ€™s shares closed the day at an   high of $30. 36, up 3% for the day and beating a previous record high of $29. 37 set in March. Shares in Sturm Ruger, the USâ€™s largest gun maker, also surged on the news, ending the day up 2% at $69. 40. A total of 2, 197, 169 firearms background checks were processed last month, according to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Thatâ€™s up from 1, 600, 832 background checks processed in July 2015 and 891, 224 checks processed in July 2008, months before Barack Obama was elected president.  Firearms background checks are not the most accurate measure of gun sales, as not every background check results in a purchase. Additionally, multiple firearms can be purchased with one background check. The figure is, however, used to gauge the demand for firearms and the health of the market.  The demand for firearms in the US has been on the rise, fuelled by fears of a crackdown on ownership in the wake of a series of mass shootings. July was the 15th month in a row that a new record has been set for that particular time of the year.

The South Korean company recalled 2. 5m phones last week following reports that some units had caught fire during or after charging. One    from New York was reportedly using a Galaxy Note 7 to watch videos on Saturday when it burst into flames, causing burns to his body.  His grandmother Linda Lewis told the New York Post: â€œHe doesnâ€™t want to see or go near any phones. Heâ€™s been crying to his mother. â€ Samsung has said that battery problems are responsible for the explosions but that it cannot be sure at this stage which of the phones it has sold are affected. In a statement the company introduced a product exchange program that allows all owners to trade their devices for a new one.  â€œWe strongly advise all customers to use this exchange program because your safety is our top priority. Additional sales and shipments of the affected devices have been stopped, but if you already have a Galaxy Note 7, we strongly advise that you replace it. â€ â€œUntil a replacement device is provided, Samsung asks all customers with a Galaxy Note 7 smartphone to power down your device and return it to its place of purchase at your earliest opportunity,â€ the statement added. Users who donâ€™t follow Samsungâ€™s recommendations may find their device, which only launched last month, remotely deactivated. Unconfirmed reports stemming from a Reddit thread have suggested that Samsung will brick affected Note 7s starting as soon as 30 September. Smartphones typically have a remote kill switch to deter   thieves. As a safety measure, airlines across the US started to warn passengers to avoid switching on or charging their Note 7s during flights, in line with advice from the Federal Aviation Authority. Customers can trade their Galaxy Note 7 for a new version of the smartphone that isnâ€™t faulty or they can choose a different model of smartphone, including the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, and receive a refund for the price difference between devices. To sweeten the inconvenience, Samsung is also issuing US customers with a $25 gift card. The companyâ€™s share price has plummeted in response to the recall.  Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.

politifact13565,www.haaretz.com/us-news/how-donald-trump-lost-the-war-on-christmas-1.5629520,How Donald Trump Lost the 'War on Christmas',"Donald Trump has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration. The Republican presidential candidate doubled down on his hardline stance in a speech on Wednesday night which delighted core supporters and dismayed his few remaining Latino allies who had expected a tack towards moderation. Speaking hours after a lightning visit to Mexico, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, he was sticking with his plan for a â€œdeportation forceâ€ to intercept illegal border crossers and hunt down criminal â€œillegal aliensâ€ already in the US. â€œWe are going to take our country back,â€ he said, repeating a mantra from the primary campaign. Speaking largely from a teleprompter, he also reiterated his vow to make Mexico pay for a   wall which, he said, would bristle with sensors, towers and guards. â€œWe will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They donâ€™t know it yet, but theyâ€™re going to pay for it. â€ Trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls with just 69 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides had recently fuelled expectations of a â€œsofteningâ€ of immigration policy, prompting speculation about a  . Instead the speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City, where Trump met President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. The GOP nominee roused the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage â€œangel momsâ€ whose children were killed. He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gives work permits to about 800, 000 young immigrants who came to the US as children  â€”   a stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach. Anybody who entered the US illegally would be subject to deportation and there should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, he said. â€œThere will be no amnesty. â€ Trump also promised ideological tests for   visa applicants, a â€œsunsetâ€ on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years and a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that donâ€™t deport undocumented immigrants. The rhetoric trampled over the hopes of Trumpâ€™s dwindling band of conservative Latino supporters. â€œThis is how I feel: disappointed and misled,â€ tweeted Alfonso Aguilar, head of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. Jacob Monty, a member of Trumpâ€™s National Hispanic advisory council, resigned, Politico reported. The rightwing columnist Ann Coulter, in contrast, exulted. â€œWow. This doesnâ€™t sound like â€œsoftening. â€ GO, TRUMP! !!â€ she tweeted. Trump did however imply most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would remain untouched while his putative administration focused on deporting 2 million with alleged criminal records. â€œWe will begin moving them out, day one. My first hour in office, those people are gone. â€ The ambiguity over the fate of   undocumented immigrants marked a tacit retreat from Trumpâ€™s earlier vows to swiftly deport all 11 million people. The lack of clarity allowed supporters and critics to fill in the blanks with their own wishes and anxieties. Trumpâ€™s policy could in theory yet resemble that of Obama, who has deported millions, and GOP rivals such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, whom Trump accused of supporting de facto amnesty. The speech capped a whirlwind day of political theatre in which Trump, after a year of denigrating Mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and drug dealers, met President PeÃ±a Nieto in Mexico City, triggering a backlash from Mexicans who denounced the New York businessman as a tyrant, and worse. Trump emerged from the private meeting at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, heaping praise on Mexican immigrants. â€œThey are amazing people, amazing people . .. Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular and hardworking people. â€ He said the   meeting with PeÃ±a Nieto was â€œsubstantiveâ€ and â€œexcellentâ€ but did not touch on his pledge to force Mexico to pay for the wall. â€œWeâ€™re saving that discussion for a later date. â€ Mexicoâ€™s president however said he did broach the topic and told Trump Mexico would not pay. In a late evening television interview, an   PeÃ±a Nieto said: â€œHis policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing. â€œThat risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations. â€  Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, sidelined by another day of Trump drama, seized on the discrepancy: â€œIt turns out Trump didnâ€™t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. â€ The unexpected visit  â€”   Trumpâ€™s first meeting with a head of state since he became a candidate  â€”   yielded presidential optics in the form of a podium and marble backdrop in an international setting. Speaking beneath a Mexican flag the casino   reality TV star sounded restrained and diplomatic. That evaporated when he bounded onto the podium in Phoenix, 200 miles north of the border, and seemed energised by the crowd, even though the cavernous convention centre was  . â€œThere is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that is the wellbeing of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. â€ The audience cheered and chanted â€œUSAâ€. Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, a controversial hunter of suspected undocumented people, New Yorkâ€™s former mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trumpâ€™s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, warmed up the crowd before Trump arrived.  Supporters hailed his   foray as evidence he could negotiate with foreign leaders and secure US interests. George Buchanan, 71, a retired flooring installer, said it also showed courage. â€œItâ€™s dangerous. Youâ€™ve got those Mexican people over there, drug lords. The drug lords donâ€™t want him to build the wall. â€ Some in the crowd sensed that behind the brash reiteration of mass deportations Trump was in fact edging towards a more moderate, viable, policy. â€œI think heâ€™s loosening up, becoming more realistic,â€ said Nancy Lewis, 56, a retired law enforcer. â€œAnd Iâ€™m OK with that. I have Hispanic friends. â€ Michelle Des Marais, 78, appeared willing to forgive Trump if he did end up retreating. â€œItâ€™s a hard fight but at least heâ€™s trying. â€",818,721,"808389715929903104	808436243662917633	808442840242069504	808443248561700866	808464417822281728	808475109799424001	808487691583127552	808488224310042624	808518324397244416	808591307593502721	808720913491492865	808721086833491969	808723434825916416	808723493231525888	808739683920412672	808756157846323200	808769663551373312	808779759928877060	808823883424026624	808824040538271744	808857373179838464	808990871328792577	809139286377279488	809139638837374978	809148465989042176	809163415948316672	809171121673277440	809175566318501889	809203307591954432	809209898743590912	809417694848122880	809471057207951360	809574148473323520	809801448208769024	810135234616369154	810376676387487746	810376746273013761	811697194722017280	811697210526208001	835959664747679744",fake

She walked to an overlook where a sign warned against swimming and diving. â€œThisâ€  â€”   she opened her arms wide  â€”   â€œused to be the marina. â€ Down below, docks sat among nettles and thistles growing on what used to be the lake bed. The boat ramp led to sunbaked dirt, and squirrels skittered across the concrete.  â€œThey put a tombstone right in the middle of it,â€ said Aubrey, pointing into the undergrowth. Sure enough, a small Halloween decoration had been erected in the former harbor. One of the largest natural lakes in the state, Eagle Lake is a shock of blue amid a tawny, isolated upland. But it has fallen around 15ft since 1999, a decline thought to have been exacerbated by climate change. The main lakeside community of Spalding, a   drive north of the marina, is dotted with â€œfor saleâ€ signs, and its tidy streets are empty. The waterfront is now a meadow, and the lake has receded to a thin strip in the distance, like an alluring mirage. There are no longer any restaurants, and the general store is shuttered. Adding to the air of misfortune, dozens of the wells that supply residents with water have gone dry, necessitating deeper ones. The hardships facing the lake stand in contrast to its reputation as a fishery. According to the outdoors writer Tom Stienstra, â€œIt was among the most prized lakes in America. â€  Its main attraction is the indigenous Eagle Lake rainbow trout, whose   meat is said to be uncommonly delicious. Anglers continue to land big, healthy fish. But half as many of them are visiting, in part because only one boat ramp on the entire,    lake is still operational. â€œGimme water, lord,â€ said Aubrey, a    with a   vibe and a cigarette crackle in her voice. â€œI think thatâ€™s the thought of everyone round here. â€ In the shadow of the disused marina, she backed her trailer down the ramp and into the glassy shallows as chub minnows darted away. There was a thump as the wheels dropped onto the mud at the end, a sign of how close the structure is to being unusable. Aubrey undid some clips, and her   Dream Catcher, floated onto the lake. Chugging out, it was hard to tell that anything was amiss. The unruffled water stretched to sere,   hills and a cloudless sky. White pelicans cruised past like ungainly swans. Grebes emitted tinkling chirps and chuckles, and pairs of them performed a courtship dance in which they lifted themselves off the surface and appeared to run across it. When the boat approached, they dove underwater instead of flying away. Once a fishing guide, Aubrey wore enamel earrings in the shape of trout. â€œThereâ€™s more to Eagle Lake than just fishing,â€ she said. â€œOur hearts are here. Our souls are here. â€ Even so, spurs of dry land have appeared where previously there was none. Aubrey pulled into the lee of a sand bar that had gradually risen out of the waves. â€œBefore this area was above water, this was just black with grebes,â€ she said. Last year, some vast northern sections of the lake almost dried up completely, only to be regenerated, to a certain extent, by the winter rains. They were still too shallow for Dream Catcher.  Back at the marina, operated by a couple named Grace and Scott McCullough, it was lunchtime. With vacationers perusing snacks and fishing lures in the large,   shop, and hot food on offer from a trailer, it felt like the vacation spot that Eagle Lake prides itself on being. Sitting in the storeroom, Grace ticked off some theories sheâ€™d heard to explain the low water. Perhaps someone had bought the rights to the aquifer and was secretly draining it. Maybe   at a neighboring lake was leaving them with less moisture. As she sees it, the decline is part of a normal cycle. Itâ€™s true that California is prone to drought, and Eagle Lakeâ€™s level, determined primarily by precipitation, has oscillated over the decades. Its longtime historic low was in the 1930s, though in 2015 it went lower. At a picnic table outside, there was skepticism as to whether Eagle Lake was at the vanguard of a more ominous,   global shift. â€œIâ€™m not an    believer that we can adjust the climate of this earth that much,â€ said Scott McCullough, a retired marine. â€œI agree with Scott,â€ said Lee Crane, a   dentist from Sacramento, who was eating burgers at the other end of the table with his wife, Dottie. â€œYou could take all the diesel stacks in the United States and let â€˜em go and the earth wouldnâ€™t know the difference, in my opinion. â€ Bobette Jones, an ecologist with the Eagle Lake ranger district, sees it differently. With less snow falling in the area, there is less snowmelt to recharge the watershed, while more dry months each year mean increased evaporation. â€œI think thereâ€™s a pretty strong trend that the lake is definitely going to be much more shallow in the future,â€ she said by telephone. â€œItâ€™s sort of a    and   story, but that is what the data is showing. Hopefully weâ€™re wrong. â€ As evening approached, boat mechanic James Watts was stood in the weedy lot of his repair shop in Spalding. â€œOn opening morning, Iâ€™d have boats lined up down the street,â€ he said, referring to the start of the fishing season. â€œNow as you see there ainâ€™t no boats around here. â€ Watts fell for Eagle Lake on a fishing trip, and his family built the shop over 20 years ago. In 2013, he was forced to move the business to a nearby town, where there was more money to be made. All around him were the   boats he was saving for spares and others he was storing for acquaintances. Almost the only sound was the shushing of wind through the trees. â€œWe watched the water level go and every year it was like, donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll come back, itâ€™ll come back. And three years ago was when it actually turned and went to nothing. â€ Wearing a grimy work shirt bearing his name, Watts lit a cigarette, leaned against one of the hulls, and stared into space. Surely the lake would return to Spalding, he mused, even if not during his lifetime.",377,936,"896587317439221760	896596640517304324	896606483303059456	897471292756119552",fake
politifact14565,sportfella.com/breaking-fox-sports-cancels-nfl-broadcasts-players-respect-flag/,BREAKING: Fox Sports Cancels ALL NFL Broadcasts ‘Until Players Respect The Flag’,"The Chilcot inquiry has delivered a damning verdict on the decision by former prime minister Tony Blair to commit British troops to the   invasion of Iraq in 2003. It says: Chilcot is withering about Blairâ€™s choice to join the US invasion. He says: â€œWe have concluded that the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. Military action at that time was not a last resort. â€ Chilcot finds that Blair deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by the Iraqi regime as he sought to make the case for military action to MPs and the public in the buildup to the invasion in 2002 and 2003. The then prime minister disregarded warnings about the potential consequences of military action, and relied too heavily on his own beliefs, rather than the more nuanced judgments of the intelligence services. â€œThe judgments about Iraqâ€™s capabilities . .. were presented with a certainty that was not justified,â€ the report says. Tony Blair wrote to George W Bush eight months before the Iraq invasion to offer his unqualified backing for war well before UN weapons inspectors had complete their work, saying: â€œI will be with you, whatever. â€ In a   memo marked secret and personal, the then British prime minister told Bush, US president at the time, in July 2002 that the removal of Saddam Hussein would â€œfree up the regionâ€ even if Iraqis may â€œfeel ambivalent about being invadedâ€. It was one of 29 letters Blair sent to Bush in the   to the Iraq war, during the conflict and in its devastating aftermath, released on Wednesday as part of the Chilcot report. Chilcot finds that the decision made by Tony Blairâ€™s cabinetâ€™s to invade was made in circumstances that were â€œfar from satisfactoryâ€. The inquiry did not reach a view on the legality of the war, saying this could only be assessed by a â€œproperly constituted and internationally recognised courtâ€ but did make a damning assessment of how the decision was made. The process for deciding that the war was legal is described as â€œperfunctoryâ€ by the inquiry, while â€œno formal record was made of that decision, and the precise grounds on which it was made remains unclearâ€. The inquiry found that the Bush administration repeatedly   advice from the UK on how to oversee Iraq after the invasion, including the involvement of the United Nations, the control of Iraqi oil money and the extent to which better security should be put at the heart of the military operation. The inquiry specifically criticises the way in which the US dismantled the security apparatus of the Saddam Hussein army and describes the whole invasion as a strategic failure. Iran, North Korea and Libya were considered greater threats in terms of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation, and the UK joint intelligence committee believed it would take Iraq five years, after the lifting of sanctions, to produce enough fissile material for a weapon, Chilcot finds. Britainâ€™s previous strategy of containment could have been adopted and continued for some time. The Chilcot report identifies a series of major blunders by the British intelligence services that produced â€œflawedâ€ information about Saddamâ€™s alleged weapons of mass destruction, the basis for going to war. Chilcot says the intelligence community worked from the start on the misguided assumption that Saddam had WMDs and made no attempt to consider the possibility that he had got rid of them, which he had. The UKâ€™s military involvement in Iraq ended with the â€œhumiliatingâ€ decision to strike deals with enemy militias because British forces were seriously   and there was â€œwholly inadequateâ€ planning and preparation for life after Saddam Hussein, the Chilcot report finds. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) planned the invasion in a rush and was slow to react to the security threats on the ground, particularly the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that killed so many troops, the report says. Chilcot rejects the view that the UK would have lost diplomatic influence if it had refused to join the war. â€œBlair was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider alliance with the US very carefully,â€ the report says. But it adds: â€œIf the UK had refused to join the US in the war it would not have led to a fundamental or lasting change in the UKâ€™s relationship with the US. â€ The report says that between early 2002 and March 2003 Blair was told that,   Iraq could degenerate into civil war. In September 2002, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, predicted â€œa terrible bloodletting of revenge after Saddam goesâ€ adding: â€œTraditional in Iraq after conflict. â€ Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador to the US, added: â€œIt will probably make pacifying Afghanistan look like childâ€™s play. â€ Chilcot rejects Blairâ€™s claim that the subsequent chaos and sectarian conflict could not have been predicted. According to Chilcot, Blair did not identify which ministers were responsible for postwar planning and strategy. The prime minister also failed to press Bush for â€œdefinitive assurancesâ€ about the USâ€™s   plans. Nor did he envisage anything other than the   scenario once the invasion was over: that a   and   force would find itself operating in a â€œrelatively benign security environmentâ€. All of this contributed to Britainâ€™s ultimate strategic failure. The Bush administration appointed ambassador Paul Bremer to head a new coalition provisional authority in Baghdad. The UK had practically no input into subsequent decisions taken by Bremer, including the dissolving of Saddamâ€™s army and security structures. This decision alienated the Sunni community and fed the insurgency. Blair continued to talk to Bush, but Britain had little influence on the ground over    policymaking.  Chilcot says that by 2009, when UK forces were pulled out of Iraq, Downing Street was facing strategic failure. Iraq was gripped by â€œdeep sectarian divisionsâ€. There was a fragile situation in Basra, rows over oil revenues, and rampant corruption inside Iraqi government ministries. No evidence had been found that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. During this period the government did not reappraise the situation, Chilcot says. He describes as â€œmeagreâ€ the results of Britainâ€™s costly   occupation. Before the war, Blair had said that the   invasion coalition would try to minimise civilian casualties. As the war and occupation unfolded, however, the MoD made only a â€œbroad estimateâ€ of how many Iraqis were being killed. The report says that more time was devoted to which department should have responsibility for the issue than was spent on finding out the number. The governmentâ€™s main interest was to â€œrebut accusations that coalition forces were responsible for the deaths of large numbersâ€ of Iraqis.",600,545,"912013292956131328	912047798081789954	912050607493718016	912052039101841415	912052495471529986	912055523356430338	912056695584624640	912062436110299136	912066301044166657	912067743259570177	912072929562816515	912086163644665856	912098670912339969	912100587738501120	912104079433666560	912105813556256770	912106038039527424	912110696141348865	912111007069343744	912125181811986442	912135597161984000	912142883024666624	912146281526566912	912146896847642624	912194877714255872	912199606464913408	912206202452480000	912244187537408001	912244232173129729	912252024196096000	912266897558732800	912267515149025280	912281987355996161	912299908543209472	912301239454650368	912305016316289024	912313980764540929	912341156284862465	912350880040710144	912368602707263488	912370092268285952	912374698834644995	912377876233691136	912378765019361280	912385991322849280	912394787235430402	912402439004966912	912445077888409600	912495679641137152	912606002335309825	912694931948539905	912725864277843969	912727381575483392	912731910962581504	912732294997315584	912734715832127488	912739008870064128	912739193339699202	912763890655621120	912768086721355776	912780080652337152	912792884088369152	912830180544139264	912862862548271105	912874963887165440	912923999742627840	913018256218361857	913048093012189184	913139824957280256	913160570555195392	913220422702964736	913536034163576833	913537377657851905	913861032216551424	920417923386236928",fake
politifact14564,https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/head-of-nfl-fines-steeler-teammates-1-million-each/,Head Of NFL Fines Steeler Teammates $1 MILLION Each!,"On Thursday, HBO announced a new crop of standup specials to air next year, including hours from Jerrod Carmichael, Pete Holmes and TJ Miller. It comes only a few days after Netflix announced the imminent release of eight new specials, bringing the siteâ€™s total to over two dozen for 2016. Comics include current Saturday Night Live star Michael Che and former SNL star Dana Carvey. This fall will also see a new special from Martin Lawrence on Showtime, his first in 14 years, and a Doug Stanhope hour on NBCâ€™s newish streaming service, Seeso. HBO and Showtime have been producing specials for years, and theyâ€™ve become a major focus for both Netflix and Seeso, and for good reason. Theyâ€™re relatively cheap to produce, attract a young male audience who advertisers covet, and can stay popular for years. And while the prestige of TV lingers, the really important thing is making them available online comics want their material available for new fans to discover. For younger comics, streaming sites increasingly serve as archives of old material (most of Aziz Ansariâ€™s back catalog can be found on Netflix). Not so long ago, doing regular comedy specials was for the privileged few  â€”   George Carlinâ€™s annual HBO specials were a sign of his exalted status. For a rising comic, doing a special is a sign of arriving â€œgetting an hourâ€ signals that you have some degree of talent, fame and bankability. This is mostly due to the way US comics put together material. In the UK, a comedianâ€™s year revolves around producing a show for the Edinburgh Fringe in August, while in Australia, a comic is likely to work toward an hour for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in March. No such central festival exists in the States comedians build up materially slowly through short sets, spinning them into longer routines as they tour around the country. Without a specific deadline to submit a show, material gets honed tighter and tighter over the years, and a special every two to three years is common for most successful comedians. There are, of course, exceptions  â€”   Louis CK has attempted an hour ever year for the past decade. Generally, comedians with looser, more conversational material churn them out more frequently, while precise, dense writers tend to wait longer  â€”   Steven Wright, the king of   has released only two specials in his   career. And for most comics, recording a special means putting that material to bed. Itâ€™s spent it can never be done again on television, and those jokes are phased out of live performances. Thatâ€™s why, for some very successful touring comedians, recording a special holds little appeal. Jerry Seinfeld hasnâ€™t recorded a special since 1998â€™s Iâ€™m Telling You for the Last Time, but heâ€™s been performing standup regularly since then. During his recent run of NYC shows, he told stories about his children as toddlers, even though theyâ€™re now teenagers, a sign that those jokes were probably a decade old. But it doesnâ€™t matter he can keep telling them as he tours the country, and the odds are that most of his audience wonâ€™t have heard them.  Lawrence, on the other hand, has good reason to invest his time in a special. Fresh from a nationwide arena tour, heâ€™ll soon be promoting the third Bad Boys movie, set for a 2018 release, and heâ€™ll be hoping to revive the fanbase he built as a popular standup and sitcom star in the 1990s. With his special on rotation at Showtime, he can prove his relevance in modern comedy.  Some have criticized Netflix for not including more women, but thereâ€™s also narrowness to their ages Che is the only comic on the list under 40. It may be that younger comics are drawn more toward television specials, which allow them to build relationships with networks that could lead to more work, or to producing albums with smaller labels like A Special Thing and Rooftop Comedy, which give them the option of selling CDs as merchandise.  There is now more standup available online than anyone could possibly consume, and while some of itâ€™s excellent, devout comedy fans will know that, when the last comedy boom died in the early 90s, many blamed the proliferation of free standup on television for diluting the product and discouraging people from going out to live shows. Itâ€™s too early to say whether the expansion of streaming content will have the same effect, but when more than 10 new standup specials are announced in the same week, it certainly seems plausible.

politifact14386,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651,Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the Country,"Hillary Clinton has received her first national security briefing as the Democratic presidential nominee, meeting intelligence officials on Saturday for an overview of the major threats facing the US around the globe. The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, received his briefing earlier this month, a customary move for major party nominees but one that has been the subject of a political tussle during the campaign. Some critics and opponents of Trump have questioned whether he is capable of handling sensitive information responsibly some of Clintonâ€™s critics say her use of a private email server while secretary of state raises concern over her ability to protect classified information. Clinton attended her briefing for more than two hours at the FBI office in White Plains, New York, near her suburban home. As Barack Obamaâ€™s secretary of state, she held a high security clearance and received a copy of the presidentâ€™s daily brief, the   US intelligence document that includes sensitive intelligence and analysis from around the world. Saturdayâ€™s briefing was her first since becoming her partyâ€™s nominee and no aides were present, her campaign said. Trump was accompanied to his briefing by retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn and New Jersey governor Chris Christie. The briefings, which are delivered by career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, have been traditional for presidential nominees for more than 60 years, to ensure a smooth transition for the next commander in chief.  Trump was campaigning on Saturday, headlining the Republican senator Joni Ernstâ€™s annual â€œRoast and Rideâ€ fundraiser at the Iowa state fairgrounds in Des Moines. The businessman was not planning to join a   motorcycle ride that is part of the event but nonetheless brought his campaign to a state where polls show a tight contest, rare good news for Republicans in battleground states. In an interview with the Associated Press, Iowaâ€™s Republican governor, Terry Branstad, said he would like Trump to focus his message more on a renewable fuel standard that is important to his stateâ€™s corn farmers. Trump and Clinton are polling â€œabout evenâ€ in the state, Branstad said, adding that he would like Trump to launch campaign ads in Iowa since Clinton has already done so. â€œI donâ€™t like that, but hopefully thatâ€™s going to change,â€ he said.",149,475,"891038695071109121	891039353622994945	891039886307971073	891040505571581957	891045498299273220	891046660322865152	891048683302682628	891048856263180288	891049151856857088	891054910632013825	891060017440403456	891062657884852229	891063209096040448	891068245754695680	891068667923906560	891068912728780800	891069376102678528	891070042942586880	891073784547069955	891074263079415812	891077347058872320	891078988180979714	891087196849098754	891090091841605632	891108622872100864	891111432590327808	891118745141354497	891125292663808000	891126357618565120	891127087939145728	891130954949025792	891133960956203008	891147188813910016	891161938436247552	891265214473228288	891282012199374848	891291078846021632	891304354849976321	891316393467150340	891319255773450240	891323740109275136	891325825634762752	891356597494075392	891359242787180544	891370598823276545	891375303469260800	891381244885217281	891385021524848640	891385579807617024	891387875018895360	891388300728172546	891389017945722884	891399167955939328	891403519990910978	891406430699376640	891412467435352065	891413799709929472	891421151850881024	891433268352086017	891457198538280960	891457729147027457	891460384850366466	891472319247523840	891474718116761600	891477327837843457	891477420439736321	891484708495863808	891484942089244672	891485488296730629	891487068408266753	891496166952755200	891497221488881664	891498586743205888	891502929013874688	891503706029641730	891517086727639040	891544556390326272	891578863754641408	891637265222578178	891638130608152576	891660127190880261	891687072305643520	891690627590758401	891697823401496578	891703463486345216	891712123855876097	891727544654995458	891739318175371266	891744212835872768	891780253676441601	891796244552716288	891798954261610496	891805307801935872	891824707149991937	891835079462338560	891846249833529344	891860283496464384	891898465122254848	891911116896452609	891930508539461633	891989819269591044	892019037772840960	892042769342099457	892043492565934081	892089498670116864	892093941020893184	892136831424249856	892143426715758593	892159046421291012	892174288723345408	892240489629536256	892340090168643585	892565807808618497	892729919574122496	893942982075965440	903605973251743744	904856004222963715",fake
politifact14879,obama.trendolizer.com/2017/12/breaking-sasha-obama-just-crashed-her-expensive-new-car-into-a-lake.html,BREAKING: Sasha Obama Just Crashed Her Expensive New Car Into A Lake,"Hillary Clinton hinted at a possible landslide in the 8 November election, exhorting several thousand supporters at a San Francisco fundraiser on Thursday to help her â€œhave the kind of victory we needâ€ to serve as a â€œrebukeâ€ to Donald Trump. On a day when Trump went on the attack  â€”   calling women who have accused him of inappropriate touching and kissing â€œhorrible, horrible liarsâ€  â€”   an increasingly confident Clinton encouraged her backers to double down on their efforts during the final weeks of the fractious 2016 campaign.  â€œEverything we care about is at risk,â€ she said. â€œIf you can help me to have the kind of victory we need, that stands as a rebuke of all the bigotry and bullying weâ€™ve seen, then together, together we will build the future that all of us, particularly the children of our country, deserve to have. â€ Just one day earlier, the floodgates began to open up on Trump, as women accused him of putting his hands up a womanâ€™s skirt on an airplane, shoving his tongue down a reporterâ€™s throat at his    property in Florida, bursting into beauty pageant dressing rooms and ogling the   contestants. Not one but two incidents from 1992 surfaced in which the Republican standard bearer  â€”   then 46  â€”   told young girls that he would be dating them in the    future.  During the San Francisco fundraiser, Clinton rued that â€œthe disturbing stories just keep comingâ€. â€œThe whole world has heard Trump brag about how he mistreats women,â€ Clinton said. â€œBut itâ€™s more than just the way he degrades women, as horrible as that is. He has attacked immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims and our military, which heâ€™s called a disaster. â€œThereâ€™s hardly any part of America that he has not targeted,â€ she continued. â€œNow, it makes you want to turn off the news. It makes you want to unplug the internet. Or just look at cat gifs. Believe me, I get it. In the last few weeks, Iâ€™ve watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things. â€ Clintonâ€™s poll numbers have improved since the recent scandals broke. RealClear Politicsâ€™ running average of national surveys has Clinton ahead by 6. 7 points in a   race.  Still, in the next 26 days, she said, â€œWeâ€™ve got a job to do. â€ Her Republican challenger batted away accusations on Wednesday and Thursday, threatened to sue the New York Times and blamed negative stories on a conspiracy between Clinton and the media. Clinton, in contrast, talked about job growth and healing the nation at rallies in Nevada and Colorado and smaller events in San Francisco. In Pueblo, Colorado, on Wednesday, she commiserated with a protester who tried to shout her down: â€œGotta feel a little sorry for them. Theyâ€™ve had a bad couple of weeks. â€ But she also talked during this west coast swing about how hard it has been to focus on important policy matters when running against a candidate like Trump  â€”   a man who has polarized the nation and his own party for months and fought against allegations of sexual impropriety for the past week. â€œAs negative as this campaign has become, because of the person who achieved the nomination on the other side, you cannot talk about what we should do to make sure that every child has preschool education,â€ Clinton said Thursday afternoon. â€œWe havenâ€™t had a chance to talk about how weâ€™re going to fix what doesnâ€™t work with the Affordable Care Act,â€ she continued. â€œWe havenâ€™t gotten a chance to talk about how weâ€™re going to defend womenâ€™s rights and Planned Parenthood, gay rights . .. voter rights . .. disability rights   â€¦     workersâ€™ rights   â€¦     And we havenâ€™t had much of a chance to talk about how I intend to take on the gun lobby. â€ Throughout the day Thursday, she lauded her volunteers and talked up her ground operation, the critical network of phone banks, neighborhood organizers and     efforts. That detailed organization is a Clinton hallmark but sorely lacking in the Trump campaign.  And she contrasted Trumpâ€™s â€œ  attacksâ€ with the soaring speech Michelle Obama gave on her behalf on Thursday. â€œIf you havenâ€™t seen it,â€ Clinton said, â€œyou need to see her speech in New Hampshire. â€ In fact, Obamaâ€™s oratory was a Clinton campaign highlight Thursday, a   widely tweeted and overwhelmingly celebrated defense of girlsâ€™ and womenâ€™s rights not to be demeaned or assaulted by anyone, not a construction worker on the street or the man who would be president. â€œI canâ€™t believe that Iâ€™m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,â€ Obama said, her voice shaking with emotion. â€œAnd I have to tell you that I canâ€™t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core. â€",896,383,"943648343598780416	943872504262774785	946796327526072320	946796470849585153	946796474305732608	946797272544763905	946799076816891904	946799184312786944	946834746176307200	946852844388327424	946895619100045313	947440659501408256	948269677364633601",fake

The move inspired much heated   rhetoric as the 1 October deadline drew near  â€”   chiefly from a group of US Republican governors, who backed unsuccessful   court action to delay the transition on the grounds that it wasnâ€™t in US interests. They failed. â€œStewardshipâ€ of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana) has now moved away from the National Telecommunications and Information Association (NTIA)  â€”   a branch of the US Department of Commerce  â€”   and over to an international â€œ  communityâ€. So has America really â€œgiven awayâ€ control of the internet? Some of the most public statements opposing the move came from a group of Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley, Ted Cruz and Roy Blunt.  â€œIt is profoundly disappointing that the Obama administration has decided to press on with its plan to relinquish United States oversight of crucial internet functions, even though Congress has not given its approval,â€ they said.  â€œFor years, there has been a bipartisan understanding that the Icann transition is premature and that critical questions remain unanswered about the influence of authoritarian regimes in internet governance, the protection of free speech, the effect on national security, and impacts on consumers, just to name a few. â€ However, many key players and analysts suggest that the newly implemented governance model for Icann (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) will actually strengthen the ability of the global community to challenge contentious decisions and ensure that control of the global internet address book never falls into the wrong hands. The NTIA, which is now out of the internet stewardship business, provided a detailed public assessment of the impact of the change in a statement on its NTIA website in August, detailing why it would be hard for a group of â€œbad actorsâ€ to take control of the process of managing internet names. â€œThe communityâ€™s new powers to challenge board decisions and enforce decisions in court protect against any one party or group of interests from inappropriately influencing Icann,â€ it stated. â€œIn conducting the review of the transition proposal, NTIA also retained an expert panel of corporate governance experts who reviewed the Icann accountability proposal, including assessing any risk of capture. In their assessment, the experts found the prospects for a takeover of Icann by a single government, a group of governments, or one or more economic actors to be extremely remote. â€ Dr Olivier MJ   who was a member of an Icann working group that developed the transition proposal, said the new arrangement also provides real teeth for resolving disputes.  â€œIt is a real improvement on the prior structure,â€ he said. â€œThe ability to overrule the Icann board was seen as a very important development because it was the solution to overturn decisions that might be taken by a rogue board, should it ever happen to become rogue in the future. â€ He said that   â€œgolden  â€ have been introduced that canâ€™t be changed solely by the board. â€œThe key to all of these   is to make sure that Icann, the organisation, is as stable as possible, as accountable as possible and as   as possible. â€ The symbolism of the move  â€”   not lost on activist Republicans  â€”   is as important as the practical changes in who controls the internet. The internet, and internet business, has steadily become more global and more critical to the lives of many people on the planet. With this gradual change came increasing pressure on the US to relinquish some managerial control. After many years of painstaking negotiation and diplomacy, that has now happened  â€”   though internet users wonâ€™t notice any difference at all. â€œThe function that was assumed by the US Department of Commerce was primarily a technical function and this has been replaced by a new set of service level expectations which are actually higher than any other prior agreements,â€ said  . â€œAs a result, the quality of service that will be offered by the Iana functions operator will be better than at any previous time in the history of the internet. â€ Milton Mueller, professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy and a principal of the Internet Governance Project, said that the real story of the Iana transition is that it provides a great example of how to create a global governance model.  â€œThe overall positive outcome is that weâ€™re creating a global governance regime that matches the global scope of the internet and we can extract ourselves from all the existing arrangements that are related to nation states,â€ he said. â€œWe donâ€™t want to put it into the intergovernmental politics of the UN. â€",310,35,"809618903055863808	809777131584569344	809800939532062720	809986391937519616	810000999456747521	810001189869789184	849374336280657922	849796909799579648	849797660039139328	849829224512987138	849855988102553601	850024842661216257	850029153877458944	850163816755318784	850355032772009984	850526079991336961",fake

It wasnâ€™t limited to online discourse or popular culture, either. Without so many people being convinced  â€”   being sold  â€”   that they were hard done by, we wouldnâ€™t have a Brexit, a Trump presidency, and perhaps the United Nations wouldnâ€™t be categorising Australiaâ€™s treatment of asylum seekers as violating the UN Convention Against Torture and in breach of international law. Thereâ€™s no doubt some people have lost out during three decades of neoliberal policies, itâ€™s just that many of the people shouting the loudest arenâ€™t among them. And so it is with nerd culture too.  Neuroscientist, former   advocate, and Big Bang Theory actor Mayim Bialik released a video blog called â€œHurts To Be Differentâ€ in which she complains about how hard it is to be a nerd. She argues that while â€œgeekâ€ and â€œnerdâ€ may be fashionable labels now, it doesnâ€™t make it any less hard to live the life of a quirky smart person interested in quirky smart person things, in a world of â€œcool kidsâ€. She mentions how different she is at least six times. The term â€œnerdsploitationâ€ was coined to describe alleged parallels with   exploitation films of the grindhouses and   of the past. It refers to engagement with subject material that cannot be described as being in good faith. We are laughing at the players in the film, not with them.  The conversation surrounding this term started gaining in popularity around 2013 with the release of a video questioning the ethics of the representation of geeky and nerdy stereotypes in reality shows and films. By presenting â€œnerdâ€ as an identity, Bialik and others are trying to attach themselves and the community to identity politics where oneâ€™s experiences (and oppression) inform their politics. But this only works if your identity actually is oppressed. Itâ€™s quite the misdirection. Not only is a little nerdery mainstream now, itâ€™s damn profitable and sends her  â€”   and anyone else starring in the latest works about nerds, geeks, outcasts or superheroes  â€”   a lot of big fat cheques. â€œNerdâ€ has reached a capitalist crescendo. Trying to shoehorn nerddom into identity politics shows callous ignorance for the systemic and daily oppression faced by genuinely marginalised people. Nerds arenâ€™t rejected for work, ignored by the courts or legislation or erased from popular culture. Despite this lack of actual oppression, terms like â€œnerdsploitationâ€ and  â€”   itâ€™s almost hard to believe  â€”   â€œnerd blackfaceâ€ are emerging. Letâ€™s be clear, nerds: you havenâ€™t faced centuries of racial oppression, violence, cultural appropriation or systemic discrimination for who you are. Cops arenâ€™t shooting you when your car breaks down because you can speak Klingon.  When we peel back why people feel defensive, bitter, or keen to take on the visage of the underdog, we can see what it really is: neediness. A desperate need to have our world view and choices validated. To have our sprawling mental databases of knowledge about our favourite media valued by others, even when those others can now quickly search their phones for such information. The good news is, if we let go of this persecution complex we can see that everyone is nerdy about something. If weâ€™re lucky enough, and open enough, we get to see someone in full flight talking about what they love. It truly is a thing of beauty, and if youâ€™re too needy about finding personal validation, youâ€™re going to miss your glimpse of it. Finding people who love the media you love has literally never been easier. Thereâ€™s an internet corner for every obscure fandom out there, wiki pages for the most complex of fantasy lore, and forums dedicated to teaching you how to make the best cosplay to pay homage to your favourite character.  We nerds are not as lonely as we once were, and we have to stop being afraid of acknowledging that lest we lose underdog status. Being into nerdy stuff can be awesome. Being nerdy about stuff is awesome. Find your people. Excise the gross ones. Share your passions proudly and with   enthusiasm.

Hahaha. There are no jobs in media anymore. Luckily, said reporter is played by Communityâ€™s Joel McHale playing a Gen   who canâ€™t deal with his millennial colleagues, who never leave their computer screens. Expect lots of â€œOh, kids todayâ€ jokes. With Stephen Fry and Superbadâ€™s Christopher   along for the ride, the cast is the main reason to tune in. CBS, Thursday 27 October at 8. 30pm ET, Tracey Ullmanâ€™s Show, For fans of the comedian, who has been doing a rogueâ€™s gallery of original characters and impersonations on US television for the past three decades, they will be happy that sheâ€™s back. This series actually ran in the UK back in January and it was the first time she had made something for British telly in 30 years. Sadly, it wasnâ€™t very well received. â€œItâ€™s not brave or funny enough, like a step backwards from Little Britain, 10 years after Little Britain,â€ the Guardianâ€™s Sam Wollaston wrote of the show. Ouch! At least her impressions of Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are spot on. HBO, Friday, 28 October at 11pm ET, Itâ€™s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, Before everyone was obsessed with dressing up as someone from this yearâ€™s election (sorry, your Melania Trump costume idea is not original no matter how you do it) we were all obsessed with the    Peanuts holiday special. You know, the one where Linus waits out in a pumpkin patch all night convinced that the spirit of Halloween will come and scare the bejesus out of him. Watch it again or introduce someone a bit younger to the tradition. Itâ€™s paired with a   cartoon from Snoopy and the gang called Youâ€™re Not Elected, Charlie Brown. God, is everyone obsessed with politics right now? ABC, Friday 28 October 28, at 8pm ET,  Good Girls Revolt  Imagine if Mad Men were only about Peggy Olson and it focused on the newspapers that carried the ads rather than the ads themselves. Oh, and itâ€™s based on true events. Then youâ€™d have Good Girls Revolt, Amazonâ€™s newest show, inspired by a real lawsuit in which female journalists at Newsweek sued their bosses in the 60s over equal treatment in the newsroom. (Thereâ€™s even a book written about it in case the Amazon show convinces you to make an Amazon order.) Anna Camp, Genevieve Angelson and Erin Darke play the women who square off against their sexist boss (Jim Belushi). Mamie Gummer has a small role as Nora Ephron, who worked at the magazine before she become a Hollywood legend. Amazon, Friday 28 October, Rectify, There used to be a promo for this show that ran on Sundance TV in which the main character, Daniel Holden (Aden Young) was lying in a bathtub watching water drip out of the drain. That is a perfect way to encapsulate this moody, moving, brilliant show that sometimes moves more slowly than a slug on a heavy dose of sedatives. Daniel is released from death row after 20 years when some DNA evidence suggests he may not have raped and murdered his high school girlfriend. The fourth and final season of this drama follows Danielâ€™s long journey trying to acclimate to the world and his family trying to acclimate to him. The premiere is on Sundance TV on Wednesday 26 October at 10pm ET and the previous seasons are all on Netflix. While it might be a little dense for a binge, youâ€™re going to want to give this gorgeous and underrated show the goodbye it deserves.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa) says the cityâ€™s main transit agency and the union representing about 4, 700 workers reached an agreement early Monday. Septa board chairman Pasquale Deon said it is a fair deal that provides â€œwage increases, pension improvements, and maintains healthcare coverage levels while addressing rising costsâ€. The deal is still subject to ratification by union members and must be approved by the Septa board. Officials said subway service would be the first to return and that some bus service could be available in time for the evening rush, but that it usually would take 24 hours for full service to return. The workers with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority walked out after midnight on Tuesday, 1 November, over issues including pension benefits and the amount of time off given to drivers between shifts. The result has been traffic gridlock at morning and evening rush hours jammed and delayed regional rail service and higher absenteeism at the cityâ€™s high schools. Some officials were concerned that the strike could dampen voter turnout if it continued through election day. The city of Philadelphia had filed a motion in state court seeking an injunction to temporarily halt the strike for election day so residents can get to the polls to vote. The court had been expected to hear the cityâ€™s motion Monday morning. Democratic city leaders had worried that if the strike continued through election day, some voters wouldnâ€™t have been able to get to the polls because they will be spending so much time getting to and from work. Pennsylvania is a battleground state, and the vote in overwhelmingly Democratic Philadelphia is critically important to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as she battles Republican Donald Trump. Democratic governor Tom Wolf on Sunday said he intended to file a legal document in support of an injunction request filed by Septa. The transit agency argues the walkout endangers public health and safety as well as the right of residents to vote in Tuesdayâ€™s general election. The union has accused Septa of relying on the courts to end the strike rather than bargaining. â€œThe strike has been devastating for so many individuals and their families and has created extreme hardships for the city and for businesses,â€ Wolf said in a statement. â€œThe time for it to end is now. â€ The walkout is the ninth since 1975 by the city transit union. The last one, in 2009, lasted six days, but some have lasted for weeks. Septa provides rides for nearly 60, 000 public, private and charter school students.",50,556,"939200643465728005	939213893968293888	939250622020304896	939336691453693952	939384938402648064	939403816830734336	939743551881019393	939749394701676544	939803185270706176	940027198047686656	940064742638419969	940070162488737794	940101603247341568	940126266878967808	940134074785714176	940283954208301061	940332536135389184	940334703524986880	940404705758498817	940419133040082944	940743613478293504	940930684633227264	941320586311143424	941755715932315648	953060370263965698",fake

The reports were later determined to be unfounded and the New York airport was given the  . Port Authority police said they received reports of shots fired at Terminal 8 near the departures area at about 9. 30pm on Sunday (1. 30am BST). Police said they closed Terminal 1 following additional reports of shots fired. However, in a briefing early on Monday, Joe Pentangelo, a Port Authority spokesman, said: â€œAt this time, no firearm, rounds, shell casings or other evidence of shots fired has been found. â€ The New York police departmentâ€™s head of special operations tweeted that nothing suspicious had been found in a search of the terminals.  A senior law enforcement official told NBC the security alert had been triggered when a woman coming off a plane reported hearing gunshots in Terminal 8.  One official said the noise could have been cheering and banging while passengers watched the Olympics.  The security alert led to travel chaos for thousands. The Federal Aviation Administration announced a â€œfull ground stopâ€ on all air traffic arriving at JFK until 11. 30pm. Some flights were diverted and tracking website Flightradar said delays in the area were increasing. An expressway approaching JFK also was shut down. Passengers were allowed back into some terminals and flights began departing again at about midnight. Images posted on social media during the evacuation showed scores of people standing outside the terminals.  Travellers who had been evacuated said police told them it was â€œnot safeâ€ to stay inside.  People inside Terminal 8 described panic when the evacuation order was given. One passenger onboard a plane that had landed at JFK said the aircraft was being held on the tarmac due to an emergency. JFK, which has six terminals  â€”   two have previously been demolished  â€”   is the busiest international air passenger gateway into the US.

politifact15331,https://dailyworldupdate.us/2018/04/29/cnn-shocks-america-fires-journalist-who-made-fun-of-sarah-sanders-face/,"CNN Shocks America, FIRES ‘Journalist’ Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders’ Face","Speaking to Siri Hustvedt in her Brooklyn brownstone not long before the American presidential election, conversation naturally turns to Hillary Clinton. â€œFor someone so accomplished . .. who performs as superbly as Hillary Clinton does, to be constantly criticised,â€ Hustvedt muses. â€œWhen she performs brilliantly in a debate, they call her  . I have never heard anything like that said about a man. â€ Hustvedt knows something about being an accomplished woman, and having things said about her work that would never be said about a manâ€™s. I am here to talk about her new book of essays, A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women. One of them, â€œNo Competitionâ€ catalogues her experiences as â€œa woman writer married to a man writer (Paul Auster)â€. A journalist insists that Auster must have taught her psychoanalysis and neuroscience. A publisher magnanimously instructs her to â€œkeep writingâ€ when she has already published three novels. A fan asks if her husband has written sections of her most recent novel, The Blazing World. During my meeting with Hustvedt, Auster is just a low murmur moving around elsewhere in the house. â€œHe is doing an interview upstairs,â€ Hustvedt explains. â€œI think for the first time in our history of 35 years together, we have books coming out one month apart. â€ We donâ€™t mention him again. Hustvedt says she often encounters surprise that she is, above all, a person interested in ideas. â€œWomen who write books about ideas are not instantly anointed in the way that men are. You get a lot of criticism for being too intellectual, too cerebral. But I donâ€™t see those same complaints addressed to male writers. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re out there, but not to the same degree. â€ A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women seems likely to inspire more people to call Hustvedt â€œcerebralâ€ though in this context as a compliment. Somewhat unusually in a publishing age characterised by slim essay collections about personal experience, Hustvedtâ€™s book is nearly 600 pages of learned commentary on everything from the nature of literature to neuroscience. It takes in a remark Karl Ove Knausgaard once made to her  â€”   women writers, he said, were â€œno competitionâ€  â€”   as well as the work of the   philosopher Margaret Cavendish. The centrepiece is a   meditation on â€œThe Delusions of Certaintyâ€ that ranges from the science of perception to   to the history of psychiatry. Hustvedt has never been a writer of narrow or fleeting interests. â€œThese are questions I have been addressing in both my fiction and nonfiction for a very long time,â€ she says. â€œItâ€™s about a long, long accumulation of knowledge, and changing my mind, rethinking, discovering another beat I hadnâ€™t been thinking about before. Or discovering some earlier thought thatâ€™s wrong. â€ It should be said that this is also a pretty good description of Hustvedtâ€™s conversational style. She makes a statement, then revises it, and revises it again. Itâ€™s not that she is uncertain of what she thinks itâ€™s that sheâ€™s precise. Hustvedt was born in Minnesota, in 1955, to a Norwegian mother and an American father of Norwegian descent. As a child, she spent time in Norway, and graduated with a degree there in her teens. (For days after our interview I find myself trying to emulate her correct pronunciation of the name â€œKnausgaardâ€  â€”   something like â€œ  â€). She says she became a feminist at 14, â€œcarrying around my Sisterhood Is Powerful and Kate Millett, and trying to read Simone de Beauvoir and it was that terrible edition [of The Second Sex] translated by the zoologist [Howard M Parshley]â€. In the 1980s, Hustvedt had her poetry published and got a PhD in English literature from Columbia, writing her dissertation on Dickens. She then published several novels, each to greater acclaim than the last. But the differential treatment she received as a writer and thinker who also happened to be a woman became an abiding theme in her work, too. In The Blazing World, the main character is a female artist whose work is largely neglected in her lifetime, while her husband, an art dealer, is relatively successful. â€œIn that effete microcosm,â€ writes Hustvedt, â€œit is fair to say Felix had been a giant, dealer to the stars, and I, Gargantuaâ€™s artist wife. â€ The resurrection of female intellectuals from obscurity is a preoccupation of Hustvedtâ€™s. At one point she begins to quiz me about the mathematician Emmy Noether. â€œShe did work in symmetry in mathematics that then became adopted in physics,â€ she tells me. â€œExtremely important thinker. Praised by Einstein. Praised by, I think, Heisenberg. The stellar figures of   physics thought Noether was a genius. Does Noether set off bells in your head? No?â€ The Blazing World was generally well received, but there were â€œquite a few reviews that said, â€˜But sheâ€™s not likableâ€™. Well neither is Raskolnikov,â€ Hustvedt says. â€œThis [criticism] is so much more aimed at a womanâ€™s book than a manâ€™s book. Where did that come from? What kind of a criterion is that for a work of literature?â€ Not that she is fond of hard definitions of literature. In another essay she alludes to James Wood, particularly his book How Fiction Works, with dismay and disdain. â€œItâ€™s incomprehensible to me that anyone who has read a great many books could come to any conclusion about how books should be written. â€ She talks about telling a prize committee that in the whole history of literature there has never been one clear formula for what makes a good book. â€œGoya said â€˜There are no rules in painting.â€™ And I think there are no rules. â€ Certainly Hustvedt has not been observing any rules herself. As well as writing she has a burgeoning career as a thinker in psychiatry and neuroscience. Her longstanding interest in those subjects took off after the success of The Shaking Woman, a hybrid memoir and intellectual investigation she published in 2009. The departure point was her own illness  â€”   a nervous disorder that caused her body to convulse and gave her migraines  â€”   but it quickly expanded into an inquiry into the nature of the self that encompassed both contemporary research and the work of   Charcot, a   neurologist who studied hysteria. This sideline in science has been transformative. â€œYou can sit and argue about whether or not you like a writer deep into the night, and you can make arguments about why, and at the same time itâ€™s not like finding the fault line in somebodyâ€™s argument about the predictive brain. â€ The problem is that science tends to appeal to a limited audience. â€œPeople who are working in neuroscience, they can see whatâ€™s original. People outside of those worlds, they donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m original. Where Iâ€™m shocking people. They canâ€™t see. â€ For Hustvedt the gulf between science and the humanities is something of a tragedy. In the introduction to A Woman Looking at Men   â€¦     she laments that â€œI have witnessed scenes of mutual incomprehension or, worse,    hostility. â€ She devoted her work in the sciences to drawing connections between what you could call humanistic ideas and scientific findings. She thinks that gender bias could be explained by way of the science of perception. â€œThe brain as an organ of prediction is founded on prior expectations,â€ she explains. And our prior expectations are often set up to disadvantage women: we donâ€™t associate them with artistic greatness. The connections between body and mind fascinate her, too. For example, lately Hustvedt has become â€œvery interested in the placentaâ€. It has only been lightly studied, even though scientists refer to it as a kind of â€œthird brainâ€ in the process of human development, but Hustvedtâ€™s interest is also philosophical. â€œWhat does that literal mediator, that is the beginning of every human being, have to do with our later development? The idea of mediation is there in utero as an actual physical organ. This has to have an effect on what we become. â€ Some of this abstracted talk may sound alienating, but in person Hustvedtâ€™s engagement has an infectious quality. It reminds me of something she wrote about another apparently intimidating writer, Susan Sontag. â€œIn every conversation I had with her I found myself amazed at the certitude of her opinions,â€ Hustvedt writes. In conversations with Hustvedt, the observation is slightly different: itâ€™s hard not to be amazed at the richness, the texture of her views. â€œIâ€™m always doing this tug of war between different positions. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t have a position. But I really do not have a final position on a great many profound questions,â€ she says, later adding, â€œI am alarmed by all kinds of solidified knowledge. â€ In the weeks after our interview, one particular piece of knowledge did firm up: Hillary Clinton would not be the president of the United States Donald Trump would be. Hustvedt had repeatedly told me that the election was â€œcharged with misogynyâ€. So how does she feel about things now? â€œHe was elected because his exploitation of the big lie technique worked, because misogyny is alive and well among women and men,â€ she says. â€œHe was elected because, as a study at Yale demonstrated, when faced with an identical description of an ambitious politician, both men and women respond to a female candidate with feelings of â€˜moral outrageâ€™ but have no such feelings for a power seeking male candidate. â€ It goes back to what she has been saying about the science of perception, the kinds of expectations we have for men versus those for women. â€œIf sheâ€™s emotional, then sheâ€™s like a woman. If sheâ€™s not emotional, then sheâ€™s cold and heartless,â€ she says of Clinton. â€œWhereas Trump actually has played the female role: the out of control, angry hysteric. And yet, he has been perceived as a robust, masculine figure by a large portion of the US public. The possibilities for a woman are infinitely more narrow. â€",549,722,9.91E+17,fake

The officer was making a traffic stop Friday afternoon in the village of Hatch, about 40 miles   of Las Cruces, when a passenger got out of the vehicle and started firing, Dona Ana County sheriffâ€™s spokeswoman Kelly Jameson said in a news release.  The suspects drove south on Interstate 25 at speeds up to 100mph, then stopped at a rest stop near Radium Springs, where one of them carjacked a parked Chevrolet Cruze. Jameson said that carâ€™s owner also was shot.  Sheriffâ€™s deputies spotted the Cruze, pursued it and were able to slow it down with â€œstop sticksâ€ the suspect crashed the vehicle into a pile of wood and briefly barricaded himself in the car before surrendering to sheriffâ€™s deputies, Jameson said. The suspect had a gunshot wound to the right thigh, she said.  Meanwhile, deputies tracked down the other two suspects in Rincon after being alerted by a passerby of two men â€œacting suspiciousâ€ in the area, the sheriffâ€™s spokeswoman said.      Hatch officer Jose Chavez, who had been shot in the neck, died at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, authorities say. Chavez had been with the Hatch police for two years.  The motorist, who was not identified, shot in the carjacking also was taken to the hospital his condition wasnâ€™t immediately available.  Authorities didnâ€™t identify the three suspects or the injured motorist.  The Chillicothe Gazette in Ohio reported Saturday that James D Nelson II and Jesse D Hanes have been taken into custody in New Mexico on warrants in the 25 July shooting death of an Ohio man, and are believed to be involved in the New Mexico officerâ€™s killing.

On Twitter, Carney posted a screenshot of a typed statement saying: â€œIâ€™m ashamed of myself that I could say such things and Iâ€™ve been trying to account for what they say about me.

DO YOU SUPPORT THIS?,"After waiting 58 years to return to a major tournament, Wales made up for lost time with a thrilling victory that gets their Euro 2016 campaign off to the best possible start. It was a dramatic match that swung one way and then the other before Hal   who is currently out of contract with Reading, upstaged Gareth Bale to emerge as an unlikely hero. Introduced as a   substitute, and at a time when the game was in danger of slipping away from Wales after Ondrej Duda had come off the bench to equalise for Slovakia with his first touch,   steered home a   shot to spark wild celebrations on the pitch and in the stands. It was only his third international goal and, with only nine minutes remaining, could not have been timed better. That Joe Ledley, who broke his leg five weeks ago to the day, was involved in the buildup to the defining moment in the match only added to the sense of satisfaction for Wales at the final whistle. Bale flung his head back and roared into the sky at the end of an absorbing game of football that left Chris Colemanâ€™s players looking physically and emotionally drained. The sight of three points on the board should help to accelerate their recovery and, given the new format that opens the door for four   teams to qualify for the knockout stage, Wales could be forgiven for thinking they already have one foot in the last 16. At the very least, they can go into the â€œBattle of Britainâ€ with England in Lens on Thursday full of confidence and with the pressure off. Bale, as ever, delivered for his country, yet this was not one of those days when it was all about the worldâ€™s most expensive footballer. The Real Madrid forward scored a superb   to put Wales ahead and had a powerful header saved in the second half, but for long periods of the game Bale was on the periphery, bereft of service and isolated in attack, no more so than in the   spell at the start of the second half when Slovakia took control of the game. With the excellent Marek Hamsik becoming more and more influential and Wales unable to retain possession, Dudaâ€™s   equaliser had been coming. The worry for Wales was that Slovakia were not finished there, which is why Colemanâ€™s decision to bring on Ledley and   was so crucial, not just in terms of their contribution to the winning goal but also to break up the rhythm of the game. There was also something else that happened around the time of those substitutions that captured the mood on this historical day for Wales. With the team looking like they were running on empty, the 25, 000 Wales fans inside the stadium broke into a stirring rendition of the national anthem. Little wonder that Bale said afterwards that it felt like a home game for Wales. It was quite an occasion for Danny Ward, the    Liverpool goalkeeper who was drafted into the team on the eve of the match after Wayne Hennessey was forced to pull out after suffering a back spasm. Ward made his Wales debut only in March and had never previously started a game for his country, but he is entitled to be proud of his performance, as well as a touch relieved that Adam Nemecâ€™s late header struck the upright. Wales will feel that they did enough to deserve that break. After a nervous start, when Hamsik slalomed through the Wales defence and was denied a brilliant individual goal only by Ben Daviesâ€™s superb clearance, Colemanâ€™s side started to move the ball with more belief and grew into the game. Baleâ€™s goal was a beauty and there was a sense of inevitability about what was going to happen from the moment that Jonny Williams was brought down by Patrik Hrosovsky 30 yards from goal. Matus Kozacik, the Slovakia goalkeeper, lined up his wall but made the fatal mistake of taking a step to his left just as Bale started his   leaving a gaping hole on the other side of the goal. Bale, with a dipping   thumped the ball into that area and, although it was not in the corner, Kozacik had too much ground to make up to try and get across his goal. Wales were aggrieved they never had a chance to double their advantage from the penalty spot when Martin Skrtel, trying to shepherd the ball out of play, elbowed Jonny Williams in the face. That incident went unpunished, unlike the poor defending that Duda exposed to equalise shortly after he came on. Robert Mak got away from Aaron Ramsey and Dave Edwards far too easily on the Slovakia right and the wingerâ€™s neat   was dispatched by Duda, who drilled a low shot across Ward and into the far corner. Bale and Ramsey both had headed opportunities either side of Dudaâ€™s goal but Slovakia also continued to threaten as the game became stretched. Wales badly needed some inspiration and they got it via the substitutesâ€™ bench. Ledley, on for Edwards, threaded the ball into the feet of Ramsey, who nicked it past Skrtel and, a little fortuitously, into the path of  .

politifact15287,http://nrtonline.info/breaking-british-intelligence-seizes-clinton-foundation-warehouse-400-million-in-cash/,"BREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash – NRTOnline","Having first announced he was retiring from boxing on Monday, Tyson Fury then claimed he was â€œhere to stayâ€ just hours later after an apparent change of heart. The reigning world heavyweight champion, who last month pulled out of his proposed rematch with Wladimir Klitschko citing mental health issues, tweeted on Monday that he will retire despite never having defended his titles. He said on Twitter that â€œBoxing is the saddest thing I ever took part in,â€ before claiming it was â€œall a pile of shitâ€. In the same tweet, he then apparently hung up his gloves: â€œIâ€™m the greatest,  Iâ€™m also retired, so go suck a dick, happy daysâ€. However the    then released another tweet three hours later which reversed his decision, while also criticising the media for reporting his earlier announcement. â€œHahahaha u think you will get rid of the GYPSYKING that easy! !! Iâ€™m here to stay. #TheGreatest just shows u what the Medea [sic] are like. Tut tut,â€ he wrote. Peter Fury, his trainer and uncle, said last Sunday that the boxer is receiving professional help for issues that have arisen as a result of what he called a â€œ â€ against him following his victory. On Friday it was reported that Fury had failed a drugs test after a random urine test on 22 September tested positive for the substance benzoylecgonine, the central compound found in cocaine. Fury pulled out of the rematch against Klitschko a day after the test. Fury also responded to the reports about that positive test on Twitter by posting a cryptic photograph. It showed Al Pacinoâ€™s character from the film Scarface, Tony Montana, sitting with a pile of cocaine on a table in front of him. Fury superimposed his face on to the picture, with the hashtag #Tysonmontana, which did little to clear up the confusion surrounding the reports. Fury, who was stripped of his IBF title when it became clear he planned to face Klitschko again instead of the mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov, had postponed the first defence of his WBO and WBA titles from July because of an ankle injury. By that point he had already offended many by making sexist, homophobic and antisemitic comments, but he apologised for those and insisted he is â€œin no way a racist or bigotâ€. Since his ankle injury, Furyâ€™s career  â€”   which held such promise in his position as the worldâ€™s leading heavyweight  â€”   has suffered significant damage. Reports emerged that alleged he had failed a test for the banned substance nandrolone, allegations he denied and responded to through his legal team, who spoke of plans to sue UK   (Ukad). He missed a press conference last month to promote his rematch with Klitschko, when his manager, Mick Hennessy, said his car had broken down and his mobile phone had run out of battery. At that time Klitschko cast doubt over the 29 October date taking place, with a hearing for his alleged doping violation scheduled for November, before insisting he was prepared to wait for their rematch. Fury then withdrew from the fight amid doubts over whether he would consequently be stripped of his WBO and WBA titles, and most recently it was reported he had tested positive for cocaine. It remains to be seen whether, as a   and talented fighter, he can be tempted to return to a sport in which he retains a high value. The revelation will simplify the dilemma faced by sanctioning bodies the WBO and WBA. In retirement, Furyâ€™s titles routinely become vacant, increasing the likelihood Klitschko will fight for them. Early indications suggest Anthony Joshua could fight Klitschko for one or more of Furyâ€™s belts in what would be an unexpected   world heavyweight fight potentially slated for

politifact15386,http://hotgazette.com/rudy-giuliani/official-rudy-giuliani-officially-resigns-trumps-legal-team-on-its-last-leg/,"OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Officially Resigns, Trump’s Legal Team on Its Last Leg","Gennifer Flowers has not been â€œformally invitedâ€ by the Trump campaign to attend Mondayâ€™s first presidential debate, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on Sunday, adding: â€œI canâ€™t believe how easily the Clinton campaign was baited. â€ In response, Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said the Flowers story was â€œa warning sign about [Trumpâ€™s] bullying tactics that make him unfit to be presidentâ€. Trump appeared to invite Flowers, who had a sexual liaison with Bill Clinton, on Saturday, in an exchange of tweets with the billionaire Mark Cuban, a Clinton supporter and Trump antagonist who said he had been invited to attend the Hofstra University debate. Flowers subsequently tweeted that she was in Trumpâ€™s â€œcornerâ€ and would â€œdefinitely be at the debateâ€. BuzzFeed News reported that her assistant said in an email Flowers would attend and the New York Times reported that Flowers confirmed that in a text message, saying: â€œYes I will be there. â€ Conway appeared on Sunday on CNNâ€™s State of the Union. Asked if she could confirm Flowersâ€™ attendance, she said: â€œNo, I canâ€™t confirm that and I canâ€™t believe how easily the Clinton campaign was baited. â€ Flowers, she said, â€œhad not been formally invited. I donâ€™t expect her to be there as a guest of the Trump campaign.  â€œIt seems odd,â€ she added, that the Clinton campaign would give the story â€œlife and breathâ€. Speaking to ABCâ€™s This Week, Conway repeated her contention that the Clinton campaign had started the row by inviting Cuban and elaborated on her claim about â€œbaitingâ€ criticising the release of a statement on the subject on Saturday night.  In that statement, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said: â€œHillary Clinton plans on using the debate to discuss the issues that make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. Itâ€™s not surprising that Donald Trump has chosen a different path. â€ Conway also repeated that Flowers had not been invited by the campaign, but added that she could be at the debate â€œas a paying member of the publicâ€. On Fox News Sunday, Trump   pick Mike Pence was more emphatic, saying: â€œGennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night. â€ Pence also attacked Cuban, who owns the NBAâ€™s Dallas Mavericks, saying he had â€œbeen out there saying some pretty tough stuff about my running mate   â€¦     [He] knows about as much about national security as I do about professional basketballâ€. On NBCâ€™s Meet the Press, retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser, held the line, saying Cuban was â€œnot a legitimate personâ€. Flynn was less decisive about Flowers, saying only: â€œWeâ€™ll wait to see what happens tomorrow night. â€ Following Conway on CNN, Mook said the Flowers story was indicative of Trumpâ€™s temperamental instability and unsuitability for the White House. â€œNobody knows which Donald Trump is going to show up to this debate,â€ he said, â€œand in fact his erratic temperament has been discussed a lot around the debate, and I would argue that is why he is not fit and prepared to be president. â€ Conway said Trump â€œhad no planâ€ to attack Clinton in the debate about her husbandâ€™s infidelity, echoing remarks by the candidate himself earlier this week, and said: â€œMr Trump will answer the questions as asked by moderator Lester Holt. â€ Trumpâ€™s frequent attacks on other people were â€œcounterpunchesâ€ to attacks on him, she said, as he had â€œa right to defend himselfâ€. Mook said: â€œI think the fact that Trump is spending the hours before the debate on this sort of thing is indicative of the kind of leader and the kind of president he would be. Itâ€™s a warning sign before the debate has even started about [Trumpâ€™s] bullying tactics that make him unfit to be president. â€ Clinton would seek in the debate an â€œunfiltered opportunityâ€ to address the American people, Mook said, repeating campaign claims that the Democratic candidate would not be treated fairly by moderators and saying he was â€œvery concerned that Donald Trump will be graded on a curveâ€ and allowed to â€œfly off the handleâ€ rather than address specific plans and policies.  Speaking to ABC, he added that the campaign did not want Clinton â€œto have to play traffic cop   â€¦     having to spend the whole debate correcting the recordâ€. On CNN, Conway refused to reveal what was said between Trump and the Texas senator Ted Cruz, who endorsed the nominee on Friday after having held out since a bruising primary in which Trump labelled him â€œLyinâ€™ Tedâ€ was critical of Cruzâ€™s wifeâ€™s looks and linked his father to the assassination of John F Kennedy. â€œI can tell you we are thrilled to have the endorsement of Senator Cruz,â€ she said. â€œTogether [he and Trump] really do represent a large part of the Republican party. â€ Speaking in Austin, Texas, on Saturday, Cruz said his decision was rooted in the need to stop Clinton becoming president, but he refused to say if Trump was fit for the job. Bill Clinton initially denied Flowersâ€™ 1992 claim that they had had a long affair, but admitted in a 1998 deposition in a sexual harassment suit that he had a single sexual encounter with Flowers. In 1999, Flowers opened a defamation suit against Hillary Clinton and two Clinton aides, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. It was eventually dismissed. News of Flowersâ€™ possible attendance at the first debate came nine years after she told the Associated Press â€œI canâ€™t help but want to support my own genderâ€ and â€œI donâ€™t have any interest whatsoever in getting back out there and bashing Hillary Clinton. â€",326,742,,fake
politifact15109,https://www.nyfoxnews.co/michelle-obama-just-received-life-shattering-news-from-the-doctor/,Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The Doctor,"The critically acclaimed,   comic series The Legend of Wonder Woman has been cancelled by DC Comics, because of what a spokesperson for DC called â€œa challenging relationshipâ€ with the husband and wife team behind the series. Artist Ray Dillon and writer Renae De Liz had created nine issues of The Legend of Wonder Woman, telling the story of the Amazonian from her origins on the planet Themyscira to arriving on Earth to become a superhero. A   series, a collected edition was released in hardback on 13 December. DC had previously announced that the series would continue with a second part to come out in 2017. De Liz told Nerdist. com as recently as last week that more work was coming, saying it would be about a Wonder Woman who â€œstill struggles with trying to find her place beyond the hero in her new worldâ€. Since the cancellation was announced, fans have been wondering whether it was due to poor sales, or studio sexism towards Wonder Woman. However, the DC spokesperson told the Guardian that though â€œwe loved the book and we were very excited to work on the collected volumeâ€ the studio was concerned about Dillonâ€™s public comments about other teams at DC on social media. In a series of   tweets, preserved online on Bleeding Cool, Dillon criticised the writing in another DC series, Wonder Woman: Earth One, and complained when DC approved future volumes of Earth One while he was waiting to hear about the future of his own series. On hearing the news that Kevin Grevioux had been confirmed to write a series about the Amazonians, titled The Odyssey of the Amazons, Dillon alleged that he and De Liz had already pitched a similar idea to DC but had never heard back about it. De Liz also complained, tweeting that while she was happy the series would happen, she â€œfelt I could have added a lot as a female creatorâ€. â€œIt is an unfortunate situation. We tried hard to make it work,â€ the DC spokesperson said. Dillon said: â€œI wish no negativity on anyone, and support DC and the people who work there 100%. Iâ€™m just looking forward to getting through the hurdle of sudden loss of finances during a crucial time and moving forward to an exciting, productive new year. â€ He said that he and De Liz were now focusing on their creation, the superhero Lady Powerpunch. When the cancellation was announced on Thursday, De Liz took to Twitter to say she was â€œsurprised and devastatedâ€ the series had been cancelled. She also revealed that she is pregnant with her fourth child, tweeting that the announcement had fallen at a difficult time of year, just before Christmas. After being encouraged by fans on Twitter, De Liz set up a GoFundMe page to accept donations for her family. It has already raised more than $5, 000 (Â£4, 000) at time of writing, exceeding its initial $2, 000 goal in less than 24 hours. More than 400 fans have signed a petition on Change. org, demanding that DC reinstate the series. In an update, De Liz thanked supporters and said the money would not only help her family at Christmas, but also gave her and Dillon more creative freedom. â€œNo matter what we do, Iâ€™ll always be pushing for creating adventures for all ages that are uplifting, fun, and full of examples of diverse, strong characters, especially for young girls to look up to, and show them that they too are capable of doing anything,â€ she wrote. DC has historically been sensitive to public criticism from their creators. In 2009, Justice League of America writer Dwayne McDuffie was fired after making comments on a DC Comics discussion board about his frustrations with the project, while Fairest writer Chris Roberson was told specifically that he had lost his role on the DC title for â€œone tweet which questioned the ethics of the companyâ€. It has not been a good week for the   character, who turned 75 this year: Wonder Woman also lost her job as the UN ambassador for empowering girls and women after less than two months. More than 45, 000 people signed a petition criticising the appointment, saying: â€œIt is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls. â€",469,187,"970400155357798400	970400532723478528	970401425242099713	970402224995217408	970402307362906112	970402899367989251	970453863424651265	970479647279415296	970481504429248512	970481640584699909	970483987192930306	970534684777238529	970534709724831744	970556638410125312	970635968553324544	970650578157277184	970678748751294465	970733945628192768	970747688621891584	970748466350739459	970771766187560960	970776626630885381	970820934549549061	970862032529522688	970875792266874880	970930165898342400	971017896909594625	971058516923318272	971058646070198272	971075752576864259	971079837078212610	971102956320907265	971440787736100866	972249289073287168	972305527190573056	972939489302777857	973004870788591617	973197873348251649	976572679238094850	979580600750432261	979809594074689536	985693440796168194	987834721504645120	989623057219248128	992415247628554241	994819716333080576	997294885559513088	998945400106242049	998952972162912256	998961203803193347	998973050526814208	998975884265652224	999772774506909696	1000151338209067008	1006895735420473344	1006899125558734849	1008557156499705856	1011771544740212736	1020705514265620480	1025992339611734016	1040029471577919488	1050071874707709952	1050198269652021248	1051100963380101120	1053306999037935619	1053827413019422720	1055229937408466944	1055953948941713408	1056716798677188608	1065663129466621952",fake

Like a brisk tennis game or a summer track meet, something performed in daylight between competitors. The cheap mattress bounced. She liked to do it more than once, and he was usually able to comply. Bourbon was his gasoline. Between sessions, he poured it at the counter while she lay panting on the sheets. Sweat burnished her body. The lean neck. The surprisingly full breasts. He would down another glass and return. He closed his eyes and heard himself make a gurgling sound. And as his trousers slipped down his legs all the burdens of his life to date seemed to fall away from him he tipped back his head and faced up into the darkness beneath the ceiling, and for one blessed moment he felt as if he could understand the things of this world in all their immeasurable beauty. How strange they are, he thought, life and all of these things. Then he felt Anezka slide down before him to the floor, felt her hands grab his naked buttocks and draw him to her. â€œCome, sonny boy!â€ he heard her whisper, and with a smile he let go. The walkway to the terminal was all carpet, no oxygen. Dilly bundled Finn into the first restroom on offer, locked the cubicle door and pulled at his leather belt. â€œYouâ€™re beautiful,â€ she told him, going down on to her haunches and unzipping him. He watched her passport rise gradually out of the back pocket of her jeans in time with the rhythmic bobbing of her buttocks as she sucked him. He arched over her back and took hold of the passport before it landed on the pimpled floor. Despite the immediate circumstances, human nature obliged him to take a look at her passport photo.  When his hand goes to my breasts, my feet are envious. I slide my hands down his back, all along his spine, rutted with bone like mud ridges in a dry field, to the audacious swell below. His finger is inside me, his thumb circling, and I spill like grain from a bucket. He is panting, still running his race. I laugh at the incongruous size of him, sticking to his stomach and escaping from the springing hair below.  Once they were in that room, Jason had slammed the door and devoured her with his mouth, his hands, which were everywhere. As if he were ravenous. And she remembered standing in front of him, her dress a puddle on the floor, and how sheâ€™d started to shake, her knees knocking together, like she was a virgin, like this was the first time. Because had she allowed herself to hope, this was what she wouldâ€™ve hoped for. And now here it was. And that was terrifying. Jason had taken her hand and placed it over his bare chest, to his heart, which was pounding wildly, in tandem with hers. Sheâ€™d thought he was just excited, turned on. It had not occurred to her that he might be terrified, too. She pushed on my hips, an order that thrust me in. I entered her. Not only my prick, but the whole of me entered her, into her guts, into her darkness, eyes wide open, seeing nothing. My whole body had gone inside her. I went in with her thrusts and stayed still. While I got used to the quiet and the pulsing of my blood in my ears and nose, she pushed me out a little, then in again. She did it again and again, holding me with force and moving me to the rhythm of the surf. She wiggled her breasts beneath my hands and intensified the pushing. I went in up to my groin and came out almost entirely. My body was her gearstick.",57,352,"774381500196200448	774937464716795904	775260193768689664	775393640407371777	775393638704484352	803463549754494976	823942121120002048	826639162711302144	830989818494668801",fake
politifact14052,www.firstpost.com/world/donald-trump-to-issue-an-executive-order-to-ban-facebook-across-us-3363348.html,Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across US,"A new video showing the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, filmed by his wife, shows police warning Scott to â€œdrop the gunâ€ as his wife screams that he did not have a weapon.  Scott, 43, was killed by police in Charlotte, North Carolina, after he was mistaken for a suspect in another incident. Police have refused to release police body camera footage of the incident. His death has sparked days of unrest in the city, during which one man was shot and later died.  The video does not show the moment of Scottâ€™s death, or whether he had a weapon. The Scott family insists he was unarmed.  In the video, released by the Scott family attorneys to the New York Times and NBC News, Rakeyia Scott can be heard yelling to a group of police, â€œDonâ€™t shoot him, donâ€™t shoot him, he has no weapon,â€ while officers yell to â€œdrop the gunâ€. Soon after, four shots are fired and police are seen gathered around Scottâ€™s body, lying on the ground.  â€œHe better not be fucking dead,â€ Rakeyia Scott shouts, standing a short distance away. â€œHe better live. â€ According to NBC, police have previously said that a still photo taken from a video shows a pistol near Scottâ€™s feet. Neither that photo nor the familyâ€™s video are perfectly clear, but they seem to contradict each other. In the familyâ€™s video, which includes footage from before, during, and after the shooting, there is no gun visible. Two of the officers at the scene can be seen in the familyâ€™s video picking up unidentifiable black objects from the ground at separate points in the clip. Further complicating the situation, however, these objects appear to be in different locations to the object that is visible in the photo. The videoâ€™s release follows a police announcement on Friday that a suspect was arrested in the deadly shooting of Justin Carr, a    protester shot Wednesday night during violent demonstrations.  Police chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference that a video led police to arrest the suspect on Friday morning, but did not give further details. The arrest was the latest development in a confused and deadly series of encounters between police and the public that has highlighted the critical role of video in investigations. The protests started on Tuesday after Scottâ€™s death in the parking lot of his apartment complex on the east side of the city. Protesters have rallied to a cry of â€œrelease the tapesâ€ demanding that police release footage from that incident, and police have so far refused. They did show footage of the confrontation to the family, whose lawyer, Justin Bamberg, said has left the family with â€œmore questions than answersâ€. Information has proven mercurial throughout the protests. For instance, on Wednesday night after Carrâ€™s shooting, Putney said that he had died. Later city officials reversed that announcement and said that Carr was still alive. Then on Thursday the city confirmed that he had indeed died from his injuries. The city also said Carr was injured during a â€œcivilian on civilianâ€ shooting. But protesters were not inclined to take authorities at their word. â€œThere was no fight,â€ said Eddie Thomas, an attorney and Charlotte public defender. He was at the intersection in question to observe interactions between police and the public, he said. â€œThere was no issue between protesters. It just didnâ€™t happen. â€ Thomasâ€™s account matched with what other witnesses claimed to see. â€œI saw the police shoot that man almost point blank with my own eyes,â€ Jimmy James Tyson wrote on Facebook afterward. â€œPolice shot him close range in the side of the head with a rubber bullet. â€ The protests have been   and unpredictable. They began on Tuesday night near Scottâ€™s home, and by Wednesday had moved into the city center, the scene of violent confrontations between protesters and police. On Thursday night protesters moved to the John Belk Freeway, where they stopped cars until police fired tear gas canisters and pepper balls. Even so, it was more peaceful than Wednesday night. Charlotteâ€™s mayor, Jennifer Roberts, has declared a curfew to run daily from midnight to 6am. Police did not enforce the curfew Thursday night, allowing protesters to peacefully disperse. Local authorities have also called in state troopers and the National Guard for help controlling the crowds.

Thanks for following along with the liveblog. And well played Australia. Australia shot 50% in the game to the USAâ€™s 39%. The U. S. saved themselves from three, making 17 to Australiaâ€™s 7. Really, Carmelo alone from three saved the U. S.  If he hadnâ€™t been hot, Australia would have won the game.  A very good basketball game. Australia was in it the whole way. The USAâ€™s improved defense    and the scoring of Carmelo Anthony and Kyrie Irving (who combined for more than half of the U. S. points)    earned the victory. Australia entered the game as   underdogs. USA   Australia, 0:17 4th quarter, Irving hits two free throws after being fouled by former teammate Dellavedova. That should do it.  USA   Australia, 0:20 4th quarter, A wild Mills three from the corner is off the mark and the U. S. gets the ball. Australia is in a timeout. Theyâ€™ll need the U. S. to miss free throws to have a chance. USA   Australia, 0:27 4th quarter, Kyrie Irving only hits one free throw as Australia has begun to foul. No, the U. S. doesnâ€™t have DeAndre Jordan in the game. USA   Australia, 0:27 4th quarter, Australiaâ€™s inbounds play settled for a   jumper from Ingles. He missed.  That canâ€™t be what they drew up.   seconds left, Australiaâ€™s ball, trailing by five.  USA   Australia, 0:51 4th quarter, Carmelo and Kyrie Irving have scored all 23 points for the U. S. in the fourth quarter. That vaunted U. S. depth isnâ€™t really showing in this game, huh?  USA   Australia, 1:25 4th quarter, After Australia scores, Irving buries a clutch three from the quarter. We saw that back in June. Heâ€™s pretty good at those kind of shots. USA   Australia, 2:00 4th quarter, Australia is hanging in, but theyâ€™re past the point where they need to hang in. Two minutes left. Time to make a move. USA   Australia, 2:40 4th quarter, Dellavedova gets it to two scores with a floating runner along the baseline. USA   Australia, 3:32 4th quarter, Anthony. For three. Again.  He now has 31 points. USA   Australia, 3:58 4th quarter, Patty Mills hits    baskets to keep Australia in striking distance. Heâ€™s played a nearly flawless offensive game tonight.  USA   Australia, 4:36 4th quarter, And ANOTHER three by Anthony. He has eight on the night and the U. S. has its biggest lead. Odd that Australia isnâ€™t spending a timeout here. USA   Australia, 5:53 4th quarter, Re: the last post . .. maybe not. Dellavedova immediately answers to get it back to four. USA   Australia, 6:05 4th quarter, A Kyrie Irving jumper gives the U. S. its biggest lead since  . Is this finally the U. S. pulling away?  USA   Australia, 7:08 4th quarter, Two more threes from Carmelo in a big moment. Heâ€™s now got 25 points on the game. Again, Knicks fans have to wonder where this player is during the NBA season. From an   in San Antonio . ..  Hard not to root for Australia, both out of underdog fondness and loyalty to the San Antonio    Patty!! Besides. ..a cruise ship, guys??  Australia   USA, 9:00 4th quarter, David Andersen drills a three to tie the game and Ingles then gives Australia the lead in the lane. The U. S. is losing in the fourth quarter! Big improvement by the U. S. on defense in the third quarter giving up just 13 points. But theyâ€™re only up by three. Australia can win. To borrow a U. S. soccer chant: I believe that they can win.  USA   Australia, 0:30 3rd quarter, Big   play by Draymond Green driving down the lane and getting the foul. You donâ€™t see a lot of continuation fouls in international play, but the U. S. got one there. USA   Australia, 1:25 3rd quarter, Draymond Green just took a three that would have rattled in and counted in the NBA . .. but the Aussies knocked it off the rim (legal in international play) and then DeAndre Jordan got whistled for a foul while going after the ball. Good sequence for Australia.  USA   Australia, 3:44 3rd quarter, Durant hits two free throws to give the U. S. the lead. As this game rolls on, donâ€™t overlook how big it was that the Aussies stopped the bleeding after the U. S. opened the half  . Many other teams have folded when the U. S. gets rolling like that. Australia   USA, 5:10 3rd quarter, Australia comes right back and ties the game on a deep jumper from Dellavedova. And now Cousins picks up his fourth foul.  USA   Australia, 7:15 3rd quarter, Mills ends the run with a beautiful bucket down the lane. He has been the best player on the court so far tonight. He now has 17 points, tied with Carmelo for the gameâ€™s high. USA   Australia, 7:39 3rd quarter, The U. S. opens with a   run, leading to an Australia timeout. The last bucket of the run is a nice floater by Irving over Dellavedova. Maybe the Cavs made the right decision   at point guard. Australia   USA, 8:40 3rd quarter, The U. S. quickly ties it up on a bucket from Cousins and a three from Durant. Durant was    in the first half. The U. S. should just be glad he didnâ€™t apply for Australian citizenship during the break. Letâ€™s see if the U. S. rediscovered their talent in the locker room. I was knocking Australiaâ€™s bench, saying they couldnâ€™t compete with the USAâ€™s depth. And over the long run, they canâ€™t. But through the first half, Australiaâ€™s bench is outscoring the U. S. bench,  .  From   David Lobina . ..  What do we need to do so that commentators pronounce Dellavedovaâ€™s name correctly   i. e. as an Italian would? The stress should be on the VE of DellaVEdova, not on DO as most people seem to believe.  I donâ€™t know what we have to do. I just hope Iâ€™m saying â€œDellyâ€ right. If the U. S. loses, they should be evicted from their fancy yacht and forced to bunk with everyone else in the Athletesâ€™ Village. Dellavedova is playing great.  Wow.  Okay. Not quite that great. The Americans are trailing at halftime of an Olympics menâ€™s basketball game for the first time since 2004.  The U. S. only managed bronze in the 2004 Games. The U. S. gave up 29 points in the first quarter and then 25 more in the second. They have a lot to work on. More than can be fixed over a halftime. Team USAâ€™s depth will obviously be a big factor as the game drags on, but Australia has to like absolutely everything about this game so far. Australia   USA, 0:53 2nd quarter, Thereâ€™s Carmelo Anthonyâ€™s fifth(!) three of the half. If it wasnâ€™t for him, the U. S. would be getting destroyed.

Whether JosÃ© Mourinho wants an extended run in this competition is another matter  â€”   United have drawn West Ham at home in the next round  â€”   but at least he and his team have shifted some of the pressure on to his rival across town. Doubtless Pep Guardiola is not greatly enamoured of the lesser of the domestic trophies either, though he could have done with a victory here. This was Cityâ€™s sixth game in a row without a win, uncharted territory for their manager. The side he selected did not suggest an intention to win at all costs and, if he did not have an inkling before, the manager must now be fully aware that without David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne City tend to be short of snap and polish. â€œIt was nice to score but the most important thing was to put the last defeat behind us,â€ Mata said. â€œWe had a bad day in London [at Chelsea] and we knew we had to be strong and give 100% in this game. â€ Both sides made changes from their weekend lineups, though City made the most. Sergio AgÃ¼ero was named on the bench, John Stones left out and young prospects Aleix GarcÃ­a and Pablo Maffeo given rare starts, the latter making his   debut. Considering Marcos Rojo came in for the injured Eric Bailly the United team was closer to full strength, with Chris Smalling left out and Michael Carrick preferred to Marouane Fellaini. Mourinho apologised in the match programme for the performance at Chelsea and though he has previously said the EFL Cup has to be the lowest of his priorities, with this derby coming so quickly after the Stamford Bridge debacle he was aware of the need to field a side capable of obtaining a more acceptable result. United went behind in the first minute at Chelsea and survived a   scare here. JesÃºs Navas crossed from the right and found Kelechi Iheanacho in front of goal, but the striker could not adjust his body position in time and his   header flew over. The home sideâ€™s   midfield allowed Paul Pogba a freer role than has generally been the case this season and the France playerâ€™s mobility showed up well in the opening stages, though City moved the ball around better with their   game and GarcÃ­a was involved in several early attacks. For all that it was a fairly low wattage,   derby in the first half, short on quality and anything resembling goalmouth incident. Vincent Kompany seemed to sum up the paucity of proceedings when he hoofed the ball into touch like a rugby player when under no pressure in his own half, an odd sight quickly followed by the normally reliable Mata doing almost exactly the same thing. For most of the evening the City support, though outnumbered, had been making much more noise than their hosts, though a couple of interventions by Zlatan Ibrahimovic just before the interval finally brought the home crowd into voice. Poised to attempt the gameâ€™s first effort on target the Swede was foiled in the act of shooting by a timely block from NicolÃ¡s Otamendi, then when Ibrahimovic released Marcus Rashford down the left the teenager was only stopped by an even better tackle from Maffeo. Promising as those moments were for the home side, United could still have turned round behind. Five minutes from the break Iheanacho had a clear sight of goal on the left but held on to the ball too long in an attempt to improve his shooting angle and was dispossessed by Rojo coming across to cover from the opposite flank. Not entirely unexpectedly in front of the watching Belgium manager Kompany failed to appear for the second half, which began with Iheanacho wasting a good position by passing to an offside Nolito instead of spotting a better timed run from Leroy SanÃ©. Actual excitement finally arrived a couple of minutes later, with Ibrahimovic effortlessly giving Otamendi the slip to set up Pogba, who looked certain to score only for the faintest brush of Willy Caballeroâ€™s gloves to touch his shot on to a post. United were not to be denied, however, and took the lead on their next attack when the outstanding Ibrahimovic rolled a low cross into the City area towards Ander Herrera. Mike Dean could easily have awarded a penalty as the midfielder was unceremoniously bundled off the ball by Fernando and might have done so but for the ball running free for Mata to find Caballeroâ€™s bottom corner. United had upped their tempo noticeably since the interval and deserved to go in front, the City fans contented themselves with a plea for AgÃ¼ero to be sent on. They got Raheem Sterling instead. Making the most of Cityâ€™s disruption at the back United could have gone further in front when Rashford crossed from the left for Ibrahimovic uncharacteristically the striker failed to make any sort of contact. Guardiola did send AgÃ¼ero on after that, to little effect. There was nothing coming through from midfield and City failed to record an attempt on target all evening. United continued to press forward with more conviction and could have sealed it before the end but Rashford, having an   by his standards, put in a poor cross from another Ibrahimovic invitation with Pogba unmarked in the middle. â€œWe had to stay calm in the second half and we did,â€ said Herrera afterwards. â€œIt was a good performance and the fans can be proud again. â€",302,190,"859616897855311873	859892905577553924",fake
politifact15631,https://yournewswire.com/lisa-page-squeals-dnc-server-not-hacked-russia/,Lisa Page Squeals: DNC Server Was Not Hacked By Russia,"Missouri lawmakers pushed through several laws to expand gun rights in the state Wednesday night, overriding the veto of Governor Jay Nixon, who said the move would make citizens less safe.  The new legislation allows state residents to conceal a firearm without a permit. The law also establishes a â€œstand your groundâ€   standard, giving citizens the right to use deadly force in situations where they feel threatened. The move comes amid a sustained period of intense gun violence in St Louis, the stateâ€™s largest metropolitan area, which has one of the highest murder rates in the country.  Nixon vetoed the bill in July, after the mostly Republican state senators and representatives passed it. But lawmakers had passed the bill by such a wide margin, with the support of some Democrats, that they knew they could override the veto. After getting through the state senate on Wednesday night, the override moves on to the house where it is expected to succeed. Republican Brian Munzlinger, the state senator who sponsored   cited the San Bernardino and Orlandoâ€™s Pulse nightclub mass shootings as reasons why â€œwe should be doing all we can to make sure the citizens of Missouri have the ability to protect themselves. â€ Supporters of   refer to the law and others like it as â€œconstitutional carryâ€ on the premise that the second amendment grants citizens access to firearms without government permit. The National Rifle Association is supportive of the bill, as they have been of similar legislation in other states. Under previous state law, citizens had to complete a form and a   gun safety training program to qualify for concealed carry, and local law enforcement had the right to deny a permit to an applicant it found to be too risky. Now, as Nixon noted, â€œan individual who applies for a permit and is denied based on the sheriffâ€™s determination . .. would nevertheless be allowed . .. to carry a concealed weapon in Missouri the moment he leaves the sheriffâ€™s office. â€  Regardless of the new law, individuals in Missouri who are legally able to own a gun are not required to obtain any licensing or training to carry firearms openly. In the debate on the senate floor on Wednesday, Jason Holsman, a Democratic senator from Kansas City said: â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a burden to take an   course to understand the dos and the donâ€™ts, the shoulds and the shouldnâ€™ts, of carrying a loaded firearm. â€ Holsman tempered his opposition to the bill by touting his love of guns and support for the second amendment, adding: â€œThereâ€™s a lot of stuff in here I really like. â€  Democrats like Nixon and Holsman have been joined in their opposition of the law by gun control advocates and by numerous law enforcement agencies. Sam Dotson, the police chief of St Louis, warned that unrestricted open carry would make life more difficult and dangerous for police in an   in the St Louis Post Dispatch on Tuesday opposing the override. â€œPut partisan politics aside, put public safety first and let SB 656 remain where it belongs: in the graveyard of bad ideas,â€ Dotson wrote. St Louis is home to several of the countryâ€™s most violent neighborhoods in terms of firearm homicides. The cityâ€™s 2015 murder rate of 59 per 100, 000 residents was the highest among the largest 75 cities in the US. Dotsonâ€™s opposition to the Republican legislatureâ€™s bill is shared by both the stateâ€™s fraternal order of police and police chiefâ€™s association. In a letter to the governor, FOP president Kevin Ahlbrand said the bill â€œwill cost not only citizen lives but will also be extremely dangerous to law enforcement officersâ€. With this move the Missouri legislature follows in the footsteps of West Virginia. In March, that stateâ€™s legislature also overrode a gubernatorial veto to enact unrestricted concealed carry legislation. Also rallying in opposition to the override are advocates against domestic violence who fear that lax access to guns will leave abused individuals more prone to fatal violence. The conceal carry process was the only piece of law â€œthat had any provisions to protect domestic violence victims from precluding their abusers from having weapons was the conceal carry permit processâ€ said Colleen Coble, CEO of the Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. â€œNow there is no mechanism for law enforcement to take action about known offenders who have been violent to their families. â€ The legislatureâ€™s override also makes Missouri the 30th state to adopt some version of the    statute that absolves citizens of the duty to retreat from dangerous situations. Stand your ground came into national focus after the 2012 killing of    Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. Although Martinâ€™s killer George Zimmerman, who was ultimately acquitted of charges in the death, did not specifically invoke the statute in his defense, the concept was included as part of the juryâ€™s instructions on  .

politifact14205,worldnewsdailyreport.com/bin-laden-is-alive-and-well-in-the-bahamas-says-edward-snowden/,"Bin Laden is “Alive and well in the Bahamas”, says Edward Snowden","Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood has become a father again, to twin girls, two days before his 69th birthday. He and his wife, Sally Humphreys, 38, welcomed their daughters on Monday.  A statement said the couple were â€œdelighted to announce the birth of their twins Gracie Jane (6lb)  Alice Rose (5. 7lb). The girls arrived on 30 May at 10. 30pm and all are doing brilliantly. The babies are perfect. â€ The twins are Woodâ€™s fifth and sixth children, but his first with Humphreys, who is a theatre producer.  His other children are Jesse Wood, with his first wife, former model Krissy Wood daughter Leah and son Tyrone from his second marriage to Jo and Jamie, Joâ€™s son from a previous marriage, who Wood adopted.  The musician and Humphreys dated for six months before they married at the Dorchester hotel in London, with Rod Stewart as Woodâ€™s best man, in 2012.  In an interview with Hello! magazine, Humpreys said they did not notice the more than   age gap, but Wood did say his wife is sometimes mistaken for his daughter.  She said: â€œMaybe itâ€™s the     thing, but we donâ€™t notice it. â€  The couple met while Humphreys was working at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, where Wood was displaying some of his artwork.

politifact15205,http://www.newsdonaldtrumps.com/robert-redford-says-michelle-and-barack-obama-should-get-five-years-in-prison/,Robert Redford Says: Michelle And Barack Obama Should Get Five Years In Prison,"In the idyllic and also more than slightly insane seaside town of East Hampton, New York, just a mile away from waves crashing on to sandy shores and a rustic windmill that has turned in ocean air since 1806, austere arrangements of lines and grids serve an atmosphere of a markedly different kind. Tubes of bright fluorescent light shine in alternately inviting and estranging tones, with strategic deviations between extremes at different ends of a spectrum. Exacting patterns play out in measured stacks of metal boxes placed    on a wall. Momentous paintings that only barely register as paintings at all command attention with nothing more in terms of subject matter than the subtlest distinctions between shades of white and grey.  The occasion for the congregation of them all is Aspects of Minimalism, an exhibition of minimalist art. Much of it hails from the heyday of the minimalism in the 1960s and 70s, when the term was affixed to strains of painting and sculpture that could be seen as a reaction, a reduction or a reification in line with an idea that art is in the ideal state when  â€”   no more, no less  â€”   it is what it is.  The setting for the exhibition is Guild Hall, a small and charming museum where work of the kind looks both at home and alien in this world. Getting there from New York City takes about three hours on a train or a bus, through suburban terrain that transforms into a sort of pastoral paradise. East Hampton, of all the Hamptons that serve as exurban sanctuaries and resorts, is the most moneyed and manicured, beautiful but with an anxiety and tension to it too. Sit and eat lunch on a bench in the serene town center and observe a pompous man exit his Porsche with a vanity license plate reading BOTML1NE. Stroll the shops and spy a bathing suit   with an image of midtown Manhattan, perfect for the beachgoer eager to miss the point of going to the beach entirely. Drop into Harperâ€™s Books, a   destination devoted to rare and collectible art books, and lay eyes on an edition of a Donald Judd catalogue raisonnÃ© that can be yours but only for $8, 500. Money is hard to forget or avoid in East Hampton, but there is enough of it to want to privilege signs of good taste and discretion too. The simple beauty of the place is astonishing, in a way that fuses farmland with the sea. Swaying sawgrass, quietly imperial trees, white sand that leads out to the oceanâ€™s deep blue  â€”   itâ€™s a countryside Eden in many ways.  Inside Guild Hall, the environs are more reserved. For Aspects of Minimalism, visitors are greeted by wall text that aligns the exhibition with artists who â€œsought to remove any sign of personal expressivity, allowing the viewer to experience the work more intensely without the distractions of overt symbolism, narrative, and emotional contentâ€. Many of these artists, the text continues, were reacting squarely against the â€œgestural excessesâ€ of abstract expressionism, â€œchallenging the conventional boundaries between various mediums, subordinating authorship, and calling attention to the materiality of their worksâ€.  Materials vary, from felt (Joseph Beuys) and corten steel (Donald Judd) to gunpowder (Ed Ruscha) and graphite (Agnes Martin). But the materials matter less than the ways they are arranged, in most cases very particularly. A somewhat loose curatorial conceit makes for the inclusion of work that classes as minimalism in less than strict and definitive ways (Gerhard Richter, Ruscha, Bridget Riley and Andy Warhol) but the classics, as it were, appear at home in their shared company.  Judd features with four works, including a pair of horizontally splayed wall pieces suggestive of mathematical properties internal to the sculptures themselves and a vertical array of six rectangular boxes  â€”   Untitled (Hernandez 94. 2) from 1994  â€”   that seems to evince a sort of ecosystem with its mix of rusty orange weathered steel and green plexiglass. Elsewhere another untitled Judd box, on its own alone, plays games with empty space as defined by mercurial differences between black and navy blue.  Among other work about measurement and more formal constraints, two large paintings by Martin breathe deep and subtly swallow up the air around them. The Peach, from 1964, tends toward a weighty grey with oil paint anointed by hazy silver pencil lines, while a later and much whiter work (Untitled #5, from 1989) seems to just hover in front of a viewer whose gaze goes nowhere and everywhere at once. The most material aspect of it is a shiny silver frame, echoed nicely by the placement nearby of a sculpture by Larry Bell comprising clear glass and similarly silver metal binding  â€”   just space, really, surrounded on all sides by windows to peer in.   All the art in the show, on view through 10 October, is from collections based on Long Island, all but one of the works belonging to Leonard Riggio, the founder and executive chairman of the Barnes  Noble bookstore chain. Having recently announced his impending retirement  â€”   and with art activities including years of significant patronage for the Dia Art Foundation  â€”   Riggio gave a lecture at Guild Hall on opening weekend, to about 50   there on a sunny summer Saturday.   â€œWe were not looking at art as an asset class as is now all the rage,â€ Riggio said of his formidable collection. Minimalism, in a wide and ranging sense suggested by the exhibition, is among his favored modes, he said, for the ways it is â€œas elusive as it is profoundâ€. He professed to know a little about art  â€”   but, amiably, â€œnot enough to make a fool of myselfâ€.  Considering minimalist icons in the context of a collection  â€”   as pieces to ostensibly be lived with in settings different than the museums and galleries in which they are most often seen  â€”   teases out elements of the work at odds with customary ways of regarding minimalism as totemic, remote and cold. As an aside in the Guild Hall show, a brief documentary by Chris Felver presents a portrait of the stalwart Judd at home in Marfa, Texas, the dusty desert town where he fashioned many of his gleaming pieces  â€”   less an alien aesthete and a looming legend than a guy in a plaid shirt with a lot of sun on his face.  The look of the art in Guild Hall guides it toward that kind of   lineage, at least in part. Curved molding along the ceilings and soft carpet on the floors  â€”   something, anything different than the standard   setting  â€”   can serve as a reminder of all the foraging and forging that went into making minimalism what it was at the start. Reading up on some history on the train, in the new book Eye of the Sixties: Richard Bellamy and the Transformation of Modern Art by Judith E Stein, the distance between artâ€™s creation by a bunch of bohemian scroungers and the ways it is most often encountered in antiseptic surroundings could not have been more clear.   Bellamy was a prescient curator who identified many of the minimalists early, when their work was still negotiating its way out of a blessed mess. About Flavin, whose sculptures in fluorescent light prove prominent via four pieces in the Guild Hall show, Stein writes of a young artist who â€œscavenged the city for detritus that appealed to his eyeâ€. The image continues: â€œIn his unheated apartment in the Meatpacking District he arranged his street finds with the care previous centuries lavished on their curiosity cabinets. â€ Light bulbs were industrial materials before they were grist for artworks of ethereal power and grace. They were worldly more than is typically remembered in the historical record.   Another recent show, Carl Andre in His Time, at the Mnuchin gallery in New York, put similar work in a similarly unusual setting last year. It was a   gallery with a richly moneyed atmosphere, but a townhouse with ornamental detail work and dark wood on the Upper East Side is a long way from all the stark cement and   uniformity elsewhere. In that show, minimalism by some of the same artists (plus Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold and Robert Ryman, among others) proved approachable and more receptive to a kind of curiosity that can linger. Works burrowed into corners and stuck out in spaces where a person could actually, conceivably live. A stack of boxes by Judd greeted   at the top of a grand and winding staircase  â€”   an atypical tableau indeed.  Another home for minimalistic experiences of the sort is, like Guild Hall, also out in the Hamptons, at the eminently rewarding Dan Flavin Art Institute in Bridgehampton, New York. In an unassuming building since 1983, when it opened to the public with support from the Dia Art Foundation after being arranged by the artist himself, the permanently installed display of Flavinâ€™s work with fluorescent light takes up a setting that was, more than a century ago, a   firehouse and later a Baptist church. A white picket fence runs along the outside, and the floors creak once inside through a weighty wooden door.   Upstairs is an assembly of light sculptures built into tiny hallways and alcoves that work in isolation and also interconnect. A single vertical red bulb greets you in the main space, glowing intensely in the center and softening as illumination from the tube disperses. The other pieces  â€”   with bulbs in pink, blue, yellow and green  â€”   grow more elaborate and complexly composed.   The colors seem to change as you make your way from piece to piece, or certainly to modulate in relation to one another. One that is deep green appears to be white after having looked at what follows, a trick of the eye or perception or perhaps not a trick at all. Blues and pinks seem to fluctuate in terms of intensity while staying static all the while. Slight openings through the ends of certain walls look different from one direction than the other, in a manner that makes less sense the more you try to figure it out. Wonder is more appropriate, or at least an openness to the kind of experience that can benefit from a lack of mediation.  Here is a refuge, all too rare and fertile whenever found, for minimalism to come home to a state where the worldly and otherworldly meet.",839,785,"889220149416472577	889242494025728003	889329408678539264	889417674010357760	889476806511906816	889561159879319552	902304926629494786	902489842822647808	902533485432377344	902604951691509760	905210703547699201",fake
politifact15138,https://web.archive.org/web/20180210020716/http://www.delta-flying.info:80/?,Delta Ticket 2017,"To the long list of things that Donald Trumpâ€™s election has upended, we should add one more: the way Jews see the world. For most of the last century, Jews have regarded America as a safe haven. While Europe had inflicted on its Jewish population a history of expulsion, persecution and eventually industrialised slaughter, the United States had given them a place where they could survive, and thrive. The words on the base of the Statue of Liberty welcomed refugees like them: â€œGive me your huddled masses, yearning to breathe freeâ€  â€”   words, incidentally, written by Emma Lazarus, herself a Jew. Not for nothing, did Jews refer to the US as the goldene medina, a golden land, a place of comfort after centuries of suffering. In recent years, that sense had only sharpened. Reports of rising antisemitism, as well as a surge in xenophobic nationalism, in Europe confirmed for many Americans their sense that the old world was still haunted by its old,   demons. For many US Jews, Europe seemed permanently stuck in 1938, on the brink of an antisemitic catastrophe. In this conception, the US remained comfortably immune from the virus of  . That certainty has vanished in the last week  â€”   and the appointment of Steve Bannon as the most senior adviser to the incoming president has deepened the anxiety. For Bannon is the boss of the   Breitbart website, which as well as attacking women, Muslims and   has targeted Jews. A recent column denounced the journalist Anne Applebaum: â€œHell hath no fury like a Polish, Jewish, American elitist scorned. â€ Another slammed the Republican editor of the Weekly Standard as a â€œrenegade Jewâ€. Of course, one should always be wary of the accusations divorcing spouses make against each other, but Bannonâ€™s   testified that he once objected to her choice of school for their daughters because â€œhe didnâ€™t want the girls going to school with Jewsâ€. (Bannon denies this happened, pointing to the fact that his wife prevailed in her choice of school.) If it were just Bannonâ€™s   that was at issue, perhaps the concern could be contained. But the problem is that Trumpâ€™s campaign trafficked in the full range of antisemitic motifs and tropes. Itâ€™s not just that Trump himself retweeted   or that his campaign put out an image of Hillary that had been lifted from an antisemitic site  â€”   depicting Hillary Clinton against a giant backdrop of cash and a   star uncannily like a Star of David. Itâ€™s that last month Trump warned that Clinton â€œmeets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereigntyâ€  â€”   a line that could have been lifted straight from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the notorious   forgery that purported to be evidence of a global Jewish conspiracy. Trump pushed the same   canard in his closing TV ad. It featured a gallery of three villains, all of whom were Jews: philanthropist George Soros, the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, and the Goldman Sachs boss, Lloyd Blankfein. The narratorâ€™s words used as each of those faces appeared came from the  lexicon of classic antisemitism. Soros: â€œthose who control the levers of powerâ€. Yellen: â€œglobal special interestsâ€. Blankfein: â€œglobal power structureâ€. Trump supporters have taken their cue and bombarded Jewish journalists with the vilest form of abuse. None of this has ended with the campaign. The conspiracy theorist and propagandist Alex Jones says Trump has phoned him since his election, promising to appear on his radio show â€œin the next few weeksâ€. Last month Jones ranted against â€œthe Jewish mafia in the United Statesâ€. Itâ€™s worth stressing two things. This is not antisemitism of the subtle variety. Nor is this antisemitism of the kind that we have got used to debating in Britain in recent years: an obsessive hostility to Israel that draws on the language or imagery of   racism. This is   hardcore,       antisemitism. And it is being voiced not by European leftists or Muslims  â€”   who, until last week, many American Jews held to be the chief source of modern antisemitism  â€”   but by Americaâ€™s next president and his allies. Of course some have tried to reassure themselves that thereâ€™s nothing to worry about. They point to the fact that Trump is close to his Jewish    Jared Kushner, and that indeed Ivanka Trump has converted to Judaism. This is to ignore the fact that antisemites have often exempted those they deem to be â€œgood Jewsâ€ exceptions to an otherwise robust rule. They forget that antisemites frequently boast that â€œSome of my best friends are Jewishâ€ that those denouncing Jews will often place a friendly hand on the arm of the Jew in the room and say, â€œI donâ€™t mean you, of course. â€ Others have sought comfort in the fact that Trump has made some positive noises towards Israel, and that Binyamin Netanyahu has given him a friendly welcome. But this is to forget what European Jews learned long ago: that nasty rightwing nationalists can be    â€”   for reasons utterly alien to Jewsâ€™ own feelings about the country. So   might admire Israel either because they see it as standing up to those they deem the Muslim enemy or because they like the idea of a country far away that might take the Jews off their hands. Neither of these sentiments makes them  . This distinction has set European Jewish communities at odds with Israeli governments repeatedly over the years. Itâ€™s happening again now in Austria, as the local Jewish community fears the   presidential candidate Norbert Hofer even as Israeli officials have engaged with him. Small European communities have been saying for years now that   is not the same as  . But they were too small to be listened to. Now that same argument is playing out on a much bigger stage, as Americaâ€™s   League bravely denounces the   while others say Trump should be given a chance.

The billionaire founder of the Virgin empire  â€”   who does not have the right to vote in the UK  â€”   is launching the campaign on Monday. He lives in the British Virgin Islands but pointed out that the Virgin businesses, which span financial services and gyms, employ 50, 000 people in the UK. Branson said: â€œAs an entrepreneur I have been known for taking risks throughout my career, but leaving the European Union is not one of the risks I would want the UK to take  â€”   not as an investor, not as a father and not as a grandfather. I am deeply concerned about the impact of leaving. â€ He has registered his campaign with the Electoral Commission, which suggests he intends to spend more than Â£10, 000 on his efforts to win support for the remain side.  â€œAlthough Iâ€™ve been living in the British Virgin Islands for some time now, I have never stopped caring passionately about the UK and its great people,â€ Branson said. He also pointed to other benefits of the EU, saying: â€œMy father Ted fought in North Africa, Italy and Germany during world war two. My grandfather survived the horrors of the trenches in world war one. I truly believe that one of the EUâ€™s greatest achievements is that it has kept its members out of conflict in Europe. â€ The business community is not unanimous on remaining in the EU, however, with 37   business leaders writing in the Sun on Sunday to say the country can survive outside the â€œ â€ European project. A Virgin spokesperson said: â€œRichard has lived overseas for some years and so heâ€™s not on the electoral register. Richardâ€™s children and grandchildren live in the UK and clearly as an investor Richard has interests in the UK, with Virgin businesses employing over 50, 000 people. Richard is urging every single one of them to vote in. â€",547,251,"907052331501592576	907052398891466752	907085101242216449	907337255878103046",fake

Kensington Palace sources said that the prince feared for the safety of Meghan Markle and her family after they were â€œsubjected to a wave of abuseâ€ during newspaper investigations into what, until Tuesday, had been an unconfirmed relationship. An unprecedented statement, authorised by Harry, also complained of â€œa smear on the front pageâ€ of one newspaper about Markle and that her lawyers were engaged in â€œnightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papersâ€. Palace sources added that police had to be called last week after a photographer allegedly barged into the actorâ€™s garage in Toronto. The front page â€œsmearâ€ complained of in Harryâ€™s statement referred to the Sunâ€™s piece about clips of Markle in network television drama Suits appearing on Pornhub, an adult website. It was headlined â€œHarry girlâ€™s on Pornhubâ€ even though what was posted were clips of intimate scenes from the programme, and not pornography. The Sun strongly denied any smear and said it made clear that the â€œsteamy sex scenesâ€ it had referred to appearing on the adult site were from her appearances in the US drama series. However sources told the Guardian that reporters from the Sun were pulled back from trying to conduct â€œdoorstepâ€ interviews on Friday amid concerns about the behaviour of the US media, and that the Pornhub story was removed from the Sunâ€™s website on Friday after some critical comments.  But what has particularly shocked Harry is the â€œdangerous relationshipâ€ in which newspaper reports and comment pieces that he considers racist and sexist sparked a torrent of vitriol against Markle on Twitter and other social media platforms as well as in comment sections below online news stories. Markleâ€™s father, Thomas, is white and her mother, Doria Ragland,   and she has written about her heritage on her website, describing herself as biracial and â€œhalf black and half whiteâ€ which has been referenced in many articles about their new relationship. The Palace is understood to have been particularly unhappy with one comment piece in last weekendâ€™s Mail on Sunday, by Rachel Johnson, which said that if the couple had children, â€œthe Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNAâ€. â€œSome of this has been very public,â€ the palaceâ€™s statement said. â€œThe smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. â€ The palace also complained of the â€œbombardment of nearly every friend,   and loved one in her lifeâ€ and the harassment of her mother at her home in Los Angeles, who has had to â€œstruggle past photographers in order to get to her front doorâ€. â€œGiven what she was going through in the press and what was happening privately, Harry no longer felt it was acceptable for someone in his position to sit quietly,â€ a palace source said. â€œThis is happening because of him, not her. The traditional   position no longer felt acceptable to him. â€œOnce it was clear last week and through the weekend that this was accelerating and wasnâ€™t washing through, then it was increasingly unacceptable in his mind to not add his voice. He is not naive. These stories will continue. He just wants people who are reading these stories in the future to at least have his point of view in the back of their minds and to at least have heard from him about what he thinks about them. â€ Among the other articles that concerned the palace because of their racial connotations was about a piece on DailyMail. com headlined â€œHarryâ€™s girl is (almost) straight outta Comptonâ€ in a reference to the rap record by NWA. The prince is also concerned that now that he is 32, the press will consider that any girl he has a relationship with â€œmay be â€˜the oneâ€™ and so they will get treated as fair gameâ€. â€œThat is a very difficult place for any woman to be in, and being in a position where he is not able to protect her is a very serious concern for him,â€ the source added. The Sun said it was taken aback by Harryâ€™s statement and said his reference to legal battles, bribes or racial undertones was not a reference to the Rupert   tabloid. On Saturday, the Sun told readers that Markleâ€™s background had more in common with the modern British family than those in the â€œfusty royal corridorsâ€ and was more relevant to the modern woman than the Duchess of Cambridge. â€œMeghan, with her divorce, her ethnic background and       work ethic is much more the   womanâ€ something â€œthe future of the royal family may depend onâ€. A source at the paper said Harryâ€™s communications team failed to offer any guidance when reports emerged of their relationship first emerged in the Sunday Express last month. â€œThey had three days to stop this story,â€ they said. â€œAny decent press office would have put out a statement saying they were in a relationship, saying they have a right to privacy, etc, and that would have been that. But they didnâ€™t. â€ A source at the Daily Mail said they were bewildered by Harryâ€™s reference to harassment, bribes and crossing a line. They said they did not know what his communications staff were referring to. Katie Nicholl, royal correspondent for the Mail on Sunday, told LBC radio: â€œIf he really wants this to go away, there is one or two things he could do. You give the press what they want. You make a statement, or you give an interview or you issue a picture. There has not been one picture of them together. Fleet Street will not rest until they have got their picture of them together and they have got some words either from Prince Harry or Meghan about the relationship. â€",58,907,"1018525236420104194	1018525944817094656	1018530164576260098	1018536603789221890	1018546272742109184	1018564465745453056	1018636033188130818	1018651617825120257	1018666755689009153	1018671724576067584	1018673233539854336	1018675964551843842	1018679846921175040	1018683168046698497	1018685398581694464	1018687267525799936	1018691847265320962	1018700397844680704	1018706536204562433	1018706602919161856	1018711917391564801	1018712806089220096	1018716873993740288	1018721250930147328	1018721680187850753	1018723858248028160	1018732677715746816	1018801707567013888	1018827730400481280	1018838321655623680	1018845016310145024	1018845996460232705	1018850462450290688	1018851495503106048	1018854442005909504	1018855528477360128	1018857495392079873	1018857598177763330	1018857715031052289	1018859747519467521	1018862475725373441	1018864703337123840	1018868699929989120	1018874426958348288	1018883449866870784	1018888758291324928	1018888832429805568	1018888969348636672	1018889448807731200	1018889726776967168	1018890054394146816	1018890842554191873	1018890900691410945	1018895668079886337	1018896134935334917	1018897591310995456	1018901572745682945	1018902060761255936	1018902669618905088	1018903644085686272	1018905016055156736	1018905361925877760	1018909256941268992	1018924358243364864	1018926056198299648	1018928101038919685	1018934856955424768	1018938023059316737	1018943527105986561	1018944913185083392	1018954453825785856	1018961636147724288	1018963044355985408	1018967460404432896	1018979130266783744	1018984292045729792	1018989434669338625	1018989551384256512	1018991196239204352	1018994751658479620	1019005571658379269	1019006873809416192	1019008117831499776	1019015175679160321	1019017408919560192	1019029485306474502	1019029763141365762	1019031320029224961	1019052697306181632	1019060715204829185	1019084532824276992	1019092631324954624	1019095205587423233	1019103586284781569	1019107432386220033	1019107617602506752	1019111513867603968	1019130165153140736	1019139321868226561	1019148661748649989	1019157610950545409	1019157944011821056	1019163222698545152	1019167835065548806	1019169972776468481	1019179893265924096	1019181521255612417	1019188028378513408	1019191830360068096	1019206209415602176	1019226320860012544	1019231562423029766	1019237438676348929	1019265528131710977	1019295152605728770	1019295162722222080	1019304259144171520	1019306591382851585	1019339583341948928	1019352089384779776	1019352355450621952	1019354660614885376	1019373860788023297	1019374375848628229	1019376188324765698	1019387113043824640	1019396670428246017	1019397118245703681	1019406038079074305	1019425380296478721	1019433070372454400	1019451835365691392	1019531129341251585	1019550891240718337	1019552289760137216	1019567243871518721	1019578481926078464	1019608391352713217	1019629054620622848	1019633355543990273	1019635219765198848	1019636650471776256	1019651195605004290	1019701027640135681	1019706026701017093	1019726111599718400	1019742305752944640	1019743793862660096	1019762776745693185	1019781546839101440	1019784590423134208	1019799004518010880	1019803947094233089	1019883406468026368	1019902271059038208	1019915745411653638	1019921659489341440	1019951926597824513	1019975545843601408	1019977951411146752	1019986832795275266	1020002349211717632	1020004563645059073	1020023487606317056	1020027119722729472	1020042783078445056	1020099416349380609	1020144311957164034	1020147992416878592	1020357266183213056	1020392269537587200	1020511238625914880	1020678895538921475	1021492727291293697	1021810972711940102	1022309649310089217	1027788378971025408	1028451528150077440	1040259003459219457	1054538282858622977",fake

The high school that wonâ€™t allow girls to wear shirts that reveal their shoulders. The judge who berates a lawyer for wearing a pantsuit rather than a skirt. From the time we are girls and throughout our lives, women are told what to wear and how to look in order to project the â€œrightâ€ image. Weâ€™re supposed to look â€œfeminineâ€ but not so sexy as to not be taken seriously. We need to look authoritative, but not intimidating. For women, negotiating what weâ€™re supposed to look like can be downright exhausting, especially when the standard of whatâ€™s deemed appropriate can change drastically from place to place. Those who havenâ€™t engaged in this particular balancing act may think itâ€™s much ado about nothing  â€”   just look professional and leave it at that! But research bears out what women have long known: how traditionally â€œfeminineâ€ we appear significantly impacts the way people judge us. Earlier this year, for example, a study out of the University of Colorado at Boulder found that female scientists who looked more feminine were frequently assumed not to be scientists. Researchers asked participants to look at photos of male and female scientists, rate them on a scale from masculine to feminine, and guess whether they were a scientist or a teacher. Women thought to be more   were more likely to be identified as teachers. Menâ€™s perceived masculinity or femininity, however, had no impact on whether or not people thought they were scientists. â€œWe knew there were accounts out there in the literature for decades that women scientists canâ€™t wear skirts if they want to be taken seriously. They are seen as â€˜too feminine,â€™â€ researcher and lead author Sarah Banchefsky has said. Some women in Stem fields, she says, feel like they canâ€™t even talk about wanting to have children. It seems that the more supposedly womanly you seem the less seriously you are taken. Itâ€™s a real problem in an area like the sciences, where women are already underrepresented. But itâ€™s certainly not limited to the Stem fields. Women in other areas, like academia, face the same dilemma. As professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou wrote here in the Guardian in 2014, â€œa woman who adopts a more feminine style is too preoccupied with pretty things to be a serious academic, because a woman canâ€™t be both attractive and intelligent. â€ (Of course if a woman adopts a look that comes across as too masculine, sheâ€™s dismissed or berated for that, as well.) Part of the problem may be the general disdain we have for all things thought of as girly. The more feminine something is, the less seriously we take it. Even among feminists, there is a line of thinking that eschews trappings thought of as traditionally female  â€”   we donâ€™t want our daughters participating in princess culture, or we roll our eyes when they want yet another pink frilly dress. Iâ€™m guilty of this myself. As Julia Serano wrote in her groundbreaking book, Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity, â€œuntil feminists work to empower femininity and pry it away from the insipid, inferior meanings that plague it  â€”   weakness, helplessness, fragility, passivity, frivolity, and artificiality  â€”   those meanings will continue to haunt every person who is female   feminineâ€. When we send the message  â€”   to our kids, friends or    â€”   that the traditionally feminine is somehow less than, we give power to the most foundational sexist ideas about what kinds of gender expression should be taken seriously.

He was 89. His life represented just how far bluegrass had traveled, from its formidable days in the 1940s of the mountain region of the upland south to today, where core elements of the music are heard everywhere. Throughout his seven decades as a working musician, Stanley survived downturns in the industry not once, but many times, each time returning stronger and primed to introduce the music to new ears. As the eternal leader of the Clinch Mountain Boys  â€”   a revolving group that in different incarnations included Keith Whitley and Ricky Skaggs  â€”   he trained two generations of musicians to carry the music forward. His tenor voice is remembered as the last of its kind  â€”   unvarnished, solitary, searching. â€œI call him â€˜the king of mountain soulâ€™ there was something so moving about his voice. It was ancient and  . At the same time during a show he could veer off into something that was very joyful and uplifting and fun,â€ says Jim Lauderdale, who recorded and produced Stanley, sharing a Grammy with him in 2002 for Lost in the Lonesome Pines, a collaborative album. â€œHe just had that indefinable quality about him that just really made people feel and allowed them to go through that wide range of emotions. As a listener that is pretty rare in the history of music. Only the greats have that quality,â€ he says. Stanley was born 25 February 1927 in Dickenson County, Virginia. Tucked in the   region of the state, the area was dominated by coal mines and deep forests. His mother, who played banjo, taught him the traditional clawhammer style of playing, which requires the player to strike their fingers downward in rhythm.  â€œI learned the finger   roll, but I didnâ€™t want to sound like anybody. I wanted it to be my style,â€ he told this writer in 2014. He and Carter Stanley, his brother, formed the Stanley Brothers in 1946 and accelerated the style of bluegrass already developed by Bill Monroe  â€”   breakneck rhythms, impeccably timed arrangements, close harmonies in high registers, and almost   improvisational breaks. The term â€œbluegrassâ€ hadnâ€™t even been invented by the time they secured their first record contract, with Columbia Records in 1948. The Stanley Brothers introduced   harmony singing, aided by mandolin player Darrell â€œPee Weeâ€ Lambert, who remains the only surviving member of the group.  The sound brought a haunting quality to the music that would define the genre. Songs like The White Dove, The Lonesome River, The Wandering Boy, and Death is Only a Dream were example of songs that used simple images, but elicited deep emotions through the interlocking harmonies. The group also popularized traditional folk songs like Pretty Polly, Little Maggie, and Iâ€™m a Man of Constant Sorrow, introducing them to a younger generation of folk singers in the late 1950s and 1960s like Bob Dylan. During this period the Stanley Brothers are also credited for being the first bluegrass group to give prominence to the lead guitar. Over their first two decades, the Stanleys recorded for Columbia, Mercury and even King Records, an early home to James Brown. In fact, it is Brownâ€™s   that are heard on the Stanley Brothers song Finger Poppinâ€™ Time in 1960. By then, rockâ€˜nâ€™roll had done damage to the bluegrass market. Musicians like Monroe, Flatt  Scruggs, and the Stanley Brothers had discovered a new audience on the college circuit where they found eager fans at the Newport folk festival and University of Chicago folk festival, among others. Carter Stanley died unexpectedly of liver disease in 1966 at age 41, leaving his brother at a crossroads. Carter was the bandleader and dominant presence in the band. He was also the primary lyricist. By contrast, Ralph was shy and  . â€œMy brother did most of the emcee work and publicity and all of the talking,â€ Stanley said in 2014. â€œI had to get used to that. Iâ€™ve done my best. â€ Under Ralphâ€™s direction, the Clinch Mountain Boys emphasized sacred music and songs from his early Appalachian roots. He also brought in younger players to mentor. In a statement, Skaggs called Stanley his â€œheroâ€ and â€œa kind and humble king from the mountainsâ€. â€œI was blessed to know him, love him and make music with him as a young teenager,â€ he said. â€œHe carried the ancient sounds from God knows where. Ralph found it in the music of the mountains, in the hollows, in the people and in the churches. â€ By the 1990s, bluegrass would once again fall dormant, but its revival was sparked from an unlikely source: The 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? by the Coen Brothers, with a soundtrack that featured Stanley in a prominent role. A revival was soon underway and the Down from the Mountain tour, featuring musicians from the film and others, played to packed theaters. At age 73, Stanley was suddenly bigger than ever. He earned his first Grammy, and the soundtrack album topped the Billboard 200 chart, selling millions of copies. He would later say he watched the film six times. â€œI liked that movie and it helped me a lot getting better known to new fans,â€ he said. Stanley closed every night of the tour with O Death, a traditional ballad that served as a conversation with God, asking for more time on earth to do good. â€œOh Death please consider my   donâ€™t take me at this stage,â€ he sang. â€œWonâ€™t you spare me over â€™til another year?â€ Stanley had 16 more years where he played about 100 dates a year and collaborated with a long list of admirers, some within his field like Del McCoury and grandson Nathan Stanley, and many not, like Elvis Costello and Robert Plant. Many others, including Bob Dylan, George Jones, Vince Gill, Randy Owen, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, Dolly Parton, Ricky Skaggs, Joan Baez, Pam Tillis and Porter Wagoner, sought him out for duets. Shy from an early age, the attention was something he had to learn how to handle  â€”   which he did. After performances, it was common for him to appear in the lobby afterwards to meet fans and sign autographs. He also became a regular face at the White House, where he performed for a succession of US presidents. â€œHe slowly became comfortable in that position to where he could be a master showman,â€ Lauderdale said.  Yet all this time, Stanley never moved to Nashville or anywhere else. He lived in Sandy Ridge, Virginia, only a few miles from his childhood farm. Even there, he invited fans to come to him through a traditional mountain music center he operated and an annual festival. â€œI had planned to retire after this year, but I feel good, about as good as

politifact14837,mightynest.com/learn/research-by-concern/dangers-of-triclosan, If You Are Using This Toothpaste… Throw It Away Immediately Nov 28,"â€œLacey had a theory that people have a finite capacity for the enjoyment of their favorite things. Songs, movies, books, food: Weâ€™re hardwired for specific quantities of pleasure, and once the amount is exceeded, good goes bad,â€ teenage Hannah Dexter explains in Robin Wassermanâ€™s new novel Girls on Fire. â€œVery rarely, Lacey said, you find something for which your brain has infinite capacity, and that, Lacey said, is the thing we call love. â€ Lacey Champlain is the new girl in Battle Creek, the rural Pennsylvania town where Hannah has spent her entire life. The high school they both attend is still in shock following their popular classmate Craig Ellisonâ€™s apparent suicide. Lacey becomes more than just Hannahâ€™s best and only friend: Sheâ€™s her guru, preaching ideas that Hannah sometimes misunderstands but always absorbs. Now that theyâ€™ve found each other, the thing Lacey calls love isnâ€™t just an abstract concept for the girls. It also seems to describe her connection to Hannah.  Stop me if this is beginning to sound familiar. Itâ€™s fair to say, now that it is inspiring articles and thinkpieces, that the â€œgirlâ€ book has become a genre of its own. Inspired by Gillian Flynnâ€™s 2012 blockbuster Gone Girl, a whole host of novels have set themselves up as explorations of or elaborations on certain feminine stereotypes. These novels take the shape of thrillers, but their animating mission is to question. In Flynnâ€™s novel, the trope to be questioned was the Cool Girl. Gone Girlâ€™s twisted narrator Amy defined a Cool Girl as â€œa hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like sheâ€™s hosting the worldâ€™s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2. â€ The Cool Girl exists to fulfill menâ€™s fantasies, and Amy sees herself as this womanâ€™s antithesis: one particular manâ€™s worst nightmare.  The trope  â€”   and this passage in the Flynn novel  â€”   has proved enduring, more so than is typical for a commercial bestseller. The Cool Girl seems   for an era when womenâ€™s media and social media hashtag campaigns leave no sexist stereotype unquestioned. Her invention is a work of feminist criticism within a work of fiction, and has itself inspired endless feminist criticism. What is more interesting about Wassermanâ€™s novel is how she attacks two other   archetypes: the good girl and the bad girl. Wasserman believes the two depend on each other for sustenance. The bad girl is a stock character so ancient that tracing its origins is both impossible and unnecessary, but Euripidesâ€™ Medea is the quintessential early example. Itâ€™s vengeance, not evil, that drives Medea to murder her own children and romantic rival after her husband Jasonâ€™s betrayal. Her crime is a refusal to quietly endure the consequences of Jasonâ€™s cruelty. Bad girls arenâ€™t villains theyâ€™re transgressive forces within patriarchal cultures. Made to choose between wreaking destruction and accepting their own powerlessness, they pick destruction. Classic literature often pairs bad girls with good girls  â€”   who are not always kindhearted, but do adhere to societyâ€™s rules for women. The bad girl tends to serve a dual function in these stories, as a cautionary tale and an obstacle the good girl must clear to obtain the object of her affection. Mad Berthaâ€™s fiery suicide frees up Rochester to marry Jane Eyre.   Countess Olenska in Edith Whartonâ€™s The Age of Innocence cedes her beloved Newland Archer to her proper cousin May Welland, but not without some manipulation on Mayâ€™s part. The bad girl either dies or fades into the background in the end, and the good girl lives happily (or boringly) ever after. From Vanity Fair to Gossip Girl, friendships between good girls and bad girls are by no means rare, either. In Thackerayâ€™s satirical novel, scheming social climber Becky Sharp attaches herself to  â€”   and sometimes plays architect to the life of  â€”   rich, dull Amelia Sedley. Cecily von Ziegesarâ€™s Gossip Girl series takes a page from Wharton, pairing up effortlessly heartbreaking bad girl Serena van der Woodson and Blair Waldorf, a   good girl who is also a   mean girl. Lacey and Hannahâ€™s friendship first takes the broad shape of a romance. Furtive glances across the classroom lead up to a fateful meeting in the nurseâ€™s office. After an episode of   humiliation straight out of Carrie, a teary and   Hannah observes that pale,   Lacey smells â€œlike Christmas, ginger and clovesâ€ and worries sheâ€™ll lose her interest with a single dim comment. They cement their connection with   drives across state lines. Lacey rechristens her protÃ©gÃ© â€œDexâ€ and intoxicates her with drugs, boys, rock shows, and Satanic rituals. (â€œDexâ€ canâ€™t quite discern how sincere Lacey is about the latter.)  So far, their story hews close to the standard      narrative  â€”   with Wasserman interrupting the charactersâ€™ accelerated journey to intimacy, every few pages, to plant some alarming omen. But unlike so many classic examples of the trope, Girls on Fire isnâ€™t a social procedural. Its primary concern isnâ€™t how a good girlâ€™s fate might come to be entwined with a bad girlâ€™s. By instead asking why, it calls attention to rarely discussed attributes of both character types. Bad girls like Dangerous Liaisonsâ€™ Marquise de Merteuil unconsciously set themselves up to fail, ignoring possible paths to happiness in the course of   following impossible ones. For good girls  â€”   Dangerous Liaisons has Madame de Tourvel and CÃ©cile de Volanges  â€”   virtue tends to mask some blankness or hollowness at their very core. When theyâ€™re not looking to a man for purpose, theyâ€™re looking to a bad girl to supply them with a personality.  Then comes the inevitable    moment, after Hannahâ€™s naivety prevents her from fully comprehending how vulnerable Lacey is at home. Lacey leaves her friend to fend for herself at a party hurtling toward drunken chaos. Itâ€™s uncommon for a good girl to be tested this way  â€”   to find herself in a tense situation without a bad girl to navigate her towards safety or danger, to have to make the choice herself.  â€œLacey had told me of quantum incompatibilities, qualities so opposed to each other that the very existence of one eliminated the possibility of the other,â€ Hannah recounts in one early, lyrical passage. I could recognize Laceyâ€™s presence in my bedroom as its ultimate illustration, Laceyâ€™s combat boots crushing my turquoise shag carpeting, her eyes alighting briefly on the stuffed turtle I still kept tucked between my pillows, Hannah Dexterâ€™s past and future in a doomed collision, matter and antimatter collapsing into a black hole that would consume us both. Translation: I was pretty sure that once Lacey saw me in my natural habitat, she would disappear. Hannah has a knack for making false assumptions, and sheâ€™s dead wrong here. Lacey isnâ€™t antimatter. She doesnâ€™t disappear. The bad girl happily acclimates to the good girlâ€™s environment. Later, the good girl will have an opportunity to permanently relocate to the bad girlâ€™s domain. Itâ€™s essential and rare that the decision is hers to make, just like it was at the party. Literatureâ€™s bad girls have  â€”   or seize  â€”   the agency to make choices. That, more than anything else, is what distinguishes them from good girls. Whereas Lacey and Medea and Jane Eyreâ€™s Bertha create their own alternatives when theyâ€™re backed into a corner, good girls with plenty of options tend to move in whatever direction theyâ€™re pushed. They are almost always manipulated or forced or tugged along by the dictates of propriety.

politifact15623,https://www.chicagosuntimes.live/queen-elizabeth-says-muslim-refugees-are-dividing-nationality-i-fully-agree-with-donald-trump-we-shouldvideo/,"Queen Elizabeth Says: “Muslim Refugees Are Dividing Nationality, I Fully Agree With Donald Trump We Should…”(VIDEO)","It takes a few episodes of Better Things, the new FX comedy about an actor raising her three daughters in LA, to realize that there arenâ€™t really any men in the series. Something similar dawns on you watching Atlanta, another new FX comedy about two cousins trying to make it in the southern entertainment Meccaâ€™s   scene  â€”   except instead of men being absent it is white characters. Once you notice that these mainstays of traditional TV sitcoms arenâ€™t here  â€”   as extinct as the dodo or Ryan Lochteâ€™s endorsement deals  â€”   you also realize that you donâ€™t much miss them. There are some men in Better Things, of course, but they are relegated to the minor roles usually reserved for women in comedyâ€™s boysâ€™ club: romantic interests and   shopkeepers and other such functionaries. To make the contrast even starker, the main character, Sam (Pamela Adlon) and her three daughters, Max (Mikey Madison) Frankie (Hannah Alligood) and Duke (Olivia Edward) all have dudesâ€™ names.  The white people in Atlanta  â€”   and there are even fewer of them than there are men in Better Things  â€”   serve the same purpose that black actors do on other comedies. That is, they serve to make a point about race in America, before disappearing. For instance, a white colleague is seen to use the   around the main character, Earnest (Donald Glover) but not around his much more physically imposing cousin Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) or their gonzo friend Darius (Keith Stanfield). The lack of such characters allows these new, fresh voices to be heard  â€”   and in both shows, theyâ€™re vibrant and engrossing. Better Things is a product of the partnership between Adlon and Louis CK  â€”   Adlon served as both a writer and   on Louie for several seasons and as CKâ€™s wife on the   HBO comedy Lucky Louie. They created this show together (both serve as either writer or director of many of the episodes) and it shares lots in its DNA with CKâ€™s signature creation. Not only is Better Things about an entertainer trying to raise a group of daughters itâ€™s also an occasionally meandering, philosophical series of vignettes. Adlonâ€™s character, Sam, is much more sympathetic and    than the Pamela we met on Louie. Just as CK is famous for his riff about how his kids are assholes, Sam has the same sort of antagonistic relationship with her children, scoffing at her oldest daughter when she asks her to score pot but then stealing the condom she finds under her daughterâ€™s nightstand for an assignation with a married man.  While there are some   moments of feminism, like Samâ€™s speech at a women and girlsâ€™ empowerment seminar at her daughterâ€™s school, Better Things is searching for a deeper meaning in how to navigate the world as a woman at all stages of life, both the good and the bad. Imagine Inside Amy Schumer were it half as didactic and twice as melancholy. While it sometimes can veer into familiar territories of sitcom schmaltz, Better Things offers essential fresh takes on motherhood, Hollywood and the vagaries of teenage life. Atlanta is as concerned with race as Better Things is about gender. In the showâ€™s second episode, when Earnest finds himself in jail (not to be confused with Ernest Goes to Jail) he sees an inmate who is clearly mentally ill. When the cops say the inmate is imprisoned every week, Earnest wonders why they keep locking him up instead of getting him help. The cops treat him gently until he drinks toilet water and spits it at them then they viciously beat him. Itâ€™s comical, harrowing, audacious and sobering all at the same time.  That is what makes Atlanta an even better show than Better Things  â€”   in fact, one of the best new shows on television in quite some time. Glover is the star and creator of what feels a little bit like a   Girls. Earnest is barely employed, broke, and â€œtechnically homelessâ€ as he pursues his dreams of being a rap manager while trying to raise his daughter. Like Lena Dunham, Glover is obviously playing a much less successful and ambitious version of himself.  While Atlantaâ€™s observations are as keen as those in Better Things, the show is much more consistent in its laughs and tone. Atlanta also tackles a variety of subjects almost effortlessly, whether itâ€™s homophobia and transphobia, the cycle of poverty, or the fraught relationship between law enforcement and the black community. Just as in real life, these issues can creep up anywhere and at any time, and Atlanta always has smart things to say about them.  Everything about this program seems new and vital, stylishly shot in hues that make the projects of Atlanta look like they were washed over with honeycomb and steeped in sunlight. The same is true of Better Things. This is a great step for FX, whose recent comedy duds, such as Baskets and SexDrugsRockRoll, deliver the same angsty   schtick that is pervasive in the world of     comedy. Though these new shows share little more than a network, they are also united in their desire to lend a voice to stories that are often ignored or marginalized. Theyâ€™re both so darn good, audiences might start demanding fewer white guys in just about everything.",344,180,"1016504784113655808	1016557692104728576	1016587687602671616	1017243474998038529	1017826100544704514	1017847804339867650	1017849617839460357	1017853661588918272	1026121288224595968",fake

Former students from as far back as the 1940s joined current students, faculty and staff for what was widely expected to be a celebration of their most famous alumnaâ€™s biggest night. The largely female crowd of about 3, 000 snacked on cupcakes topped with shards of candy glass ceiling (clear, flat sugar) and snapped group selfies with the Clinton cardboard cutouts decorating the arena. They also took pictures of themselves grabbing the crotches of the Donald Trump and Mike Pence cutouts. Graduating senior Caroline Bechtel, who will serve as a second lieutenant in the army after she finishes officer training school in 2017, talked about her relief that the election season was over and that Clinton would be president. Her classmate Zainab Younus, who is majoring in international relations, said how exciting it had been to be with her politically engaged classmates supporting Clintonâ€™s campaign. Then the results started rolling in. By 9. 30pm, the guests seated in the front of the collegeâ€™s field house  â€”   watching the results on CNN and in a position to hear the commentary  â€”   looked much tenser than the ones still standing in line for the bar and partying in the back of the room. Lindsay Miller, a class of 1969 schoolmate of Clintonâ€™s, and the former editor of their college newspaper, explained that when it comes to Clinton and Trump, â€œitâ€™s no contest, but it looks like thereâ€™s a contest, and that says something about our country. â€ â€œWhat weâ€™re seeing is a serious, serious split,â€ Miller, a journalist, said. Graduating senior Amal Cheema said much the same. â€œAs the polls came in, I was seeing how much division and disagreement there is in America. â€ By 10. 22pm, after the predicted Clinton blowout had failed to materialize and everyone was settling in for a close race, Wellesleyâ€™s other famous Democratic alumna, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, addressed the cheering audience remotely. â€œNothing comes easy for women. But I think sheâ€™ll pull it out,â€ she told them. Four minutes later, the audience booed the announcement that Trump had won Ohio. As state after state went for Trump, people began making discreet exits. Ten minutes after results showed the Republican candidate up in Iowa, a young woman was visibly in tears, being comforted by her friends. She wouldnâ€™t be the last. The fluorescent lights came on at the back of the field house an hour and several more electoral votes for Trump later. Around the room, women were comforting one another as despondent face found despondent face. A biracial lesbian couple were holding on to each other, with a visceral sense of defeat. Shortly after midnight, when CNN showed Trump pulling away from Clinton in Pennsylvania, a few women shouted â€œNo!â€ and â€œWhy?â€ at no one in particular, as the catering staff packed up the bar and dispatched the remains of the cheese plates and buffet sandwiches. More and more women could be seen crying on one anotherâ€™s shoulders, while one group of women (and a couple of male friends) gave the middle finger to CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper on the large screen. Younus, the graduating senior who had started the night so excited by the thought of a Clinton win, stood in the middle of the room, alone, with her arms crossed across her chest. â€œHow are we supposed to predict anything?â€ she asked rhetorically, and then refused to answer any more questions. Tempestt Morgan  â€”   who had been hoping against hope for a Clinton victory at 12. 30am  â€”   was not optimistic about the America into which she would be entering as a college graduate next May. â€œEven if [Clinton] somehow makes it back from this, itâ€™s still sad to see so many people aligned with a candidate like [Trump]â€ she said. Her friend, Jekia Brockman, looked around at the women crying  â€”   one of whom flopped over dramatically as yet another state was said to be leaning Trump  â€”   and said: â€œItâ€™s not unbelievable. Itâ€™s completely believable. â€ Just before 1. 30am, as the group of (mostly) students watching the results had dwindled to a couple of hundred, the Wellesley president, Paula Johnson, took the stage. â€œWhatever the result, we stand for justice,â€ she said. â€œWe stand for equality for every one, no matter your gender, your race, your sexual orientation or your religion, no matter what country youâ€™re from or what your immigration status is. â€ â€œWe must be part of the momentum that takes us forward from hereâ€ she added, after a standing ovation. â€œWe will be here together in the morningâ€ she said. And then, just minutes before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wellesley College shut down the news feed, and sent their students and guests

politifact13765,https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836/http://thetrumpmedia.com:80/politics/mccain-blamed-sabotaging-trump,McCain Blamed For Sabotaging Trump,"A prominent law firm is taking   legal action against the government, following the EU referendum result, to try to ensure article 50 is not triggered without an act of parliament.  Acting on behalf of an anonymous group of clients, solicitors at Mishcon de Reya have been in contact with government lawyers to seek assurances over the process, and plan to pursue it through the courts if they are not satisfied. The law firm has retained the services of senior constitutional barristers, including Lord Pannick QC and Rhodri Thompson QC. Their initiative relies upon the ambiguous wording of article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which sets out how states could leave the EU. The first clause declares: â€œAny member state may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. â€ One of the grounds of a likely challenge to the referendum is that it is merely advisory and the royal prerogative cannot be used to undermine parliamentary statute. According to Mishcon de Reya, the decision to trigger article 50 rests with the representatives of the people under the UK constitution. The firm has been in correspondence with the government since 27 June â€œto seek assurances that the government will uphold the UK constitution and protect the sovereignty of parliament in invoking article 50â€. Kasra Nouroozi, a partner at Mishcon de Reya, said: â€œWe must ensure that the government follows the correct process to have legal certainty and protect the UK constitution and the sovereignty of parliament in these unprecedented circumstances. The result of the referendum is not in doubt, but we need a process that follows UK law to enact it. The outcome of the referendum itself is not legally binding and for the current or future prime minister to invoke article 50 without the approval of parliament is unlawful. â€œWe must make sure this is done properly for the benefit of all UK citizens. Article 50 simply cannot be invoked without a full debate and vote in parliament. Everyone in Britain needs the government to apply the correct constitutional process and allow parliament to fulfil its democratic duty, which is to take into account the results of the referendum along with other factors and make the ultimate decision. â€ The UK does not have a formal written constitution, so some lawyers have been dismissive of the legality of legal intervention, while others have been pressing for clearer guidance on the constitutional procedure.  Another legal initiative began last week to seek an opinion on whether the advisory status of the referendum means that it should be the prime minister or parliament that ultimately pulls the trigger on article 50.  A tax barrister, Jolyon Maugham QC, has launched a crowdfunding campaign on CrowdJustice to pay for advice from constitutional law experts. â€œThis is an incredibly important moment in our nationâ€™s history,â€ Maugham said. â€œEveryone  â€”   those who voted both leave and remain  â€”   is entitled to be sure of the constitutional basis for removing the UK from the EU. â€",982,834,"828100305547980800	828103835985993728	828122819968004098	828127868257345536	828146331227144192	828147460501561344	828249314443067392	828251918745100289	828254909929836547	828263566948126721	828265477797392384	828269500697026562	828271664198725633	828291912096362497	828314850547863553	828325807328210944	828372038695911424	828471951563763713	828588001710202880	828596000000528384	828720043173302273	828727569541451777	828818994232688640	828907718459215872	828944330924621824	828961257587875840	828968194559709185	829000283795628032	829001344639983616	829018282468323328	829029251563319296	829112677024804864	829118084900352002	829150021052465152	829184204793577472	829214608598691845	829239964550447105	829240199699894273	829295527518953472	829391826461347840	829429226701017088	829676531739983873	829699175369601027	832267065994027008	832279366126202880	832284020956291072	832312918498750464	832313771439845376	832314025564217345	832314030127718400	832314949741400064	832316982980521984	832317496766119941	832317538553835520	832318175492476928	832322110919815168	832359326379626496	832503282954285057	836036647053578240	857954549331611648	929027428772646912",fake
politifact14624,http://www.react365.com,Create a Prank and trick your friends,"If you have been around for a sufficient number of years to indulge in this experiment, compare yourself at 18 to yourself at the age of 34. Perhaps your ambitions and attitudes have changed over that time, and maybe your voting behavior has too. Contemplating the first 16 years of adulthood, leads to a pretty obvious question: how useful is the term â€œmillennialâ€ anyway? When it comes to understanding whether people will vote and how theyâ€™ll vote, it turns out the    age bracket has limited value. Thatâ€™s not just because people change. Itâ€™s also because the defining trait of millennials (from a demographerâ€™s perspective at least) is diversity. For every 100 millennials, 44 are part of a minority race or ethnic group according to the Census Bureauâ€™s latest figures. For every 100 Americans age 85 and over, just 11 arenâ€™t white. And, since race is one of the best predictors of voting intention in the US, it might make a lot more sense to slice up this demographic rather than treating it as one, uniform voting bloc. But thatâ€™s not how polling works. If you only have about a thousand people to try to predict national voting behavior, you can only interpret basic information. Imagine the alternative: if you used a survey to understand how      black women in America will vote, at best youâ€™d probably be anticipating the behavior of tens of thousands of women based on just one personâ€™s answer. Not great. Once you average out all the nuanced differences between millennials, polling still reveals a difference between them and other age groups. According to analysis from the LA Times (which has its limitations) Americans of all ages are more likely to think that Democrat Hillary Clinton will win this election than believe Donald Trump will (currently, 50% expect a Clinton win compared to 45% who think Trump will win). But those views are weakest among millennials  â€”   polling suggests this age group is almost evenly split over who they think will win. That could be because Americans aged 18 to 34 are more likely than older voters to consider a   alternative (many were forced to reconsider their options after their   candidate, Democrat Bernie Sanders, dropped out of the presidential race). Thereâ€™s good news and bad news for Clinton. The good news: because age groups are more evenly distributed across the country than racial groups, millennials might not be able to swing a bunch of states. But the bad news is that some millennials might be telling pollsters that they doubt a Democratic win because they donâ€™t quite tell the truth in other survey questions about how theyâ€™ll vote or whether theyâ€™ll vote. If young Americans donâ€™t feel comfortable telling a stranger that they want to vote for Trump or donâ€™t plan on voting at all, then Clinton could be in even deeper trouble in November than first appears.",308,577,"791336784311554048	791350035233595392	791356773814984708	791373334017703937	791378854166274049	791384886066106368	791408088142053376	791411827087437824	791413776549605376	791415377662210058	791426104485638144	791427535057846272	791431477036736512	791433066359189505	791435000398942212	791442430071492608	791446256212115456	791446495039860736	791453561859309568	791462258379526145	791463636090908673	791469395121934337	791471248249237504	791476983326732288	791478263566704640	791481871490310144	791487625152593920	791498926658555904	791503392715726848	791508158283976704	791508486018465792	791532612124872704	791542769093382144	791587543741521920	791619454882938880	791636038397599744	791649507402477568	791658114445668352	791661291752550400	791667243562270720	791671623241850880	791686592926740480	791691582332252161	791694699161530368	791694707986358273	791695239362863105	791707261118939136	791720848277303296	791721209884991488	791725820998025220	791732104811913216	791735861956272130	791743121650544640	791748077887426566	791754220424818688	791755861064462336	791758046963859456	791761557583646720	791764625960407040	791767033365102592	791783841958690816	791787623920635904	791789052760555521	791789740844523520	791795376760258560	791799785800003588	791801117009215488	791806042732572672	791808024004403200	791815988547289088	791826408293171201	791832182469844992	791849504538583041	791915239956766721	791916219590807556	791954661532049412	791969173685567488	791969568000540672	792012733252300800	792015729138671616	792042034379026432	792063455998124032	792102440698949632	792123098795474945	792142832802729984	792241203240693760	792355318608953344	792355416315301888	792429599166574593	792480034598432769	792804140573306880	793129224399826944	797803685363535873	797882250075348993	797882282262593536	798553691032719360	805491616291180544	807629328741646336	809316734431793153	809513314938195968	841340086566436864	893989167331520516",fake
politifact14155,http://patriotcrier.com/1-6kk-0/,"BOMBSHELL: COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY","One evening in 2014, Sharon Horgan met Sarah Jessica Parker for dinner. After making her name in a show about sex and thankless dating, Parker wanted to make a programme about   relationships  â€”   she was a fan of Horganâ€™s Pulling, and the two had started tentative talks about working together on a show about a long and painful divorce. They ordered food. Horgan was overdressed and far from home. Born in 1970, she grew up on a turkey farm in County Meath. At 19 she moved to London, where she lives today with her   husband and two daughters (Sadhbh is 12 and Amer seven) on the edge of an   common that, on warm days, smells sweetly of marijuana. In the restaurant, Horgan and Parker talked about their children (Parker has two daughters and a son) and how it felt to be away from them. They talked about the stress of fitting filming in around school schedules, and the questions people ask, and the expectations strangers have of the guilt a working mother is meant to feel and then the guilt inspired by those expectations. â€œHours later we looked up and realised,â€ Horgan says, â€œthat weâ€™d spent the whole meal talking about the  â€¦     the qualifying we had to do before we could even get to the work, things that a man would never even consider. A man, at a meeting about a TV show, would surely have just been looking straight ahead, into the future. â€ They made a decision. â€œNext time a woman tells you they have a big job, weâ€™d just say: â€˜Good on you!â€™ Rather than: â€˜I donâ€™t know how you do it. â€™â€ They made two decisions. The second was to produce a TV show. For British fans, there is sure to be a quiet feeling of reflected pride at Sharon Horganâ€™s slow, steady rise to become one of the most   scriptwriters in the world. Fans who have followed Horganâ€™s work from the first minutes of Pulling, where we meet Donna (Horganâ€™s character) in bed as she gives her fiancÃ© Karl a sluggish handjob before he politely tells her that he finished some time ago. He plucks a leaf from a nearby   wipes himself off, and drops it behind the bed. Fans who are interested to see how her comedy  â€”   her brittle women, her soft men, the particular brand of romantic tragedy she has created  â€”   will translate to HBO. Itâ€™s a warm afternoon and she greets me on her doorstep having just cycled home from a day writing the third series of Catastrophe with Rob Delaney. The two met on Twitter, and their sitcom, loosely based on Horganâ€™s own experience of getting pregnant early into a relationship, (its title was taken from a line in Zorba the Greek: â€œIâ€™m a man, so I married. Wife, children, house, everything. The full catastropheâ€) has won an embarrassment of awards. â€œOne thing about her that Iâ€™ve had to learn to live with is that she eats faster than a piranha,â€ Delaney tells me later. â€œShe just tosses the food in her face and is, like, â€˜Back to work!â€™ And Iâ€™ve taken two bites of my sandwich. But honestly thatâ€™s part of whatâ€™s great about working with her. Yes, sheâ€™s funny, but so are a lot of people itâ€™s her work ethic that is so great. Whatever bad thing happened in her childhood to make her afraid to sit back and relax has been a huge benefit to me personally. â€ She falls into an armchair in her   living room, and crosses all her limbs. Horgan doesnâ€™t love interviews. Sheâ€™s better at writing than talking, she says. But the more success she has, the more she has to talk. Does she feel like sheâ€™s made it? She holds her head. â€œDid you read that interview recently with [Sightseers  ] Alice Lowe, whose new film has just premiered at Venice? She was talking about how creatively fertile she feels and how she knows her best work is ahead of her. And reading that I felt so jealous. â€ Jealous? â€œIâ€™d love to have that feeling! Iâ€™m more like: â€˜Shit, what if I never make anything decent ever again?â€™ I definitely felt that way after Pulling  â€”   like that was the best thing Iâ€™d ever make. It took a while to shift that. â€ Pulling, the show she created with   Dennis Kelly, aired in 2006. â€œWriting with Sharon requires proper honesty,â€ Kelly tells me. â€œItâ€™s like therapy. But also a real laugh. Sheâ€™s why Iâ€™m still writing, really. [Heâ€™s currently working on Brad Pittâ€™s movie series, the sequel to World War Z] She runs at something, just to see what happens. Which isnâ€™t to say sheâ€™s  . In fact, I think one of the reasons she likes to collaborate is that sheâ€™s slightly insecure that sheâ€™s not good enough. Which, of course, is bizarre. â€ Working with Delaney, Horgan says, softens her sharp edges, whereas Kelly helps access her â€œbrutalityâ€. â€œThere was a period after Pulling when work slowed down for Sharon,â€ Kelly says. Then when Catastrophe became an overnight hit (originally turned down by the BBC, Channel 4 renewed it for a second series before the first had finished, recommissioning a further two in July) Horgan was suddenly â€œhotâ€. â€œBut she genuinely doesnâ€™t put more stock into this big HBO work than the smaller stuff she makes,â€ Kelly adds. The two reunited recently for a Channel 4   called The Circuit, a dark comedy about a dinner party. It aired shortly before Motherland, a pilot Horgan wrote with Graham Linehan about the bleak reality of being a parent. On the school run that week, Horgan says, she worried the other mums might â€œthink Iâ€™d been trolling themâ€. All this as they wrapped on Divorce. Sheâ€™s busy. Kelly first realised Horgan was becoming a big deal when he was on the phone to her as she walked down the street, and he heard a stranger thank her for her work. It happens a lot. â€œOne of the biggest pleasures is when women contact me about the character Sharon in Catastrophe,â€ Horgan says, â€œthanking me for putting her on television. Someone who was fucking up, making mistakes, and still getting by. â€ All the women Horgan writes fuck up. She is a master of â€œdifficult womenâ€  â€”   from the   Donna (when her kebab is stolen, she compares the violation to the murder of an old lady) to Sharon, and now Divorceâ€™s Frances, who cheats on her husband with a literary professor. â€œI have a responsibility, I think, to make complex female characters who arenâ€™t necessarily always good people. Men have always been allowed to be flawed, and annoying, and childlike, but also allowed to make mistakes and find their way back. The great thing about writing with Sharon was that she was allowed to be all those things. A lot of me went into that character  â€”   and look, I managed to get to this point in my life  â€¦    â€ She gestures around her living room, the sound of her kids laughing out the back, the pleasing smell of a recent wood fire, â€œwithout completely alienating everyone. It can be done!â€ Watching her characters age and grow from show to show is a little like   Horganâ€™s own life, from the friendly desperation of   through to unplanned pregnancy, marriage, the boredom and anxieties of motherhood and the difficulty of staying in love. The characters have grown up because she has. â€œI look back at Donna with some nostalgia. I watched Pulling again for the first time recently, and called Dennis saying: â€˜God, we were really harsh to those characters.â€™ Would I treat a character that badly today? Wouldnâ€™t I want to give some chink of light? The funny thing is, Iâ€™m way harder now. â€ She laughs. â€œApart from that things make me cry because Iâ€™ve got kids, and that Iâ€™m aware of the desperateness of the world, Iâ€™m also hard as fuck because Iâ€™ve been through it  â€”   Iâ€™m tougher than I was back then, I donâ€™t believe anything anyone says, Iâ€™m much more cynical. â€ Thereâ€™s a knock on the door. A delivery man has a package for a few houses down  â€”   will she hold on to it for them? Sure. He returns from his van with first one parcel, then another, and another. A streetâ€™s worth of unwieldy boxes piles up behind her front door, and she calmly smiles, and waves them in. â€œWell. An opportunity to meet the neighbours!â€ she says, brightly. â€œLike any new show,â€ says Sarah Jessica Parker on email, â€œtiming is everything. I was fortunate to meet Sharon, who had so much to say about marriage, relationships and being a woman that was completely in line with the story we had been wanting to tell for years. â€ And the process of working so closely with her, she says, â€œhas been a rewarding collaboration. I couldnâ€™t be more proud. â€ Divorce is great. Itâ€™s set in winter, in a suburb of New York where couples can barely look at each other, where the snow is almost definitely a metaphor. Parker plays Frances, a typically   lovable narcissist who tells her husband (played by Thomas Haden Church) â€œI want to save my life while I still care about it. â€ â€œI was fascinated by the idea of divorce,â€ Horgan says. â€œI wanted to see how it works. What are the obstacles to splitting up, how do peopleâ€™s feelings shift? There are surely moments when you worry youâ€™re doing the wrong thing. And thereâ€™s rarely one real baddie, right?â€ Before she started writing, Horgan sat down with a friend whoâ€™d been divorced and asked her what happened. Not the familiar, we just fell out of loveâ€™s, the sad shrugs, but the real details. â€œI went: â€˜You have to tell me exactly what you said when the decision was made, and then what he replied.â€™ And then I asked what happened the next morning, and then the day after that. â€ What did she learn? â€œWell, I learned that thereâ€™s always someone who loves harder. When we were writing, the challenge was to keep the brutality while still being able to laugh at the ridiculousness, the honesty, the horror. â€ Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, said heâ€™s excited to show an authentic story. â€œItâ€™s not a Hollywoodisation of divorce,â€ he said. Heâ€™s right  â€”   the balance of deadpan humour and icy bleakness is anything but Technicolor. Despite the high production values and American accents, Divorce fits into the uncomfortable body of Horganâ€™s work in one episode, when Frances and her husband are saying a tender goodbye, he asks her to leave so he can empty his bowels. Horgan has plans for a hundred more projects, including a feature film with Delaney which, she hopes, will be â€œa short aggressive romantic taleâ€. There is a romance that runs through all her work, but one that is constantly questioned. I ask if she consciously returns to similar ideas. â€œNo. Thereâ€™s not just one thing I want to say,â€ she replies. â€œNot to be a wanker, but I do have a different thesis for each story. For Catastrophe now, itâ€™s the idea that when you stay in a long relationship youâ€™re not whole any more, and accepting this is what allows you to move forward. You become them. With Divorce itâ€™s about trying to find the person you were before you got married, and dealing with the realisation they no longer exist. â€ She raises her eyebrows and chuckles. There is only one message, she says, that she returns to on purpose. â€œThat itâ€™s not a bad thing to be a strong woman. In the second series of Catastrophe Sharon says: â€˜Not everyone has to like you  â€¦     I have earned the right to have people dislike me. â€™â€ Does she feel the same? She thinks for a second, and seems surprised to hear herself say: â€œYes. â€ She shrugs. â€œLike me, none of my characters are scared to say: â€˜Take it or leave it. This is who I am. â€™â€  Divorce starts on 11 October at 10. 10pm on Sky Atlantic",962,583,"864604602548846592	864616738825973760	864616741514510336	864616747885748224	864616762121244672	864618959500455938	864629419989770242	864656669757894661	864657194003775488	864658995805605888	864663803543289857	864664359359873024	864721588301811712	864722018062782466	864742868597985281	864759694413504512	864820439037739008	864838369112543232	864974287324684288	864998412181045248	865062102951751681	865198995890728960	865326785373892608	865481409795719169	865585010484445185	865592958665584646	865679030070071297	867804174381191169	867879926946516992	868186042217660419	868264804728918016	868546671088721920	872220976750186496",fake

Derek Hunt, owner of the Sable Ranch film set, said the fire came down the hillside towards the site â€œlike a freight trainâ€. â€œUnfortunately you can only do so much when it is a horrific fire storm,â€ he told NBC Los Angeles. â€œAt some point you know youâ€™re defeated and you have to step back and save what you can. â€ Hedren, who famously shared her family home with a lion when her daughter, Melanie Griffith, was a teenager, founded the Shambala Preserve in 1972. Itâ€™s home to several species of endangered big cats, including African lions, leopards and a Bengal tiger. Griffith tweeted her concern about Hedren and her livestock early on Sunday morning. She subsequently expressed her relief that her mother and the big cats were safe.  More than 1, 600 firefighters continue to battle the blaze. They are struggling to contain a fire that some are calling the most extreme they have seen in decades.  â€œThe fireâ€™s just doing what it wants right now,â€ said US Forest Service spokesman Nathan Judy. â€œWe have to stick back, let it do what it wants to and attack it where we can. â€",261,333,,fake

The dispute over the â€œnapalm girlâ€ image, which a Norwegian writer published in a post about historic warfare photography, ended Friday when Facebook reversed its decision, acknowledging the â€œglobal importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in timeâ€. But the spat has exposed what journalists and ethicists say are fundamental flaws in the way Facebook controls and spreads news. Critics say the companyâ€™s decisions were driven by PR concerns and should serve as a   call to free speech advocates about how powerful Facebook has become â€”   and how   the corporation is for its role, however unwilling, in journalism. Some hope the scandal will be a turning point for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who critics say has a moral obligation to recognize his role as the â€œworldâ€™s most powerful editorâ€ and take meaningful steps to make Facebook accountable for what it distributes. â€œWhat Facebook has to do now is think very hard about what it really means to be a publisher,â€ said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. â€œIf they donâ€™t,â€ she warned, â€œthis is going to happen to them over and over again. â€ Whether Facebook and media executives like to admit it, the social media site now plays a vital role in how people consume news, carrying an influence that is difficult to overstate. Studies have repeatedly found that Facebook has become the primary news source for many people, and that publishersâ€™ revenues have been hit hard as a result.  To some journalists, the decline in advertising revenue is less alarming than what the row over the war photo revealed: Facebookâ€™s control over the news has become so vast that it could censor stories in ways that deeply threaten the free press. Whether Facebook knows what to do with that power is an open question. â€œItâ€™s almost like these are kids playing with a toy above their age bracket,â€ said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. â€œWe surely need something more than just algorithms. We need people who are sentient beings who will actually stop and analyze these things. â€ Zuckerberg has refused to acknowledge that Facebook is a publisher or media company, instead sticking to the labels of â€œtech companyâ€ and â€œplatformâ€. But the idea of an unbiased platform was recently called into question when it was revealed that Facebook staff curated news articles in its â€œtrendingâ€ section. The company then fired the team that managed the trending pieces and let an algorithm take over, and Facebook immediately began pushing fake and vulgar stories into usersâ€™ feeds. â€œFacebook wants to have the responsibility of a publisher but also to be seen as a neutral carrier of information that is not in the position of making news judgments,â€ said Jim Newton, a former Los Angeles Times editor who teaches journalism ethics at the University of California, Los Angeles. â€œI donâ€™t know how they are going to be able to navigate that in the long term. â€ Bell said Facebook was a â€œspectacularly well resourced and brilliant organization from a technological perspectiveâ€  â€”   and that its editorial efforts should start to reflect that rigor and dedication. Some have called for someone responsible for tough newsroom decisions to take over: an editor in duties and title. â€œFacebook needs an editor  â€”   to stop Facebook from editing,â€ Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor at the City University of New York, wrote on Friday. â€œIt needs someone to save Facebook from itself by bringing principles to the discussion of rules. â€ Jarvis argued that Facebook should allow editors of reputable news organizations to make key decisions related to how they use the platform  â€”   such as publishing a war photo that may technically violate policy. A Facebook editor could intervene when there are disagreements, he said. Edward Wasserman, dean of the University of California, Berkeley journalism school, said Facebook should create a team of journalists to address these complex issues  â€”   instead of reacting on reflex when a mistake goes viral. â€œIf they are in the news business, which they are, then they have to get into the world of editorial judgement. â€  To some in media, a key first step to making Facebook a respectable news publisher is increased transparency. Aside from leaked documents, the public knows little about how Facebookâ€™s algorithms work and what role employees play. Both algorithms and editors can be heavily biased, and until Facebook is more open about how and why certain news stories are permitted and promoted, the company will continue to earn the ire of journalists, whose stories can live or die by Facebook. â€œFacebook and Google are like black boxes. Nobody understands the algorithms except the people inside,â€ said Jonathan Taplin, former director of the University of Southern Californiaâ€™s Annenberg Innovation Lab. Without knowledge of how Facebook determines a war photo is pornographic, there is an assumption that a machine or an ignorant   staffer made the call  â€”   and there is no one to hold accountable.  â€œIt was probably a human who is 22 years old and has no fucking idea about the importance of the [napalm] picture,â€ Taplin said. While news organizations like the Guardian operate as a public trust, Facebook has a different agenda, he added. He noted that the Facebook board continues to include Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire who secretly funded a lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker. Still, itâ€™s in Facebookâ€™s best interest in the long run to become a reliable and reputable system for news, said Kathleen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of  . â€œFacebook is trying to deliver a platform that people want to advertise on,â€ she said, â€œand [one that] users want to be on. â€ Culver compared the network to MySpace, which had failed to attract ad revenue because it was so unregulated and chaotic. A Vietnam war image would not discourage advertisers or users, she said, but a constant stream of fake or obscene stories can be a legitimate turnoff.  â€œIf I go right now to trending topics, I guarantee I can find you conspiracy theories [and] misinformation,â€ said Culver. On Friday, when Facebook was still censoring the photo of    Kim PhÃºc running away from a napalm attack, the siteâ€™s trending bar began posting something indisputably offensive  â€”   a story suggesting that the September 11 terrorist attacks were caused by a â€œcontrolled demolitionâ€. While Facebook has vowed to discuss the matter with publishers, journalists said the case highlighted the importance of media pressure on the social media giant to rethink its practices. The blistering open letter by Espen Egil Hansen, editor of Aftenposten, the Norwegian paper that launched the controversy, offered a strong blueprint for how media should push back against Facebook censorship, Culver said. â€œItâ€™s very important for journalists and news organizations to be fully defending free expression. â€ News outlets including the Guardian, the Washington Post, Time and NBC posted articles with the napalm photo on their Facebook pages after Hansenâ€™s   rebuke of Zuckerberg began to spread. â€œMore and more people have to stand up and say this is not the role that Facebook should have,â€ Taplin said. But although the Aftenposten letter pushed Facebook to back down, Wasserman remained perturbed by the companyâ€™s intransigence. â€œIt shouldnâ€™t take a   expression of disgust,â€ he said, â€œto get their attention. â€",111,915,"924071670725402625	931360407020859392	931423860259459072	931617910979575809	931627095092023297	931628558539264001	931633296479604736	931678815704834048	931698388164366336	931710269188911105	931711673240612864	931725786146574337	931748239253979141	931759937524588544	931768908905832449	931782589358264321	931831569613979648	931873542169354241	931876003416367104	931876680397881345	931878531784695808	931904945909092352	931923684939329536	931927653606498304	931980085002952710	932009904637751301	932030457474150400	932031852344328192	932060169151893505	932091309661102081	932096105411641344	932185030637555712	932203253743411200	932266310762991616	932272626696970240	932278276910747648	932282490424664066	932319561097105408	932331431895977987	932391675531378688	932393073807691776	932408573187026944	932413422834192384	932432484276502528	932435257902723073	932439819262877696	932442647146483712	932447042055520256	932450278288146432	932456222103498753	932458314167996421	932459310721875968	932470464945016832	932490434479353856	932514956372791301	932520049625255936	932536991220150272	932554519698989057	932559403034832896	932561949954658304	932569062336618496	932583624758714368	932594306849955841	932596942722486272	932598693630537728	932604379244519424	932607378687692800	932612886530273280	932615118189314048	932616694559903744	932617190427148291	932623137111293952	932627692356362244	932628997489471488	932629952192643072	932630390510161920	932631427899944960	932634015068184582	932637962772160513	932640127196844032	932641772425154562	932642910872489989	932646978969890817	932649780525785088	932650707748040704	932655311382556674	932655554283081730	932655941937455104	932656139891871744	932656858715783169	932656989842403329	932666415936655362	932676156620337152	932676525895421952	932679685695332352	932682005959016448	932684507534299137	932684722987204608	932684789508960258	932689133859983360	932689568213581824	932692761253474307	932701888209829889	932710543907049473	932714739775414272	932723193084874754	932748953380114433	932771201323294721	932782222532255744	932809689120813056	932814987139207168	932831234933297152	932842246524641280	932844996595798016	932847323675164672	932965986570977280	932992238963093507	932994964539179009	933038628766453762	933424723471593472	933425319217856512	933510524226203648	933535453936054272	933570748878376960	933570777957384192	933612084306128896	933633791133929472	933670138263588864	933906758828883968	934090140271693825	934451251068235776	934782971017613312	935251805906149376	935252398704033794	935255525633249281	935269540438691843	935269619690065923	935269674949812224	935274780596625409	935286013903204354	935289337821978624	935502889589575686	935512089577259008	936102724646576128	936736385180012549	936802016113782784	936956507824054272	937301056123367424	937312713935646720	938447754677899264	939118157742116864	940014101731991553	941294542082445312	941488985532260352	941613045503152128	950562008734121985	951803536614019073	952523044450390016	952523066864816128	952645327093485568	953258936974692352	953259013432659968	955163868652810244	955659328844894208	956298322117124099	958117819937325056	960226337398116354	960293146520424450	978603346645921793	978912550682152960	979689660250279938	979783486465814528	1002622799612076032	1002623013378899968	1018872206825226240",fake
politifact14896,http://www.bluedotdaily.com/trump-police-officers-and-firefighters-make-too-much-money-hits-them-with-tax-penalty/,"Police Officers, Firefighters and Others Get Hit with Tax Penalty","A 2011 Ohio abortion restriction which supporters touted as a health measure had no perceptible benefits for womenâ€™s safety and drastically reduced the number and effectiveness of abortions by medication, according to a new study published in PLOS Medicine. The study scrutinized the impact of requirements for abortion providers to strictly adhere to the Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s labelling for mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. In recent years, several conservative states have enacted such requirements, citing womenâ€™s safety.  But mainstream medical groups say the evidence shows the FDA guidelines are outdated and recommend abortion providers prescribe the pills according to the latest evidence. The old regimen is more costly, less effective, and more cumbersome for patients. And abortion rights advocates have argued that laws like Ohioâ€™s are thinly veiled attempts to limit an easy method of abortion.  Lending some credence to their arguments, the new study found that the number of women having abortions by using medication cratered after the law took effect.  In 2010, the year before the law was in place, 22% of all abortions in Ohio were medication abortions. In the three years after, only 5% were. The number of women obtaining medication abortions was so small, in fact, that it took Dr Ushma Upadhyay, the researcher who conducted the study, three years after the law took effect to collect a representative sample size. The law can also be associated with â€œmore visits, more   and higher costs for women compared to before the lawâ€ the study said. After the new rules took effect, women using the abortion pill were three times more likely to need additional treatment  â€”   another dose of medication or a surgical procedure  â€”   to end their pregnancies.  Women reported experiencing more   of the drugs, notably nausea or vomiting. And because the outdated drug regimen calls for a higher dose of one of the drugs, medication abortion cost women $125 more, on average. At the same time, the study found, Ohioâ€™s   law wasnâ€™t associated with safer abortions. â€œThere is no evidence that the change in law led to improved abortion outcomes,â€ the author wrote. â€œIndeed, our findings suggest the opposite. â€ â€œRetrospectively, you can see these laws were ridiculous,â€ said Beverly Winikoff, the president of Gynuity Health Projects, which researches ways to make the abortion pill more widely available. â€œThese laws were paraded around as somehow being better for women when there was no and still is no evidence that the things this law did would have made abortion safer. â€ â€œNo matter how hard you look, you canâ€™t find any benefit for women,â€ she continued. â€œNot for their health, not for their pocketbook, not for their convenience, nothing. â€ Upadhyay, a researcher with a University of California  â€”   San Francisco program, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, analyzed the medical charts of 2, 783 women who obtained medication abortions at four Ohio abortion clinics between 2010 and 2014. She expected to see some drop in the number of medication abortions, but not one this dramatic. â€œI wasnâ€™t expecting a threefold increase in the proportion of women who required additional treatments,â€ said Upadhyay. â€œBut thereâ€™s no other potential confounder that could have explained the difference. â€ The FDA approved mifepristone for sale in 2000, with a label based on European prescribing practices from the 1980s. By the time the FDA approved the label, mainstream medical groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already considered its instructions to be out of date. They encouraged abortion clinics to prescribe the pill   and according to the latest evidence, a practice which is legal and even encouraged by the FDA.  The modern prescribing guidelines called for a smaller dose of mifepristone and allowed women to take a second course of medication at home, saving them an extra trip to the doctorâ€™s office. The   guidelines also allow the pill to be prescribed later in a pregnancy.  Ohioâ€™s law is still in force, but early this year, its effects became moot. The FDA announced in March that it had approved a new label for the drug reflecting the modern prescribing guidelines. The change allowed Ohio abortion providers to resume prescribing the pill in the same way as before the law took effect.  The same was true for two other states, North Dakota and Texas, that had passed similar requirements. (Laws passed in Oklahoma, Arizona, and Arkansas are currently blocked in court.) Some abortion patients have reported a preference for the abortion pill over the surgery because they feel the medication abortion is more private. Under the modern prescribing regimen, women can take their second doses of medication at home.  But Ohioâ€™s law, said its critics, eliminated the benefits of the pill. Because a woman must take the second dose in the doctorâ€™s office, the abortion is less private and potentially more unpleasant. One abortion provider reported that, after the law forced him to use the outdated regimen, some of his patients would begin bleeding not at home but in their cars as they left his office. In Ohio, many abortion clinics stopped providing medication abortions once the law took effect, because the number of appointments required was so unwieldy. â€œIt basically defeated the purpose of the medical abortion,â€ said Sue Postal, who formerly ran an abortion clinic in Toledo and stopped providing the pill due to the law.  In states pushing similar restrictions, abortion providers have threatened to stop providing the pill out of concern that the outdated regimen is not up to the standard of care.   groups, in reaction to the study, repeated their assertions that the abortion pill is dangerous. â€œA new study by abortion industry advocates released today should be met with the same skepticism we would give to tobacco industry findings that their products are â€˜safeâ€™,â€ said Clarke Forsythe, the senior counsel for Americans United for Life, which supports restrictions on medication abortions. (In the study, Upadhyay discloses the Susan Thompson Buffet Foundation as a source of funding and states that the foundation had no role in executing the study.)  â€œChemical abortions can be very dangerous for women, and itâ€™s appropriate for state officials to protect womenâ€™s lives with   legislation,â€ Forsythe said. He cited 2, 207 cases of severe adverse events linked to mifepristone that the FDA reported in 2011.  Those cases, though, made up a fraction of women who took the pill. The number comes from an FDA a survey of 1. 52 million women who had taken mifepristone which found that only 0. 04% of cases had complications requiring hospitalization  â€”   although subsequent studies have argued that the FDA used a method that undercounted the number of complications.  Winikoff pointed out that even though the Ohio law is moot today, it still prevents Ohio abortion providers from updating their practices to reflect new evidence until the FDA approves another label for mifepristone.  Her group, Gynuity, which provided much of the evidence that prompted the FDA to update its labelling earlier this year, is currently studying the effectiveness of prescribing the pill beyond 10 weeks, and mailing the pill to women living in remote areas. Gynuityâ€™s study on prescribing the pill up to 11 weeks should be released by the end of the year. â€œStay tuned,â€ Winikoff said. â€œItâ€™s going to be interesting.

politifact13827,https://web.archive.org/web/20170307175331/http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/whoopi-goldberg-navy-seal-widow-looking-attention/,Whoopi Goldberg: Navy SEAL Widow was “Looking for Attention”,"BeyoncÃ©â€™s appearance at the Country Music Association awards (CMAs) Wednesday solidified her interest in going country since the release of Daddy Lessons, a song from Lemonade that earned some radio play on country music stations this year and was covered by the Dixie Chicks on their summer tour. The synergy continued as she teamed up with the Dixie Chicks for a   televised performance of the song that became the highlight of the night. Dressed in a long white gown to contrast the Dixie Chicks in all black, BeyoncÃ© and lead singer Natalie Maines traded verses while Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer answered on fiddle and banjo. A larger band provided backing vocals, horns, and harmonica to give the production a slinky groove until,   through, the song paused and became Long Time Gone, a Dixie Chicks song. The performance was followed by the announcement that a studio version of the collaboration was posted for free download on the Dixie Chicksâ€™ website.  The ominous theme of Daddy Lessons is rooted in traditional country. The song is sung from the perspective of a father giving his daughter advice from the grave. â€œHereâ€™s what you   trouble comes to   men like me come   my daddy said â€˜shootâ€™,â€ Maines sings on the new version. But the music sounds more comfortable dancing above a New Orleans street parade. The studio version, with its handclaps and percussive horns, replicates the   revelry of traditional brass bands in that city opposed to the more traditional   arrangements driving most country hits today. Beyonce at the CMAs is on the heels of last yearâ€™s surprise guest shot by Justin Timberlake, who performed a duet with Chris Stapleton that became a viral hit all year long. The   between country and pop stars is not unprecedented, as the country charts have become an unexpected refuge for many established outsiders from the pop and rock worlds, including Kid Rock and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.  One obvious reason for the crossover is greater exposure. Last week Nielsen released data that shows how country music is the top radio format in the US. In 2008, total country stations numbered 2, 874 today the stations number just over 4, 000. Country is also where the adults are. Country Music Association data shows country music is the number one format among adults  .

Analyzing offender data on roughly 1. 5 million US prisoners, researchers from the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that for one in four, drug treatment, community service, probation or a fine would have been a more effective sentence than incarceration. â€œThe current sentencing regime was largely a   reaction to crime, not grounded in any scientific rationale,â€ said Inimai Chettiar, director of the justice program. â€œWhile it may have seemed like a reasonable approach to protect the public, a comprehensive examination of the data proves it is ineffective at that task. â€ The study also concluded that another 14% of incarcerated individuals had already served an appropriate sentence. These people could be released within the next year â€œwith little risk to public safetyâ€ the researchers said. Combined, these two populations represent 39% of the current incarcerated public.  â€œVery long lengths of stay in many many cases do not make people safer,â€ said   Eisen, the lead author of the report. â€œIncarceration is not the right place for so many   offenders in our criminal justice system. â€œ The study drew on data from 2012 and took three years to complete. Researchers applied a   test on the effectiveness of incarceration, relative to the different types of crimes prisoners had committed. Seriousness of the crime, impact on the victim, state of mind of the perpetrator and risk of recidivism were all examined as part of the analysis. Researchers determined that for most   crimes, especially nonviolent drug crimes, prison was ineffective or unwarranted. â€œThere are so many groups trying to work to end mass incarceration but without a blueprint for exactly how you would do that, itâ€™s really hard to make changes,â€ Eisen said. â€œWe wanted this report to   a conversation. â€ Beyond the fact that many inmates do not pose an immediate threat to public safety, an abundance of evidence suggests that prison itself likely has a criminogenic effect on those who enter its walls. When people involved in   nonviolent crimes become incarcerated, they are often placed in an environment with more unstable and violent criminals they can become more prone to crime upon release than they would otherwise have been. Alternative sentencing strategies, including drug treatment and community service, have been shown in several studies to have the opposite effect. Incarceration also damages family, workplace and community ties in ways that often make it more difficult for people to avoid crime after release. Eisenâ€™s team also considered the way offenders tend to age out of criminal behavior. â€œThe research is incredibly compelling that after a certain age, itâ€™s very unlikely that a person would commit a second offense,â€ Eisen said. Last year, for instance, Marc Mauer, a researcher and the executive director of the Sentencing Project, testified to Congress: â€œA    robber is much less of a risk to public safety by the time he turns 30, 35, or 40, and this is true more or less across the board. â€ The Brennan Center calculates that this could equal a cost saving of $20bn a year, greater than the combined budgets of the US departments of commerce and labor. â€œOur resources are finite, and any opportunity we can have to realign those resources to find the truly dangerous people and put them behind bars, we should,â€ said Ronal Serpas, the former police chief of the New Orleans and Nashville departments. Serpas noted that a slew of law enforcement organizations, including the Major Cities Police Chiefs Association and the National District Attorneys Association, had all come together to endorse the scaling back of mass incarceration. The organizations encompass 30, 000 law enforcement professionals in all. A young policing leader during the crime wave of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Serpas said he understood why so many officials supported incarceration and draconian sentencing laws during that era. â€œI get it, I was there,â€ he said. â€œBut this is 20 years later,â€ Serpas added. â€œWe donâ€™t treat arthritis the same way we did 20 years ago, but unfortunately weâ€™re still   on incarceration the way we did back then. â€ ",702,394,"832330942169612289	832333549315379200	832334352759394304	832334358996344832	832337823399186433	832337824334491648	832354030022180867	832368067959279616	832368113844965377	832592619200995328	832596169666736128	832632411934429185	832645845615013888	832654479702908928	832663452623659010	832675802151923715	832675997988253696	832683161742028800	832683696113135617	832688066359918592	832688503154675712	832688581214822401	832697451471593472	832704384970534912	832706923929620481	832715858875121665	832721358480080896	832723965655207936	832737469451825156	832753553961725953	832758116601126912	832768149825032192	832768654815006722	832772712351178752	832799857400111104	832800309500006402	832802226858962944	832811011174432768	832829170405216256	832846322441019393	832937944692424704	832939821312139265	832952009691103233	832958074243674112	832958565539143680	832982072109195265	832998343043190787	832998576296960000	833025735266795520	833026874041249792	833069326387146753	833071046517473280	833102562060595200	833103707441082369	833120272953798664	833120590546493441	833120637795389444	833163934819573760	833185320887779328	833218604308914176	833241374602338304	833241669541646337	833275370463977473	833327174425964544	833330274549145600	833332257993678848	833353255929446401	833367828195602432	833396929149145088	833400856431128577	833404385480708097	833405695378804737	833405927327817728	833410287302737920	833420651318935561	833425216365789185	833427247696592901	833440426728288258	833444695976062976	833452127817175041	833459946469543936	833468443647021056	833468580884656128	833509426384416768	833531135632228353	833545457355759617	833546523300356100	833566994595131394	833567354550300673	833579636370063360	833676201281601536	833722388814532610	833745075867881477	833747398224703490	833763211665166336	833789505966587906	833790323738415104	833860921873354754	833937985443885061	834183682403532800	834313752564596736	834760915249668097	835507114365882369	835529498019921926	835857968461721600	836646512507629568",fake

Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judgeâ€™s   comedy about a genetically dumbed down America is now being celebrated as prophetic cult classic. Or as Etan Cohen, one of the screenwriters, tweeted in February: â€œI never expected #Idiocracy to become a documentary. â€ The film has a   fan in Shepard Fairey, the street artist who created the famous Hope poster in support of Barack Obamaâ€™s candidacy in 2008. When the film first came out, he says, and his wife Amanda noticed a correlation between Idiocracy and â€œthe real dumbing down of American media we were witnessing even 10 years agoâ€. Now, as part of a voter education movement he has called Make America Smart Again, Fairey has created limited edition   posters which he will sell on Sunday, timed to coincide with the second presidential debate. The Mondo screen printer poster (designed with one of the movieâ€™s most famous lines, â€œItâ€™s got electrolytesâ€ and MASAâ€™s tag line â€œWhat brains crave! â€) will be available for 72 hours, with all proceeds going to to the League of Women Voters. Why did the street artist set up MASA? â€œI think that many voters donâ€™t understand the issues in a way that is sophisticated enough for them to make good decisions,â€ Fairey told the Guardian. â€œThings are getting quite blurry. The   marathon to the bottom turned out to be a   sprint. â€ Idiocracy is set in a dystopian America where a toxic combination of stupidity and consumerism has destroyed the environment and intellectually stunted society. In an Austin   situation, Joe, an army librarian played by Luke Wilson, is selected for a human hibernation experiment in 2005 and is awakened during the Great Garbage Avalanche of 2505. He soon learns that he is the smartest person in America. But no one will listen to him because â€œhe talks like a fagâ€. The president (played by Terry Crews) is Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, a   Ultimate Smackdown champion and porn superstar. Firing off his assault rifle, he declares in his State of the Union address: â€œI know shitâ€™s bad right now, with all that starving bullshit, and the dust storms [but] I got a three point plan to fix everything!â€ Meanwhile the country is a wasteland with a nationwide famine brought on by widespread agricultural failure. Crops are hydrated with Brawndo, a   drink instead of water. â€œBrawndoâ€™s got what plants crave. Itâ€™s got electrolytes,â€ claims the secretary of state, the   line that inspired Fairey. The Brawndo corporation owns the FDA and the FCC and their slogan is accepted science. (Last week, one tweeter observed that â€œBut heâ€™s a successful businessmanâ€ is the 2016 equivalent to â€œItâ€™s got electrolytesâ€.) The parallels are all too clear, and have been pointed out online through    clips and mashups of the Camancho and Trumpâ€™s   bombast. Thereâ€™s even a â€œMovement to classify Idiocracy as documentaryâ€ with its own Facebook page.  On Tuesday night, while the   candidates debated, Alamo Drafthouse screened Idiocracy in 45 theaters to packed houses across the country. â€œIt is all right there, staring you in the face,â€ Tim League, the founder and CEO of the chain said. â€œWe are clearly awash in an â€˜Ow, my ballsâ€™ electorateâ€  â€”   a reference to the hit reality TV show within the movie, an assemblage of clips of men getting hit in the testicles. Last week, MASA held their own screening of Idiocracy. Fairey moderated a discussion with Judge (who also   HBOâ€™s Silicon Valley) Crews and Dax Shepard, who plays Frito, Joeâ€™s   lawyer. â€œI love the way humor is used in Idiocracy to make the social critique more digestible,â€ Fairey says. â€œThe movie is a harsh but necessary indictment of the   culture and politics that seem to become the norm more and more every day. â€ The artist says that the filmâ€™s irony is that itâ€™s â€œa somewhat lowbrow piece of entertainment about the perils of succumbing to a cultural rejection of anything intellectual or highbrow. In other words, the genius of the film is that it may actually get through to the audience it should reach, rather than just preaching to the intellectual elite. â€ Asked how Make America Smart Again can promote Idiocracy as cautionary tale if it is a   group, Fairley said, â€œMASA is   and   which one could argue is partisan in this election because of Trumpâ€™s behavior. But letâ€™s face it, members of both parties have lied and appealed to the lowest common denominator. The point is that as voters we need to demand better from all the parties and all the candidates.

politifact14306,https://web.archive.org/web/20170806200608/https://world-politicus.com/2017/07/08/obama-goes-g20-summit/,Obama Goes To G20 Summit,"France votes this weekend to choose the rightwing candidate likely to face the   Marine Le Pen in next springâ€™s presidential election  â€”   just as Donald Trumpâ€™s US win has thrown the spotlight on France as the scene of the next possible shakeup of the political system. Polls have consistently shown that Le Pen, head of the   Front National, will make it to the French presidential     next May, but that it would be difficult for her to win. The three leading contenders in the open primary race to choose the rightâ€™s candidate on Sunday are all establishment figures  â€”   two former prime ministers, Alain JuppÃ© and FranÃ§ois Fillon, and the former president Nicolas Sarkozy.  For weeks they have been fighting over who could better unite French voters against the   in a country still struggling with mass unemployment and a major terrorism threat. JuppÃ©, 71, the mayor of Bordeaux who served as prime minister under Jacques Chirac in 1995, is Franceâ€™s most popular politician and has for months been the favourite. He has led a centrist campaign pledging   reform but also promoting social harmony against   identity politics, vowing: â€œI wonâ€™t turn people in France against each otherâ€. JuppÃ© has undergone a staggering image transformation since the 1990s, when he was the most loathed French prime minister in modern times and 2 million people took to the streets in protest against his pension changes. In 2004 he received a   suspended sentence and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt 1980s scheme that illegally put workers for Jacques Chiracâ€™s party on the payroll of the Paris town hall. Although it is accepted that he did not profit personally and was seen as having taken the flak for Chirac, the case could come back to haunt him during a fierce presidential campaign.  Since Trumpâ€™s election, critics have warned he would seem too   establishment against Le Pen, with echoes of the US campaign. â€œI am not Hillary Clinton, and France is not America,â€ he said this week, insisting he could be trusted to take swift action on major reform. Sarkozyâ€™s bid for a political comeback is seen as his last chance in French politics. He has led a hardline campaign on identity politics, targeting Muslims and minorities, denying climate change and unashamedly veering into Le Penâ€™s   territory.  Sarkozy remains a divisive figure in France but he has loyal core support in his Les RÃ©publicains party, which is expected to turn out massively to vote. He wants to ban the Muslim headscarf from universities and public companies, limit the French nationality rights of children born of foreign parents and has insisted that children who donâ€™t eat pork should lose their special school dinner options and instead eat chips.  Although he supported Clinton in the US election, since Trumpâ€™s win he has styled himself as   and has promised to go against all that is â€œpolitically correctâ€. His campaign has been hampered by legal woes  â€”   including when the French state prosecutor recommended he should face a criminal trial over alleged illegal campaign funding.  In the final campaign debate on Thursday night, Sarkozy was quizzed about fresh claims that he received millions in funding from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi towards his 2007 campaign. Sarkozy had no answer and, losing his cool, said the question was â€œdisgracefulâ€. FranÃ§ois Fillon, Sarkozyâ€™s former prime minister, has gained in the polls in recent days to become a serious challenger. A devoted admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Fillon has the boldest project for economic reform  â€”   vowing to cut 500, 000 public sector jobs in the next five years.  A Paris MP, he is also a symbol of the provincial French right. A Catholic from a village in   France where he lived with his Welsh wife and their five children, he voted against   marriage when it was introduced by the current Socialist government and surged in the polls after publishing a book on the fight against radical Islam, saying: â€œNo, there isnâ€™t a religious problem in France. Yes, there is a problem linked to Islam. â€ He said the solution was not to target   Muslims, but to target fundamentalism. The candidatesâ€™ economic programmes are, however, similar: lowering public spending, curbing the   week, scrapping Franceâ€™s wealth tax, cutting state jobs and overhauling welfare.  The younger political generation has so far failed to take the lead in the primary race: the two youngest candidates, former ministers Nathalie   43, and Bruno Le Maire, 47, arenâ€™t expected to reach the final  .  The deep unpopularity of Socialist president FranÃ§ois Hollande and his fractured party means the French left are not currently predicted to make it to the final round of the presidential elections next May. The rightâ€™s primary vote is open to any voter who signs a charter saying they agree with the â€œRepublican values of the centre and the rightâ€ and pays â‚¬2. About 3. 5 million people are expected to turn out, including some leftwingers. â€œTwo euros seems cheap to have a say in keeping out Sarkozy,â€ said one leftwing publisher. FranÃ§ois   head of Viavoice pollsters, said there was major interest in the primary in part â€œbecause weâ€™re in a period where people are looking for solutions and want a quick transformation to get France out of its rut. Sarkozyâ€™s presidency was seen as disappointing, Hollandeâ€™s has been seen as insufficient. So thereâ€™s a big interest in who tomorrowâ€™s candidate would be. â€ The first round in the rightâ€™s primary race takes place on 20 November and the     on 27 November.  Alain JuppÃ©, 71, is the moderate,   mayor of Bordeaux and former prime minister under Jacques Chirac. Once nicknamed â€œAmstradâ€ for his robotic efficiency and cold, grey image, he is now Franceâ€™s favourite politician. Nicolas Sarkozy, 61, is leader of the rightâ€™s Les RÃ©publicains party. He was French president from 2007 to 2012. His   views on immigration, identity and security have won support from a loyal rightwing core but made him a hate figure on the left. FranÃ§ois Fillon, 62, was Sarkozyâ€™s prime minister, but has since questioned Sarkozyâ€™s style and policies. As prime minister, he warned France was facing bankruptcy and is running on a   reform agenda, promising to tackle economic woes. Bruno Le Maire, 47, was an agriculture minister during Sarkozyâ€™s presidency. The Normandy MP styled himself as the candidate for â€œrenewalâ€ but struggled to shake off an image as an   technocrat. Nathalie   43, was a popular ecology minister under Sarkozy. She was sacked as   of Sarkozyâ€™s Les RÃ©publicains party in December 2015 after she criticised his leadership. She is the only woman in the contest.",570,989,"1436642283	1436642464	1436643954	1437071990	1437072188	1437073277	1437275013	1437275119	1437275704	1446884155	1695137525	17041113354	17355717301	2964692586729472	3004631802183681	132235170257440768	132847692878594049	368126996796424192	368129129280835584	373518574452604928	375851803536936960	531791526137851904	533407989114601472	536800277849190400	595433648658247680	595434989216399361	661968960791953413	665373242018803713	666306522578833416	668883831433334784	880801624461115392	883528732903976960	883561993298432000	883693111398064129	883725040491139076	883755440391077888	883807090061344768	883837617619570688	883876142217924608	884048992069398528	884156468978569216	885162732525199360	885164293305491456	885320862815014912	896242284676751360	1007473611370893313",fake
politifact15049,http://yournewswire.com/melanic-trump-exorcist-white-house/,Melania Trump Hired Exorcist To ‘Cleanse White House Of Obama Demons’,"An Illinois congressman who resigned amid scrutiny of his lavish spending  â€”   including a Downton   redecoration of his Capitol Hill office  â€”   has been charged in a   federal indictment that alleges he conspired to profit personally from his government job. The   indictment accuses Aaron Schock, a   Republican star, of brazen efforts to make money, such as buying World Series tickets with campaign funds and reselling them at a profit. When Schock risked missing a connecting flight for a European holiday, the indictment alleges, he paid a private aircraft company more than $8, 000 (Â£6, 300) out of his campaign account to fly him from Peoria to Washington. Schock spent $40, 000 in government funds to redecorate his Washington office, including $5, 000 on a chandelier, and asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30, 000 of camera equipment, prosecutors allege. The indictment says he incurred a $140, 000 mileage bill over six years, reimbursements for 150, 000 more miles than his vehicles actually travelled. The    from Peoria is charged in the   indictment with nine counts of wire fraud, five of falsification of election commission filings, six of filing false federal income tax returns, two of making false statements and one each of mail fraud and theft of government funds. A conviction on just one count of wire fraud alone carries a maximum   prison sentence. He is scheduled to apper in court on 21 November. â€œMr Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offences, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds,â€ the US attorney in Springfield, Jim Lewis, said in a statement announcing the indictment. After the charges were announced, Schockâ€™s lawyer, George Terwilliger, said many of the issues in the indictment were administrative ones that many members of Congress grapple with. â€œItâ€™s baffling to me that the government would think that itâ€™s a proper exercise of discretion to make criminal mountains out of these molehill issues,â€ he said. â€œIt was evident to us from the first day they subpoenaed him that they had every intent to embarrass and humiliate him. â€ Terwilliger said in an earlier statement that â€œthese charges are the culmination of an effort to find something, anything, to take down Aaron Schockâ€. Schock, who was a prodigious fundraiser for the GOP, resigned in March 2015 amid intensifying scrutiny over real estate deals, extensive travel that he documented on his social media accounts and other spending documented by Associated Press and other media outlets. The reports raised questions about improper mileage reimbursements, trips on donorsâ€™ aircraft and more. The former congressman downplayed the allegations in June, saying any wrongdoing was â€œhonest mistakesâ€. In his statement on Thursday, Schock said he never intentionally did anything wrong and that he was eager to defend his name and reputation. â€œAs I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes  â€”   no one intended to break any law,â€ he said. The charges were the culmination of a   investigation that included two grand juries that Schock said â€œpoked, prodded, and probed every aspect of my professional, political, and personal lifeâ€. â€œLike many Americans, I wanted to have faith in the integrity of our Justice Department,â€ he said. â€œBut after this experience, I am forced to join millions of other Americans who have sadly concluded that our federal justice system is broken and too often driven by politics instead of facts. â€ In 2014, Schock bought four Super Bowl tickets for $10, 025 paid for by one of his campaign funds, according to court documents. He then resold the tickets at a $1, 975 profit and never reimbursed his campaign for the initial purchase price. Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now a   managing director of investigations at Berkeley Research Group, said some of Schockâ€™s alleged schemes were bold and elaborate but resulted in relatively petty payouts compared to other   corruption cases that have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars. â€œItâ€™s greed but on a comparatively small scale  â€”   for Illinois,â€ Cramer said. Schockâ€™s attorney said he was confident any future jurors would acquit Schock and would also be â€œdisgusted with what their own government has doneâ€. If Schock is ultimately convicted, he could join an already lengthy list of Illinois politicians who ended up in prison in recent years. Former US representative Jesse Jackson Jr was convicted for spending $750, 000 in campaign money on fur capes, mounted elk heads, Hollywood memorabilia and other personal items. Two of the stateâ€™s recent governors, Republican George Ryan and Democrat Rod Blagojevich, were convicted of   corruption. And former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was convicted in a   case.",750,548,"961718890081513473	961743614928879616	961747237452660736	961751977813336065	961791640980439040	961803988789178370	961814042728792064	961816064890880000	961820961535287298	961828185309507586	961832412123549696	961833091034529792	961833285042061313	961833722357010432	961834151530790912	961864579520212992	961877066705784833	961881880563015680	961881885218689024	961881889199058944	961881886946623488	961881892520775680	961881891862433792	961881891132461056	961881896216154112	961881894714519552	961942000365813761	961946065518907392	961968647911518208	961986350672211968	961987365685297153	961990137050816512	962000159600078848	962011138220158976	962035325924139009	962050107909681153	962072643435356161	962079046241738752	962094195489017858	962108866954715136	962119408754872322	962119480909418496	962125720087654402	962150392514646017	962175724957429760	962217820154138624	962235725407191040	962245746690011136	962251264913485826	962435071209713664	962491294839959553	962617111221645313	962688003511607296	962697149048901632	962714337679937536	962714353534427138	962834972854845440	962834979762921472	963061357917757440	963648333410693121	963768844941774848	964482169677713409	964615251130957824	965224853455364097	965303284117450752	965616474680446976	965809777614905344	966728613860175872	975479199115902977	975862138978811904",fake
politifact13744,actionnetwork.org/petitions/urgent-new-law-would-charge-protesters-with-terrorism/,URGENT: proposed law would charge protesters with terrorism,"â€œDo you remember me?â€ she asks, as a hopeful smile spreads on her face, like sheâ€™s trying to tease the right answer out of me. Weâ€™re not children any more. Weâ€™ve left. Some of us left with our families, some with our friends and some alone. Now weâ€™re living in this other world where we keep having to explain  â€”   why we lived in so many countries, why our accents change when we talk to strangers, why we didnâ€™t go to school, why we canâ€™t sleep. But to one another, to those of us who grew up like me in the Family, we donâ€™t have to explain. Yet on message boards, on Facebook, and now, outside a coffee shop on South Congress in Austin, Texas, this same question  â€”   â€œDo you remember me?â€  â€”   comes up over and over. Itâ€™s usually followed by the volley of questions weâ€™ve tested to figure out who we were then. â€œWhat was your name? Who were your parents? Were you in Osaka? Switzerland?â€ Part of the problem with growing up in something so secluded as a cult is that our pasts are so unbelievable we need a witness for our own memory. And so we seek out those who remember. When I met Ruthie, I was crossing the country in a tiny Winnebago because this is the sort of brilliant idea you get when you canâ€™t sleep. My trip stalled in Austin with a broken clutch, so I sent out a message on a board for cult babies: â€œAnyone here?â€ Ruthie responded and I invited her for coffee. I didnâ€™t need to figure out who this woman was, I knew. She was a frazzled German with an American accent who clutched her coffee, her fingers worn ragged. Those calluses and scars were a   of what our parents would call   but whose curriculum was heavy on   cooking and the words of our prophet. With its lack of anything that might be considered a real education, some of us have difficulty finding work that doesnâ€™t make our hands bleed. We were 13 the last time Ruthie and I saw each other. Her name was Faithy back then and I wasnâ€™t allowed to talk to her. In fact, I wasnâ€™t allowed to talk to anyone, because the last time I saw her we were both still in the Family and we were in serious trouble. We lived in a huge,   chalet in Switzerland which had once been a quaint bed and breakfast. If it werenâ€™t for the Familyâ€™s avoidance of even basic upkeep, it would have been like something youâ€™d see on a postcard. Our window boxes were filled with rotting memories of carnations, the roof leaked and the floors sagged under the weight of all the people they supported. Weâ€™d managed to cram nearly 70 of us into this particular home. Its one virtue was that it was close enough to the American military bases in Germany that we could pick up Armed Forces Radio. That was important, because I had a radio. One night, a home shepherd called Auntie Mercy shook my shoulder to wake me. My first thought was that the Romans were at the door. Romans were cops and we practised constantly for when they made their inevitable raid on our home. As Auntie Mercy put a finger to her lips to shush me, I looked around and saw that the other kids were still asleep. This was not a good sign. I followed her out on to the landing in my undershirt and panties because when a home shepherd summons you, you donâ€™t stop to get dressed. She didnâ€™t say a word, only turned, and I followed her down the stairs. The other home shepherds were in the dining room along with the shepherd for my age group, Uncle Stephan, who waved his weirdly hairless arm at me and said: â€œHave a seat, sweetie. â€ When a word like sweetie, so innocent and saccharine, slips out of the wrong mouth, youâ€™ll wish you were wearing pants. I sat in the chair facing them, and rubbed my eyes, acting sleepy to buy time, like staring down a gun and pleading for a cigarette. â€œShould we pray?â€ asked Auntie Mercy. We held hands, mine clammy, and we prayed as I flicked a hardened, yellow grain of overboiled rice with my toe. The eels began to turn in my stomach as I waited for the inevitable next line. â€œDo you have anything to tell us?â€ I started small with the confessions. Iâ€™d played this game before. â€œI havenâ€™t been putting my heart into my chores,â€ I said. If I got it right on the first guess, theyâ€™d just keep digging for more. I would give them anything. I would have to. But I wasnâ€™t giving up my radio. One thing most cults have in common is that you have to give up everything to join. In that home, and every other home Iâ€™d lived in, there was a pile somewhere of random items someone had given up to follow Jesus. If Grandma or Aunt Nancy sends you a package, that goes in the pile too. Occasionally, all this crap is divvied out to those who need the supplies, or those with enough pull to get something they want. When I had been tasked to clean up the pile, I found the radio. Faithy caught me listening the first night. She slept below me, in the middle bunk of the  . I was up top. Wherever we went, the bunks were built out of    and plywood. The mattresses were bare foam, but werenâ€™t too bad. The foam was easy to cut into if you wanted to hide something  â€”     eggs, a book, a corner of a chocolate bar, or even a radio. Faithy and I hadnâ€™t talked much because I had been on silence restriction and not allowed to speak to anyone but a shepherd. Silence restriction and   were the newest tactics in arbitrarily inflicted punishment. Silence restriction is pretty simple to understand. Then we wore signs around our necks made of cardboard or plywood with catchy slogans like â€œSilence restrictionâ€ or â€œI need to count my blessingsâ€ or â€œPlease remind me to smileâ€  â€”   that last was being worn by an    whose desire to smile remained unchanged. Punishments came and went like any other fad in the outside world but favourite methods included writing essays, memorising chapters of the Bible, a   daisy chain wrapped around your head and then hooked to each cheek to force a smile, running laps around a driveway, pointless manual labour, isolation, public beatings,    diets. These, usually in some combination, could last days or months and there was no way to tell which way it would go. Faithy was new to our home, louder than the rest of us had learned to be, and she had more than one pair of socks, a sign sheâ€™d been living in smaller homes where kids get things like socks. I met her the night I accidentally pulled out the headphone cord from the radio and she heard the static from the little   speaker. From that night on, when we were pretty sure no one else would check on us, sheâ€™d climb into my bunk. I snapped the plastic band attaching the earpieces, weâ€™d each take one and huddle together under my blanket to listen. Since it was my radio, I got to choose between our only two English music stations. And for a few hours each night, we experienced a whole new world. The Family produced their own music but their songs werenâ€™t about love or loss or pain. Family songs praised Jesus, or our prophet, or the Family itself. The radio brought music and words that made us feel hope and loss. I could live another life in the radioâ€™s music, another life where I wasnâ€™t so afraid of everyone. Sometimes weâ€™d hear the Cure or the Smiths. I loved the   painful voices I didnâ€™t understand but felt pouring into me. Faithy wasnâ€™t as enthralled. She liked Cyndi Lauper and Michael Jackson. Weâ€™d tap our toes against the footboard until we remembered that we werenâ€™t alone, and stopped for fear of waking up the kid in the bottom bunk. Our secret created a bond and we started talking during the day. We talked about places weâ€™d been and told stories from before, when the cult had been just hippies, travelling in caravans and living in camp grounds, and we remembered being happy. There wasnâ€™t much else to talk about. She saw and did everything I saw and did. She was good at remembering movies and as sheâ€™d lived in some of the more liberal homes, sheâ€™d seen more than I had. Sheâ€™d tell me the movies, scene by scene and sometimes line by line, like they were stories. I hadnâ€™t made many friends, or at least didnâ€™t keep them. I was in trouble a lot and few of the children around me were stupid or brave enough to be friends with someone on the shepherdsâ€™ radar. Friends in the Family were a liability, but now I had a friend, or something close to it, and I liked having someone to talk to. Then a few weeks into our nightly listening party, Auntie Mercy caught Faithy in my bed. Weâ€™d accidentally fallen asleep. Auntie Mercy didnâ€™t see the radio, but she told us sheâ€™d better not catch us again. When she didnâ€™t say anything to us the next day, we thought sheâ€™d let the infraction slide. If she had, it would have been the first and last time sheâ€™d shown anyone mercy. I didnâ€™t know her well enough yet to fear her as I should have. â€œWhat else?â€ asked Uncle Stephan. His eyes were cold and blue and he had this German accent, which was perfect, really. I had tried to avoid him, but avoiding him was impossible. I hadnâ€™t seen any Nazi movies or I might have known that he fitted the mould, like a caricature. His eyes terrified me. Despite only wearing a thin undershirt, I wasnâ€™t cold. Still, I folded my arms over my chest and shivered. â€œI was foolish. I told some jokes I know,â€ I said. â€œWhat else?â€ After the first hour, I ran out of things to confess. I was tired and confused. I stopped talking. I didnâ€™t know what they wanted. I closed my eyes and I was quiet when I heard his boots on the tiled floor. Uncle Stephan always wore boots in the house. No one else ever did. Grandpa didnâ€™t like wearing shoes indoors because shoes dragged filth inside and evil spirits could hitchhike on shoes and clothing. Grandpa was David Berg, the founder of the Family. The adults called him Dad, which was as confusing as it sounds. In another reality, another time, heâ€™d have been locked up in an institution. In my reality and time, he founded a cult. I felt Uncle Stephanâ€™s breath on my face for a moment. Then he slapped me hard across the face. I heard the shepherds praying for me again, or maybe they were praying against me. I felt my lip with my tongue and tasted blood. I didnâ€™t know where my parents were or if they knew what was happening. I didnâ€™t dare ask. I opened my eyes and met his across from me. I hated him. Uncle Stephan had already put me on silence restriction for a month. Iâ€™d only recently been allowed to talk again. We hadnâ€™t seen a movie all year because we werenâ€™t â€œfollowing the spiritâ€. Itâ€™s not like we ever watched anything but musicals anyway, but those were better than the nothing we had now. He liked public punishments. And he used a bamboo cane he carried around with him. Spanking wasnâ€™t anything unusual, but his cane, which broke skin, only happened behind closed doors. Most of the time they just used a belt or a paddle. So I stared at his eyes and I didnâ€™t blink and I wanted him to see I wasnâ€™t crying. I knew heâ€™d break me. They hadnâ€™t broken me yet but it was inevitable. All I wanted in that moment was for Uncle Stephan to know that breaking me wouldnâ€™t be easy. I looked above Uncle Stephanâ€™s head and saw a poster of Jesus. This wasnâ€™t the blond, friendly Jesus. This Jesus was coming down from heaven on a horse, surrounded by the flames of a burning Earth. If the shepherds had watched any cop shows before they dropped out to follow Jesus, they would have known the proper way to do an interrogation. While I sat in the dining room and tried to figure out what the shepherds wanted from me, Faithy was in the shepherdsâ€™ office upstairs and probably wondering the same thing. They didnâ€™t know they were supposed to tell me Faithy was upstairs and I should tell them everything before she cut a deal. But then again, there were no deals in the Family. Confession, while possibly good for the soul, was not good for my immediate future. I couldnâ€™t think of any more small crimes. So I just started making shit up. â€œI took some apricots from the pantry. â€ â€œWhy?â€ â€œI was hungry and there were lots so I thought it was OK. â€ â€œWhat else?â€ â€œI murmured about having to watch the kids instead of going postering last Saturday. â€ That was a lie, but a lie that might work in my favour. I liked taking care of the little kids. Plus, my mom was in charge of them so being assigned to help with the little kids meant spending the day with her while most of the home was out raising money by selling posters or knocking on doors and asking for donations. â€œWhat else?â€ Six hours later, the sun was up and I could hear the home stirring upstairs. The kids assigned to make breakfast walked around the circle of shepherds and me. The kids looked straight ahead as they passed. There was a time when I might have felt humiliated. But we were used to public punishments now so I didnâ€™t mind them seeing me. Weâ€™d all been in this chair at some point. Those who hadnâ€™t knew it was only a matter of time. The shepherds either had what they wanted from me or gave up trying. Auntie Mercy wanted to pray again. This time I had to hold their hands and the words she prayed told me this was just the beginning of my ordeal. A few weeks later, still in the attic where theyâ€™d decided to store problem kids like me, where weâ€™d read the insane ramblings of our drunken prophet, where they expected us to report every thought that passed through our heads, where the beatings happened daily, I broke. It sounds more like a sigh than the shattering you feel in your soul. I remembered how it didnâ€™t hurt when I broke, how it was easier after. The Romans came that night. But they were too late. Someone tipped off a reporter at the local newspaper, who tipped off the home shepherds. Before the sun rose, we quietly crammed ourselves into vans, kept our heads below the windows, and our shepherds drove us to the next home. Faithy didnâ€™t come to the new home and I knew better than to ask where sheâ€™d gone. And now, this woman named Ruthie, with Faithyâ€™s face and voice, was asking me about the radio. â€œDid they ever find it?â€ â€œYou didnâ€™t rat me out,â€ I say. No, they never found the radio. â€œBut then why did you get in so much more trouble than I did?â€ she asks. â€œI wondered about that for years. But you know how it goes, you just stop thinking about it. Then one day, I was telling my girlfriend about the radio and I finally figured it out. They thought I was gay. â€ â€œGoddammit,â€ she says, smacking the table. The pearl   Austinites stop to stare at the interruption of their peace. We both smile at the three Family sins sheâ€™s just committed  â€”   drawing attention, unwomanly loudness, and the greatest and least forgivable, taking the Lordâ€™s name in vain. â€œHow much did that suck?â€ I laugh and shake my head and say: â€œFuckers. â€ This is the shorthand we speak because she knows, without me having to tell her, how hard it was to give them that one thing. To know they were right, even if only once. But at 13, I wasnâ€™t yet a lesbian, or anyway I didnâ€™t know it. Back then I was just an awkward tomboy. She shows me pictures of her husband, her kids. I show her pictures of my dog. We talk all afternoon. She says sheâ€™s doing all right. Maybe weâ€™re both grading on a curve, but I tell her I am too. And we donâ€™t have to explain. We remember.

Hough, 39, was born in West Berlin and brought up in the Family, founded by David Berg in 1968 in California and originally known as the Children of God.  Where do you live now? In Austin, Texas. Iâ€™ve only been here a couple of months. I sold my house in Washington DC last year and Iâ€™ve been travelling in my camper. A couple of months in Portland, Oregon and Berlin and now Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™ve enjoyed it tremendously, but Iâ€™ve rented a house in Santa Fe and Iâ€™m moving there in a couple of weeks. You moved around a lot with the Family? We travelled around in campers, caravans, lived in tents. We moved to Chile for a couple of years when I was four. Japan for a few years too, then Switzerland and then Germany. It must have been quite something when you left. Oh God, yes. I was done. I just couldnâ€™t figure out how to leave on my own. I would think about it  â€¦     do I run to the embassy? How can I get my passport? Then one day Mom just told us to pack. There was absolute relief and absolute terror  â€”   we stayed in Munich for a couple of weeks and my brother and I were convinced we were going back in. But we didnâ€™t. My grandmother took us into her little house in west Texas. What made your mother decide to leave? Mom was worried that weâ€™d had absolutely no education and that she couldnâ€™t protect me. My stepdad was just frustrated that they were never going to make him a leader. Why did your parents join the Family? My mom was upset about the Vietnam war. She was a hippy, protesting and everything else, and here were people who were actually doing something  â€”   dropping out, leaving society, following Jesus. The way she saw it was, yeah, a great, utopian thing. She met my father and he was there for much the same reason. He was travelling around so he wouldnâ€™t get a draft card. My mom doesnâ€™t talk about the Family and I donâ€™t ask her about it. Weâ€™re close, but only so much. I only recently talked to my dad about it [Houghâ€™s parents split up when she was 7]. Weâ€™re close now. We werenâ€™t always. You donâ€™t blame them for what happened? Well, I know what an idiot I was when I was 19, the age they were when they joined. Itâ€™s kinda hard to hold it against someone. How have you felt since coming out? Have you had a lot of therapy? Not so much and most of it wasnâ€™t so helpful. Iâ€™ve had therapists cry and hug me and it was really strange. They just donâ€™t really know what to do with it. I mean, I still hide things. I still have nightmares, I canâ€™t deal with crowds. I will always feel kind of separate. For a long time, I just didnâ€™t really have friends. In high school, I had no idea how to talk to people. I didnâ€™t understand cultural references. Ninety per cent of conversations are: â€œHey, do you remember that episode of Seinfeld?â€ and shit. And I was weird, I was just awkward. I read everything I could get my hands on. Itâ€™s just what I did, I hid in books. Which books particularly? On the Road: the book that made me want to write. The Liarsâ€™ Club by Mary Karr. The Glass Castle [by Jeannette Walls]  â€”   reading this, I realised you could take a terrible thing, that bad thing in every memoir, and make it worth reading. Thereâ€™s no   in it. Do you know what has become of the   â€œShepherdsâ€? Oh, God  â€¦     thank God, no. â€œUncle Stephanâ€  â€”   the last anyone saw he was holding a cardboard â€œThe End Is Nearâ€ sign in Amsterdam. I mean, some of these people are my friendsâ€™ parents. Weâ€™ve all reconnected through Facebook. But  â€¦     I stay away from the subject of whose parents did what to whom and I will meet them but not their parents. Thereâ€™s a very clear line drawn between who we associate with.   people versus the people who joined. We have our secret Facebook groups where we can talk. We kind of provide our own free therapy. Whatâ€™s next? Iâ€™d like to write more. I donâ€™t know if I can support myself doing this but Iâ€™m working on a book  â€”   a memoir trying to put it all together.

In a description of the call, the White House said Biden and the king spoke of â€œrecent negative developments in Bahrain and their implications for the wider regionâ€. On Thursday, an explosion south of the Bahraini capital, Manama, killed a woman and injured her three children. A day later, police said the blast was a â€œterrorist bombingâ€ in the village of Eker and said officers had begun an investigation. Violence has increased in Bahrain as the Sunni monarchy has cracked down on dissent among factions of the majority Shia population. Recent bombings have been blamed on radical Shia opposition groups, which were largely driven underground after failed protests in 2011.  About 1, 200 troops from Saudi Arabia and 800 from the United Arab Emirates helped quash that uprising, which threatened to upend Bahrain as an Egyptian revolt had overthrown its government a month before. In recent months, the Bahraini government has stripped away the citizenship of 250 people, including the countryâ€™s most prominent Shia cleric suspended the largest Shia opposition group and extended a prison term for its leader kept activists out of a United Nations human rights meeting and rearrested a human rights activist for spreading â€œfalse newsâ€. The UN secretary general, Ban   and his rights chief have called on Bahrain to respect human rights. The US relies on Bahrain to house the navyâ€™s fifth fleet. After a brief ban on military aid in 2011, it resumed selling ammunition, helicopters and military equipment to the kingdom.  Earlier this week, a group of senators, prompted by a state department report that found Bahrain had failed to enact reforms, urged Barack Obama to rethink the US arms deal with the kingdom. In a letter to the secretary of state, John Kerry, the senators wrote: â€œBahrainâ€™s failure to address the legitimate grievances of its citizens has strained the countryâ€™s social fabric and invited outside actors to take advantage of the deteriorating situation. â€ Lawmakers including the Democratic Oregon senator Ron Wyden introduced a bill to ban sales of weapons and riot control equipment to Bahrain until the country launches reforms, such as integrating its â€œ â€ security forces, commuting the sentences of political prisoners and ending all sanctioned and unsanctioned torture. That political crisis â€œcould quickly intensify and destabilize an important United States allyâ€ the senators warned. â€œIndeed, we believe the governmentâ€™s harsh crackdown on the political opposition undermines the countryâ€™s stability and plays into the hands of Iran. â€ While the 2011 uprisings were bolstered by   sentiment around the Middle East, more recent protests and crackdowns have taken sectarian tinges. Bahrain is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni presence of the Middle East, and at odds with the dominant Shia force, Iran.  In June, one of Iranâ€™s most powerful generals warned that Bahrainâ€™s crackdown could â€œset the region on fireâ€. On Thursday, a state department spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters the Obama administration remained concerned about how the weapons it sells will be used. â€œWe continue to urge the government of Bahrain to reverse their recent harmful actions,â€ he said. According to the White House, Biden made similar entreaties. â€œThe Vice President emphasized the importance of reducing ongoing tensions through dialogue and reconciliation with the opposition, and a commitment to reform,â€ its statement said.",239,148,"958562266458312704	958562304727150592	958563269962117122	958563777372356608	958564031559737344	958564045740638208	958564046483095553	958564059716059136	958565383430197248	958565548203192320	958565736728989698	958565747546120193	958572022577147905	958574179737010176	958574514106925056	958574770395729921	958577147861458944	958577921295306752	958578862388076544	958579473728921605	958580395162963968	958580425315758080	958581116163813377	958582228010913792	958585252083130369	958587832729243648	958590562889846784	958591569938075648	958594150282223616	958595088371810304	958596334726107137	958597173767176192	958599850517565440	958608322944536576	958608469619363840	958608610703167489	958610978953887744	958612389020266496	958612575419166720	958614179384123392	958625488796299264	958626378357837824	958631590862774272	958631933528936449	958633062392360960	958634160163315712	958636885328441345	958637256985796608	958639887732953088	958640021929541632	958641976626368513	958642676248842240	958643064284704768	958645999639003136	958652597937811457	958656028685594624	958659486432014336	958660470843457538	958660559725060096	958660794987765760	958662143355883521	958666712836026368	958667275619348486	958667826373435392	958669800267493376	958672934058561538	958673098831810560	958673153747664896	958673978293473280	958677242615394304	958677858569814016	958678284744777728	958678658692059137	958680503510491137	958682879780728832	958683449853804544	958685238217138177	958686958032650241	958687881505247232	958687893811269632	958689885199708161	958690608977244160	958691006408527872	958691802609078273	958693915489599488	958693925203644417	958694973704196098	958696867243741184	958698646068965379	958698842773426176	958700679668776960	958701433947385858	958701975922671617	958704862442778625	958704914162769920	958705591177875457	958706047841005568	958709010953273346	958709793992032257	958710251565457413	958710418926522374	958711877676154880	958714725587496960	958717132409159681	958718491070271490	958720489165291521	958724918769840134	958724989024456704	958725980285292546	958727190195195904	958728218466451457	958730025859276801	958731037911138304	958733708214890498	958733946002518016	958734482068180992	958736557892096000	958737182008774656	958737858327646211	958737919438721024	958738514232991744	958739029675012096	958740193976168448	958744060788953089	958744185791660032	958745053798772739	958747053600931840	958748719951892487	958748793696026626	958750600472219649	958751411524833280	958754737951789061	958755075895291904	958755250277572608	958756126689959936	958760351822221312	958762746941616128	958763209867059201	958763380772401152	958766238582345729	958770025464258560	958770200576516096	958770322077077512	958770723832696837	958771895637340160	958772782275448834	958775530228273158	958776339951169536	958777467258404865	958779865964085248	958780180352458753	958801586456801287	958801749178957824	958818786332893184	958820986324795394	958822241084551169	958826413762777088	958829845420617729	958829959686041600	958841627036053504	958841902022975488	958867642651238401	958877183489069056	958888969344880640	958890952416026625	958912560224387072	958949354991247360	958987108349366277	958997876545392641	958998898982506497	959046729839661058	959053382127267840	959056848908406784	959074377248645122	959113662991683585	959113986657652742	959123655610466304	959138201460813824	959215408661385216	959499822498795521	1046182858707136514",fake
politifact15626,http://maga2020.us/news/clint-eastwood-leaves-his-estate-to-the-trump-2020-campaign/,Clint Eastwood Leaves His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign,"Novak Djokovic lost his temper and then his   at the Shanghai Masters to Spainâ€™s Roberto Bautista Agut     on Saturday. The   Serb struggled to control his errors for the second straight match, spraying groundstrokes and missing routine drop shots. He finished with 29 unforced errors and was a miserable    on   chances. Djokovic couldnâ€™t control his emotions, either: he smashed his racket into bits after losing the first set later grabbing a towel from a ball girl to sweep up the pieces himself and ripped his shirt open in anger during another point. He also argued repeatedly with the chair umpire Carlos Bernardes over line calls and a time violation he received for changing his ripped shirt. He continued the exchange even after the match, and complained in his   news conference. â€œ(Bernardes) was the star of the show,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s what he wanted to be today. â€ Djokovic has talked repeatedly this week about trying to find calm on the court and rediscover his inner joy for the game after a gruelling couple of years that has left him mentally exhausted. During his   he even started humming to keep his anger from boiling over. There were no songs on Saturday. Just frustration. â€œThis is one of those days,â€ Djokovic said. â€œThings go in an opposite direction than you want them, but again, itâ€™s a lesson. Every day is a lesson. â€ Itâ€™s been a season full of them for a player not accustomed to struggling: a stunning loss to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon, an early exit at the Rio Olympics to Juan MartÃ­n del Potro, a demoralising defeat in the US Open final to Stan Wawrinka. There have also been injuries, yet another unfamiliar issue for the normally healthy Djokovic. But the Serb doesnâ€™t believe these challenges are insurmountable. Or that theyâ€™ll lead to a deeper slide. â€œI had to experience sooner or later this,â€ he said. â€œI knew I could not go on playing the highest level for so many years all the time, but itâ€™s good to experience this so I can hopefully get better in the period to come. â€ Bautista Agut won his first match against Djokovic in six attempts, and improved to   against   opponents.

Her spontaneous joy, the symmetry of the twin afros framing her face, and the affectionate way her arms encircle her friends canâ€™t fail to raise a smile. The photograph, capturing the winner of the 1972 Miss Black and Beautiful pageant, is part of an exhibition of the work of Raphael Albert, a promoter and photographer of black beauty pageants in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Today, beauty pageants feel tawdry and anachronistic, but Albertâ€™s pictures highlight another side. As curator Renee Mussai puts it: â€œThere is a sense of laughter and solidarity that appears genuine and playful. â€ Itâ€™s not the only difference. While the women are still young, beautiful and slim, they are far from being identikit contestants. Sybil is as pretty and elegant as the stereotypical beauty queen, but her closely cropped hair is unusual, as are her competitorsâ€™ afros. Other photos show a range of skin tones, as well as curvaceous figures among the tall and slender shapes in mainstream competitions. Mussai points out that while black women could, and did, compete in mainstream beauty pageants (Grenadian Jennifer Hosten won Miss World in 1970) to do so they had to adhere to â€œEurocentricâ€ notions of beauty. The pageants Albert created and documented  â€”   complete with evening wear and swimsuit rounds  â€”   were no less objectifying than Miss World, which feminists were already protesting over (flour and tomatoes were thrown at the 1970 contests). But they offered a rare space to challenge white ideals of beauty. Mussai argues that black beauty pageants were about â€œoccupying a space that has historically negated black womenâ€. While Albertâ€™s pageants were undoubtedly a commercial proposition, by naming one Miss Black and Beautiful he was deliberately echoing the Black Power slogan â€œBlack is Beautifulâ€ which sought to overturn the way black features  â€”   skin tones, hair types  â€”   had been denigrated for centuries. Albertâ€™s pageants were relatively small and local. Still, McLean remembers that Miss Black and Beautiful packed out the Hammersmith Palais with an audience of both men and women. Notably absent were McLeanâ€™s parents, who, she says, disapproved of her entering a beauty contest (they were not so strict that they werenâ€™t thrilled when she won). Now retired from a career in human resources, the former beauty queen says race or gender politics could not have been further from her mind as a    in 1972. â€œIt was just something I decided to do. Iâ€™d seen it advertised in one of the black newspapers and it was just down the road, so I thought: â€˜Why not? â€™â€ Despite not getting a prize, she never regretted entering, and Albert, who promoted cultural events celebrating Caribbean communities and set up a magazine, became a lifelong friend until his death in 2009. Mussai says she has been struck by how the issues raised by the pageants are still being fought over today. From BeyoncÃ©â€™s Lemonade video  â€”   which showcases the diversity of black beauty with a parade of women from Serena Williams to QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis  â€”   to controversies about the lack of Hollywood actresses with darker skin tones, questions around race, beauty and gender remain. She admits to an ambivalence about the contests and their message that the most important thing about women is the way they look. But the womenâ€™s   leaves the biggest impression: in place of simpering smiles they flash broad grins or stare proudly into the camera lens. For Mussai this makes them refreshing and an illuminating insight into the â€œhedonistic confidence in a new generation of black women coming of age in Britain during the 1970sâ€. This is certainly how McLean remembers her win. â€œIt was an adventure,â€ she says, smiling, â€œIt felt wonderful. â€ Raphael Albert: Miss Black and Beautiful is at Rivington Place, London EC2A 3BA from 8 July.  . co.

The release this week of the Department of Justice report about the Baltimore police department will only amplify these demands in the public dialogue about police reform. What these solutions  â€”   which mostly focus on monitoring and policies related to individual officers  â€”   fail to do is establish functional systems of accountability which address the systemic nature of the problem of police brutality. For lasting change, Baltimore and other police departments must establish meaningful accountability of police to the communities they serve. This is because focusing on individual â€œbad copsâ€ doesnâ€™t work. Law and custom have resulted in only the most egregious and extreme incidences of police brutality being held accountable  â€”   and even then, there arenâ€™t necessarily consequences, as we saw most recently in the acquittal of the cops in the Freddie Gray case. Thus, those believing the damning justice department report signals the advent of more criminal prosecution of cops will likely be disappointed. What does work? Deterrence. The goal must be to prevent future incidents of brutality, not only to mitigate past grievances. This means we must go beyond the DoJ report to dig deeper into the reality of how police accountability happens at a state and local levels. In the vast majority of incidents in which police officers are accused of wrongdoing, punishment is handed down not by criminal courts or the federal government, but the police departmentâ€™s internal disciplinary review board. When it comes to accusations of excessive force in police brutality, review boards in Baltimore have been exceedingly lenient in their punishments of most officers.  The reason for this is obvious: those making the decisions are themselves police officers. In states that have enacted the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) legislation, internal review boards require that at least one member of the board be the same rank at the accused officer this is not only police policing police, but friends policing friends. This LEOBR legislation makes it illegal for anyone but sworn police officers to lead primary investigations of alleged brutality or to serve on the internal review board.  To illustrate how absurd this is in practice, if a police officer is accused of sexual harassment, it would be against the law to have an expert on sexual harassment weigh in on whether the police officer should be suspended or not, leaving this critical decision to fellow officers, who in many jurisdictions have no training or expertise on how to understand or address it, and who may have a personal relationship with the accused. After reviewing the practice of the Philadelphia police department, the DoJ ruled that at least one member of the internal review board should be a   police officer. Yet in 15 states, including Maryland, thatâ€™s legally impossible.  While the DoJ report mentions these state laws, it does so only in passing. And in the past, DoJ officials have told us that these state laws are â€œbeyond the purviewâ€ of their investigation. This is concerning for grassroots folk in the Baltimore community who hope the report can be used to bolster their reform efforts. Many close observers, from   Campaign Zero to the   Cato Institute, have seen the LEOBR legislation as a critical impediment to a fair process for making police officers accountable to the community when it comes to accusations of excessive force.  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice report is weakest on this particular point, which is the most important aspect to meaningful police reform. The DoJ report provides meaningful information and outlines specific policies that are problematic, but it obscures the most critical principle: that giving communities power over the institutions

I know I will have to do it. August and I need to break up, but itâ€™s hard. I still need to put my suitcase from summer holidays away, which I donâ€™t want to do because it puts a final stamp on the season, even though the truth about vacations is that the minute they end it almost feels like they never happened. Unpacking it at last, I find a pebble. I try not to collect things any more, but I canâ€™t walk away from the ocean without something in my hand, knowing that away from the water and sky, no longer warmed by the sun or a   color, itâ€™s a mere rock that looks at me blankly, like: â€œYou should know better by now. â€ The shadows begin to fall earlier and earlier, but itâ€™s still hot. Walking my shaggy,   dogs at night, I feel a stirring of wanting to wear a sweater, but I donâ€™t, since itâ€™s still about 80F. Iâ€™ve finally got my summer garb sorted out, but the florals and seersuckers and espadrilles are beginning to look droopy, a little sad. And itâ€™s still August, somehow. I keep looking at the calendar hoping to see the month end  â€”   letâ€™s just start sweater and pumpkin season already  â€”   but August does not go quickly. Its days stretch out before me, shorter than Julyâ€™s but still long enough to make me question why, if life is temporary, August just keeps going.  I suspect that the world wants to make me cry, to look mortality hard in the face, but then I think that if the world were meddling in human affairs, it would have a lot better things to do that troll me for fun. Transitions are always difficult, and itâ€™s hard to be suspended, liminal, between trapezes. I canâ€™t imagine grabbing the next one but it will happen.  Recently I was standing in line at the store and blankly regarding the Reeseâ€™s peanut butter pumpkins that have appeared next to the cash register, unable to even rouse the usual â€œpeanut butter pumpkins in August?â€ outrage in my hot, tired brain.  My year has two major sections: socks or no socks. Once the heat breaks and it cools off a bit, Iâ€™ll be back in socks. Iâ€™ll plug in my   light, and at night Iâ€™ll dream new dreams. I donâ€™t sleep well during the summer, but fall and winter are prime sleeping time. The pebble will return to the sea of long, dark nights. And next year, blinking in the pale light of spring,   season will begin again. I was wearing my usual sandals, and I heard the the kid in front of me, who seemed like one of those   types, say to the cashier: â€œI mean, women buy all these nice sandals just for the summer,â€ gesturing at my feet. He was wearing large, blocky sneakers redolent of a motherâ€™s concern for his feet getting mangled in variety of ways. â€œBut summerâ€™s almost over,â€ he sighed, the school year in his sights an actual nightâ€™s sleep in mine.  The cashier and I said in unison: â€œThereâ€™s always next year. â€",426,368,,fake

Brexit will happen. Globalisation will fall apart. Freedom of movement as an unconditional right in the EU will end. The concept of the west as upholder, and occasional enforcer, of human rights across the world is, at the very least, on hold. It is not pessimism that makes me write this, but optimism. Optimism that, if we adapt our thinking to the new reality fast enough, we can go on fighting for social justice and human rights, on behalf of that generation staring glumly at their touchscreens over the Christmas table. But that is a big if. This holiday season, I guarantee that you will hear older relatives repeatedly say the words â€œwill neverâ€. â€œBritain will never leave the EU. â€ â€œDonald Trump will never take office. â€ â€œFascism will never return to Germany and Austria. â€ Since denial is the first stage of grief, it is forgivable for people to struggle through from Brexit to Boxing Day saying these things  â€”   but not beyond. When   events happen, the denial reflex is strong because most rational people configure their principles around existing facts. For example, the European institutions that guarantee freedom of movement came to embody the principle, held by many, that borders should be as open as possible. No matter that freedom of movement within Europe was conditional on a    razor fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave at Melilla. The â€œfreedomâ€ bit seemed to embody a general principle. In future, we will have to separate our principles from institutions that once embodied them. Likewise for that more vaguely defined principle: Europeanism. It took me until the age of 40 to visit the US. By then, I had travelled by foot, air, rail and road across Europe. I was convinced this was an inexhaustible cultural playground, a place from which all my values emanated, while much of the US was simply â€œflyover countryâ€. A young generation that spends stag weekends in Riga, childhood holidays in Disney World Florida and gap years in Thailand is going to be less Europeanist than mine. But their globalism was built on the assumption that Paris or Berlin were   weekend destinations to be reached with a waft of oneâ€™s passport towards a friendly border guard. This mindset, too, will have to change. To avoid Brexit plunging us into the GDP catastrophe predicted by the Treasury, we have to pursue two outcomes: first, to minimise our break with the EU single market and, if that fails, to maximise it unsentimentally. For those gripped with the denial instinct, the objective of minimising the break comes easy  â€”   but not the means. The means through which we can achieve â€œsoft Brexitâ€ are tough,   negotiations that put the British national interest first. If we fail  â€”   because Europe is a mess, ruled by an elite in denial of its own failures  â€”   it would be logical to pursue a total reconfiguration of our trade, industrial base and attitude to globalisation. Even those, like me, fighting for the softest possible Brexit must contemplate what the social justice agenda might look like after a â€œhardâ€ one. As for the global power system, Trumpâ€™s cabinet choices show he intends to shatter it. For the first time in a generation, the section of the Israeli right prone to the most violent rhetoric about the Palestinians will go unrestrained by Washington. For the first time in a generation, human rights campaigners in Russia will have to look at the state department and the CIA as a kind of informal conduit back to Vladimir Putin and the FSB security agency, not their allies. Underlying all these changes is the fact that the global system is becoming a   game. For more than three generations, it was a   game. It is the difference between the Great British Bake Off and pass the parcel. In GBBO, even though only one person wins, there is always more cake at the end than at the start. In pass the parcel, everybody except the winner loses, and what is in the parcel is always a disappointment. Globalisation was a   game, even if, for the former industrial populations of the west, it was barely positive. It lasted so long that people began to assume    economics had become impossible. We are about to find out that is a fallacy. You can still fight for social justice, wealth redistribution and human rights in a   world  â€”   but you canâ€™t do it by clinging to â€œprinciplesâ€ you assumed were general but are not. Since free movement as an absolute right will be gone, once we leave the EU, I would reconfigure migration policy to deliver maximum social justice for two sets of people: those who already live here, including three million EU nationals and refugees, whose right to claim asylum here should be absolute. In a globalised world, â€œcompetitivenessâ€ meant a race to the bottom: low wages and a shrunken welfare state. In a   world, it means a fight to locate     jobs in the UK and not elsewhere. The weapons should be active industrial policy, tax breaks, high welfare spending and free university education, paid for by the state. Being a   state whose main ally for more than 70 years is suddenly ruled by an erratic kleptocrat who is morally indebted to the Kremlin should prompt the biggest rethink of all. For four years, at least Britain must operate diplomatically on our own. We must cease fostering the illusion that we have the power, on our own, to save the Syrian revolution, restrain Israel in its next assault on Gaza, or force Abdel Fattah   to let journalists out of jail. We should go on trying, of course, but with little promise of success. These sobering facts will confront the left and the climate movement with hard choices, just as they confront the liberal centre.

Every time he had   thoughts he should snap it so it stung. â€œThat was supposed to help curb my desires,â€ he said. But Nesbitt was not aiming to give up smoking or quit alcohol. He was trying to think himself straight. Whenever he had sexual thoughts about a man he needed to flick the band against his skin. Another time, the therapist made a strange request: close your eyes and turn yourself on.  â€œI fantasized about this guy I was attracted to and I started to get a little bit aroused heâ€™s having me kind of voice these fantasies out loud,â€ Nesbitt said. â€œBasically all of a sudden my nose just became on fire. What had happened was . .. he broke an ammonia capsule underneath my nose and now all of a sudden Iâ€™ve got this burning sensation, my eyes and nose were watering. â€ The aversion tactics failed, as did the exorcisms performed by members of a Church of Christ near Fort Worth. â€œI was just sitting there, they were all laying hands on me and trying to cast out a demon and all this stuff and I remember just thinking: this is the most ridiculous bullshit Iâ€™ve ever been through in my life,â€ Nesbitt said. â€œThe only thing they managed to exorcise was my faith. â€ Conversion therapy, also known as reparative or   therapy, has been widely discredited as unethical and ineffective but it persists in many parts of the country, usually through churches, and is a battleground issue for gay rights campaigners and those who argue that banning it would curtail religious freedom. As some conservatives seek to push back against recent advances in rights for gay and transgender people, a move is under way to add an implicitly   therapy plank to the Republican party platform that will be approved at its convention in Cleveland next week. Bryan Christopher, the   author of Hiding from Myself, a memoir about his experience with conversion therapy, said the GOPâ€™s platform plans are â€œvery troubling. I think itâ€™s a backlash from gay marriage and gay rights and gay equality, theyâ€™re really doubling down and the â€˜ â€™ platform is one of their ways of rolling back,â€ he said. â€œI think it shows that weâ€™re not as far [along] as most of us like to think we are, thereâ€™s still a lot of work to do in changing hearts and minds. â€  Last month a California court heard a challenge from a minister to the stateâ€™s     ban (enacted in 2012 and effective in 2014) on licensed therapists attempting to change the sexual orientation of  .  The practice gained fresh attention in June when a GoFundMe page was set up to raise legal fees to extricate Sarah, a    from a â€œpray away the gayâ€ camp in east Texas where she was allegedly sent by her parents against her will. The â€œSave Sarahâ€ campaign raised $64, 218. Her parents told the Austin   that this was a misrepresentation of why she was there, while the facility, Heartlight Ministries, issued a statement five days after the pageâ€™s creation denying that they provide conversion treatments or held Sarah against her will, adding that she had left. Now 45 and an atheist, Nesbitt spent three years in the   seeing the   therapist, who he said was later convicted of sexually assaulting another client. Nesbitt, who works in corporate   still lives in the region.  â€œWhen youâ€™re a kid and youâ€™re growing up and you canâ€™t tell anybody whatâ€™s going on and what youâ€™re dealing with and you get all these messages that youâ€™re an abomination, itâ€™s evil. It really does take a toll on you,â€ he said. He recalls a   type weekend at a retreat about an hour from Dallas where participants underwent intense physical activity, â€œthen they really try to break you down emotionally,â€ that was particularly tough and caused him to question not only whether he could change, but whether he should want to. The bizarre and painful experiences turned him away from the process, he said, as did becoming friends with a gay man who was happy after taking the contrasting path of coming out and accepting his sexuality.  Raised in a religious household, Sean Sala, 31, said he was in his late teens when he went to Living Hope, an â€œ â€ ministry in the Dallas region then affiliated with Exodus International, a network which shut down in 2013 and apologised for directing â€œyears of undue judgmentâ€ at the gay community. â€œThere was a room full of teenage boys who donâ€™t want to be gay. The group leader would want to know how many times we masturbated during the week and additionally they wanted to know what we were thinking,â€ Sala said. Lesbians were told to wear makeup on the basis that they would feel more feminine. â€œThere was no place in my brain at all where I believed that being gay was OK,â€ Sala said.  A US navy veteran and now an LGBT activist, he spent four to six months in the group but their tactics began to alarm him. â€œOne of the group leaders prayed and said: â€˜I really feel like you have been molested but youâ€™re just suppressing it.â€™ And I have never been molested in my life. So I would tell them, â€˜Iâ€™ve never been molested, incorrect.â€™ And then it turned into a narrative where in order for me to even participate I would have to admit that I had been molested. â€ Ricky Chelette is executive director of Living Hope, which describes itself as offering â€œsupport and resources for leaving homosexualityâ€. â€œI couldnâ€™t because of confidentiality tell you whether or not he was involved in what we did nor not,â€ said Chelette, â€œbut I mean that would not be something uncommon, to talk with people about. â€œObviously they come to us and they willingly come to us asking for help with a conflict between what they believe is their sexual practices and their faith. And so I could foresee someone asking about that or him stating something about his masturbation habits or something like that. But weâ€™re just a discipleship ministry, weâ€™re not a reparative therapy group in any way  â€¦      â€œWeâ€™re just a discipleship group that helps people to deepen their Christian walk and their faith and those are the kind of questions that I think would come up in any sort of accountability group that men would be doing. â€ Asked if he believed some of the people he has worked with have changed from being gay to straight, Chelette said: â€œIf you mean by â€˜straightâ€™ theyâ€™re no longer doing the gay practices that they may have been doing before as in hooking up with people or having sex with other people of the same gender, yes, weâ€™ve had people that have done that.  â€œBut if you mean â€˜straightâ€™ by â€˜they have a ravenous appetite for womenâ€™ then I would say thatâ€™s probably not healthy either way, and we have had people whoâ€™ve come through the ministry that have desired to have families and be married and some of those have succeeded in accomplishing that.â€œ Sala said that his efforts to become straight caused   trauma that made him want to end his life. â€œI wanted to die so much that I felt like every time I thought about dying it was like opening a Christmas present,â€ he said. Only when about to get a loaded gun from a friendâ€™s closet did he experience what he described as a spiritual realisation that nothing about him needed to change. The White House announced in April 2015 that it supports a ban on conversion therapy for minors and the Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act was introduced in Congress, but it has not passed. In the absence of a nationwide law, opponents have adopted various strategies in attempts to stymie practitioners. In February this year the Southern Poverty Law Center, Human Rights Campaign and National Center for Lesbian Rights filed a consumer fraud complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that a   group called People Can Change (PCC) which runs programmes such as a Journey Into Manhood is deceiving customers by claiming that conversion therapy works. â€œThe practice is based on the false premise that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (â€˜LGBTâ€™) is a mental illness or disorder caused by a developmental deficiency, trauma,   unmet emotional needs,â€ the complaint states. â€œThere is substantial competent and reliable scientific evidence that conversion therapy, including the methods employed by PCC, is ineffective and can and often does result in significant health and safety risks to consumers of those services, as well as economic losses  â€”   exactly the types of injuries that are at the heart of the FTCâ€™s mission to protect consumers from harm. â€ People Can Change said on their website that the complaint â€œis an attack on our first amendment rights to free speech, free assembly, and free exercise of our faith. We deserve as much respect as anyone who is â€˜out and proud,â€™ and frankly, we deserve to be left alone to live our lives as we see fit. â€ The organisations are waiting to hear if the FTC will investigate. â€œOur hope is that they will establish a broad federal rule that will apply to any conversion therapy provider anywhere in the country,â€ said Scott McCoy, senior staff attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Last year a group called Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing was ordered to pay $72, 400 in damages to former clients after a New Jersey jury decided it committed consumer fraud when it claimed gay people could be â€œcuredâ€ through methods including telling participants to beat an effigy of their mother with a tennis racquet and stripping naked in group sessions. Conversion therapy for minors is banned in five states and Washington DC. In May, Vermont became the latest state to prohibit it. Local laws are also being explored and enacted by cities. Miami Beach passed a ban for minors last month while activists in Dallas are hoping the city council will approve an ordinance later this year, but acknowledge they face an uphill task at the state level. â€œThe leadership here in Texas is not exactly friendly to LGBT people or issues,â€ said Rafael McDonnell of the Resource Center, an LGBT community centre in Dallas. An attempt to ban conversion therapy for minors in Texas failed to make it through the legislature during last yearâ€™s session. In the face of growing opposition to the practice and recent advances for LGBT rights, the Texas Republican party has reiterated its support for conversion therapy and its opposition to gay rights. The Texas GOP signalled its backing for conversion therapy by describing it as legitimate and efficient in a plank of its 2014 platform and   it in its latest manifesto, adopted by party members in May.  It calls for overturning last yearâ€™s US supreme court decision legalising   marriage nationwide and states: â€œNo laws or executive orders shall be imposed to limit or restrict access to sexual orientation change efforts for   youth and adults. â€ It also says that â€œHomosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has [sic] been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nations [sic] founders, and shared by the majority of Texans. â€ Nesbitt believes that the massacre of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Florida last month adds urgency to efforts to end a practice founded on the idea that being gay is a form of sickness. â€œIn the wake of Orlando I think itâ€™s more important than ever to get our message out there and to fight against these sorts of things, because thatâ€™s one of the major problems with the whole reparative therapy movement,â€ he said.  â€œThat if reparative therapy works, if itâ€™s a healthy thing to do and it can be done  â€¦     then homosexuality is a choice. And if itâ€™s a choice then itâ€™s a lot easier to demonize it. â€ Recalling how believing that he was a sinner made him depressed, Nesbitt said he â€œwas buying all that hook, line and sinker and of course it makes you feel like youâ€™re a failure. The reality is that Iâ€™d known I was gay since I was probably ten years old, itâ€™s not something I chose, itâ€™s not something that was developed out of some terrible event in my childhood, itâ€™s just another part of my personality, just another part of who I am. â€",596,690,9.15E+17,fake

The president this week announced Jeffrey DeLaurentis as his choice to become the first American ambassador to Cuba in more than half a century, aiming to put the seal on his detente with the communist island nation. But while Havana welcomed the move, Republican senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas have pledged to block any ambassador nomination, citing a lack of progress in democracy and human rights. Asked to rate the chances of DeLaurentis being approved, Ãsgeir SigfÃºsson, spokesman for the American Foreign Service Association, said: â€œI would say 0%. With Marco Rubio on the Senate foreign relations committee, itâ€™s never going to happen. â€ Rubio and Cruz are both sons of Cuban immigrants. â€œThey have sworn to do anything they can against the normalisation of relations,â€ SigfÃºsson added. â€œHe might not even get a hearing. â€ It is therefore a seemingly futile gesture on Obamaâ€™s part, SigfÃºsson said. â€œThe president is exercising his right to be a late lame duck president trying to do everything he can. Itâ€™s symbolic. He drove through the normalisation of relations and gets to claim heâ€™s the one who did it. â€ The US and Cuba severed diplomatic ties in 1961, deep in the cold war. Obama and President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba made a surprise announcement in December 2014 that they had secretly agreed to restore diplomatic relations, including reopening embassies in each otherâ€™s countries. Obama made a historic visit in March, and commercial flights resumed last month. Obama called the naming of an ambassador a â€œcommonsenseâ€ step toward more productive relations and said DeLaurentis  â€”   currently the top diplomat at the US embassy in Havana  â€”   is the best person for the job. â€œThere is no public servant better suited to improve our ability to engage the Cuban people and advance US interests in Cuba than Jeff,â€ the president said in a statement. â€œJeffâ€™s leadership has been vital throughout the normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba. â€ He added: â€œHaving an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests, and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government. We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador. â€ On Wednesday, Gustavo MachÃ­n, deputy director for US affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry, described the news as â€œwelcomeâ€ but said he will use a bilateral commission meeting in Washington on Friday to push for more. â€œThe Cuban delegation will point out the lack of advances in the economic, commercial sphere,â€ MachÃ­n said in Havana. â€œWe consider the measures adopted by President Obamaâ€™s administration are positive but still insufficient and limited. â€  Obama should also use his executive power to further narrow the trade embargo imposed on Cuba after its 1959 revolution, Machin said. â€œIf the president could   â€¦     allow investment in telecoms, why canâ€™t he authorise investments in other areas?â€ Cubaâ€™s top diplomat in Washington, JosÃ© CabaÃ±as, was given the rank of ambassador last year. But the battle over â€œour man in Havanaâ€ is already under way. Rubio said: â€œJust like releasing all terrorists from GuantÃ¡namo and sending US taxpayer dollars to the Iranian regime, rewarding the Castro government with a US ambassador is another   legacy project for the president that needs to be stopped. â€œA US ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial and closed regime. This nomination should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people, and until longstanding concerns about the Cuban regimeâ€™s theft of property and crimes against American citizens are addressed. â€ Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the state department and foreign operations, took a different view. â€œ[DeLaurentis] is a career diplomat who is universally respected by his peers, and by Democrats and Republicans in Congress, for his intellect, his integrity, and his thoughtfulness,â€ he said. â€œThe decision to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba has been widely supported, and the number of Americans traveling to Cuba is increasing dramatically. We need an ambassador who knows Cuba, who is respected by the Cuban government, and who will stand up for US interests and values. Jeff is that person. The Cuban people have their ambassador in Washington. The American people need their ambassador in Havana. â€ Since diplomatic relations were restored on 20 July last year, DeLaurentis has led negotiations with Cuba on issues including the billions of dollars in US claims against Cuba for properties that were confiscated during the revolution. The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, said earlier this month that, if elected, he would undo Obamaâ€™s efforts at rapprochement unless Cuba permits religious freedoms and releases political prisoners. After a logjam last year that left numerous   ambassadors in limbo, the situation has much improved with eight awaiting confirmation, of whom five are expected to be approved this week, according to SigfÃºsson.",255,857,"438718106459176960	439435608487108608	440210777266733056	440210927687069696	440239321728032768	440253258586939392	440255204886605824	440256049895845890	440261523249070080	440266989245042688	440268119076904960	440272268842008576	440274128012976128	440274464790814721	440286213661290496	440291864277966849	440300547942273024	440312608923848704	440317166588792832	440318615619768320	440357872417779712	440362695905132544	440370524259364865	440392433822486529	440409568934232064	440442660739121152	440475509546160130	440485608528818176	440485924657717250	440496150747938817	440505613140099073	440513730095640576	440514123093127168	440518169233350658	440519666315042816	440519957806600193	440520956520308737	440538639546605568	440540291330633728	440540576539095041	440540595165995008	440540646533644288	440540654389587968	440540660152557568	440540661524086785	440540697947430913	440540744730693632	440542566987993089	440543678306983937	440550475205984256	440550709432311808	440564732093669376	440574099270537218	440578219897798656	440578228260847616	440580532770861056	440587089743065088	440605102030979072	440608532870623232	440626368473096192	440643930074251265	440647288633843712	440678691933523968	440680401980628993	440722659056164865	440760955895418880	440787084190547969	440825710207569920	440902161342275584	440946988721655808	440947576045846529	440952575274127360	441047431489146880	441246621947666433	441247201139113984	441312691504705536	441413428301668352	441672631470014464	442028985891815424	442122401078587392	442586586933243904	442689201025191936	444009798997377024	448802582975107072	574397399067725824	574449417039708160	574558160410820609	574631757879906305	574645585795481600	574714110740291584	574749168457007105	574771322896715776	574830220714205184	574886077107945473	574918985558290433	574927151935389696	574928290684735489	574946903697276928	574975825038163968	574979485860126721	575031854232793088	575044190339526658	575060404298080256	575069649903185920	575073778436206594	575089562080280576	575099759624609792	575101467968860161	575146727956553728	575228172318478337	575285799773671424	575440684842274816	590006895387222017	596958294951866370	597400214719373314	597427018364497920	597427263513227264	597429804321869824	597475940571152384	597491791147970560	597740554470952960	597789564548165632	597793623267221504	597803666746277888	597831649959743488	597898141665472512	597898353830068224	597912880227426304	597945283549343745	597969771095728128	709917343003090944	710115081007267840	710188648470331392	710276938728808448	710294300253429760	710319780620857344	710337793692545024	710402441322356736	710484113480880128	710484892807786496	710500112934506496	710617159504941057	710617468356534272	710646854472605697	710668155413254144	710668705839972352	710694833950687232	710884102908424192	710894156269363200	710907265428144129	711225183089008641	711249896980897794	711294208309526528	711307377249820676	711326646696071168	711366655192989696	711383217660686336	711401742005608448	711502849604071425	711524383290884097	711574858925219840	711619081649184768	711623531533111296	711799345549611008	711806115529371648	711899638190637057	711941535487537152	711998271254880257	712006374608265217	712019228770045952	712023257789046784	712026565819760641	712065299479015424	712077580497756160	712084550403264512	712168426773553152	712255531973529601	712442941688696837	712449093252079616	716697214052134914	724409801531219969	844390792789667840	844675459673706497	844696302319489024	844798313543041025	845659961367638016	845740767112970240	845778931571724289	845856128076533760	845881373629923329	845883055608868864	846003359786160128	846008181507571713	846054114563964928	846060267784097792	846065634840662017	846066263956819968	846066310723317766	846068292015972352	846080665607159808	846115804362018816	846123080955047936	846130031336271872	846131554074054659	846132939561877508	846155188603830272	846169023960240129	846174261089742849	846182361045786624	846245673305604096	846268094045552640	846300508876877826	846301060746534912	846304684545654785	846349972681326592	846351051783467009	846357586635100160	846365181491990528	846366958450827264	846376672290996224	846377830283984900	846381028981837825	846427549026607104	846427652609183744	846442111943823361	846447195146534912	846471877614850049	846476136385269760	846481557133025280	846558294403665920	846565226078224384	846568953983873024	846714761752592385	847234442410074112	847257234371354624	848515250869510144	848520107781435392	848520159073640448	848796830876008449	868184119083184129",fake

On this evidence Robert Snodgrassâ€™s left foot should be among the primary exhibits. For the threadbare hopes of its football clubâ€™s   future appear to hang on the Scotland internationalâ€™s use of it. Snodgrass has now converted or created exactly half of Hullâ€™s 16 Premier League goals, and for 20 minutes his sixth of the season, an exquisite   threatened to atone for his compatriot David Marshallâ€™s   howler. That it did not and that Hull sit one point off the bottom rather than three is down to another recurring theme: an inability to turn good performances into wins. Having handed Ronald Koemanâ€™s team one equaliser on the stroke of   via Marshallâ€™s sliced punch into his own net, they conceded a second to the recalled Ross Barkleyâ€™s late header. Hull, refusing to be deflated by the final 20 minutes of their defeat on the same turf by Manchester City on Boxing Day, started adventurously and took a   lead through their   scorer, the central defender Michael Dawson. Like Snodgrassâ€™s it was a quality finish. Neither did Mike Phelanâ€™s team lack spirit. â€œWe are off the bottom of the league,â€ Phelan enthused. â€œAt times this season things havenâ€™t gone our way but the players are all putting a real shift in. They are listening, learning and have everything to look forward to, which is progress up this league. We have a real battle on our hands in the second half of the season but I think weâ€™re up for it. â€ Phelan spoke in the   to this contest of the need to reinforce his squad with players â€œcourageousâ€ enough for the fight ahead. Yet it is the grossest of understatements to say that Hull is an even harder sell now than when he did his last recruitment pitch in August on the back of wins from both their opening fixtures. Nor have his set of summer transfer window purchases proved a raging success. Ryan Mason, the clubâ€™s Â£12. 5m record signing from Tottenham, went missing in a relegation duel at Middlesbrough in the first week of December and has not been spotted in a starting XI since neither has Markus Henriksen, whose permanent Â£3. 5m move from AZ Alkmaar is to be ratified next week Dieumerci Mbokani has been praised for his   play but is yet to score in 10 appearances since returning to the English top flight. Two former Manchester United trainees Will Keane and Mike Weir have proved peripheral. The Scotland goalkeeper Marshall, a moderate success, has shipped an average of 2. 42 goals a game, and showed himself prone to panicking under pressure soon after Dawsonâ€™s finish from a   Snodgrass corner had put Hull ahead. The sucker punch, quite literally, came in   injury time, when Kevin Mirallas swung over a corner and Marshall was cramped by the presence of his own striker Mbokani in his attempt to fist away. The ball skewed backwards for one of the more bizarre Premier League goals of the season. â€œEverything is fizzing around your head  â€”   what you want to say to the players, you know exactly what you want to do and, when that happens with 10 seconds to go, it changes your whole thinking,â€ said Phelan, of his   team talk plans. Marshallâ€™s next touch three minutes into the resumption went the same way. Crucially this time, however, his fingertips proved the difference between Romelu Lukakuâ€™s deflected drive hitting the crossbar and flying beneath it. Then, after Snodgrass found his range by striking the bar in the   via a classical       â€”   Leighton Bainesâ€™s header against the base of a post just shy of the   was the first of the attempts against the frame of the goal  â€”   he put Hull back in front. One of Harry Maguireâ€™s   marches from deep was crudely halted by Baines, and Snodgrass got the trajectory just right, arcing the ball perfectly into the top corner despite Roblesâ€™ attempts to claw it away. Koeman cited the Yorkshire clubâ€™s potency from   situations  â€”   â€œwe knew theyâ€™d scored eight out of 14 goals like that,â€ he said afterwards but conceded that nullifying Snodgrassâ€™ quality was another matter. The same could be said of Hullâ€™s attempts to muzzle Barkley, a player previously dropped as a â€œ  callâ€ by Koeman. Appearing to have been energised by that, and perhaps by the fact Gareth Southgate was among the crowd, he emerged to head in Bainesâ€™ dink. â€œI hope it gives Ross a boost,â€ Koeman said. â€œI think he was the player that we expect in his position. We spoke about him being more dangerous in front of goal, to have better offensive movement and he was really important in the final part of attacking. â€",798,464,1.00E+18,fake
politifact15108,http://www.trendolizer.com/2017/07/breaking-trump-removes-muslim-federal-judge-for-trying-to-implement-sharia-law-in-america.html,BREAKING: Trump Removes Muslim Federal Judge For Trying To Implement Sharia Law In America,"Nominees: Anthony Anderson,   Ansari, Master of NoneWill Forte, The Last Man On EarthWilliam H Macy, ShamelessThomas Middleditch, Silicon ValleyJeffrey Tambor, Transparent, Moylan: It seems like Jeffrey Tambor has his second Emmy win all tied up for playing Maura (nee Mort) Pfefferman on Amazonâ€™s breakout series. Heâ€™s certainly deserving, vacillating between confusion, acceptance, anger and pathos sometimes in the same scene. However, this is an especially packed category with many possible spoilers, especially criticsâ€™ favorite Aziz Ansari.  Schilling: Tambor is the easy choice. To borrow a reference from the NFL, this is like picking the New England Patriots to win the AFC East. Itâ€™s close to a foregone conclusion that Tambor has this category to himself for as long as Transparent is on the air. As such, Iâ€™m using this opportunity to lodge a protest vote in favor of Will Forte, the star and lead creative visionary behind the most unique sitcom on TV. The Last Man on Earth somehow combines   with relationship comedy and genuine pathos on a weekly basis. Forteâ€™s performance is the nexus of all that. He has a unique ability to make the audience love him and hate him in equal measure in every scene. Moylan: Sorry, but I donâ€™t understand your sports references, but choosing anyone other than Tambor is like choosing the Red Sox to win the Super Bowl  â€”   it might be amusing to think it could happen, but itâ€™s never really going to. If weâ€™re talking about who should win, my vote is for Thomas Middleditch, who blends physical comedy and excellent acting the same way Tom Brady blends manliness and an Uggs endorsement deal. (Am I doing this football thing right?)  Nominees:  Ellie Kemper, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Julia   Veep Laurie Metcalf, Getting On Tracee Ellis Ross,   Amy Schumer, Inside Amy Schumer Lily Tomlin, Grace and Frankie, Moylan: The biggest problem with the Emmys is that it always awards the same people year after year, making it more boring than driverâ€™s ed taught by a murmuring monk. Thatâ€™s not to say that Julia   doesnâ€™t deserve to win for the fifth year in a row for her genius Selena Meyer, and she certainly will, it just would be nice for someone like Tracee Ellis Ross, who spins gold 22 weeks a year on a much more traditional sitcom get some recognition. Schilling: Youâ€™re two for two on the safe choices, Moylan. Amy Schumer has not won an acting Emmy for Inside Amy Schumer yet. The ubiquitous nature of her presence in the media for the last three years makes this a surprising statistic, but also one that is destined not to last for much longer. With the uncertainty around whether or not the series will return, it seems an opportune time to reward her acting work. This will be one of those, â€œOh, youâ€™re almost too famous to be hereâ€ awards that the Emmys love to hand out. Moylan: I may be picking safe choices, but if weâ€™re choosing who is going to win, the Emmys loves a safe choice. I donâ€™t agree with them always, but there you have it. The problem with Schumer is she has been absolutely everywhere and I think that the backlash is starting (especially considering the controversy sheâ€™s facing for a writerâ€™s rape jokes). Also, the last season of Inside Amy Schumer was really weak and almost seemed like an afterthought to everything else she has going on. And since weâ€™re talking about â€œtoo famous to be hereâ€ awards, Lily Tomlin deserves one far more than Amy Schumer, even though her show is just as weak. Nominees: Bryan Cranston, All The WayBenedict Cumberbatch, SherlockIdris Elba, LutherCuba Gooding Jr, The People v OJ SimpsonTom Hiddleston, The Night ManagerCourtney B Vance, The People v OJ Simpson, Moylan: This is a category of winners. Between Cranston, Cumberbatch, Elba, Gooding and Hiddleston they have won five Emmys, two Golden Globes, one Oscar, and Taylor Swiftâ€™s heart (before losing it again). But Courtney B Vance is the one who will be the winner this year as part of The People V OJ Simpsonâ€™s absolute sweep of the limited series categories.  Schilling: I apologize for being a contrarian the last two categories. No one likes an awards show prognostication hipster. Courtney B Vance deserves this one, even in such a stacked category. Matching the charisma of Johnnie Cochran is not an easy assignment for any actor, but Vance claimed every aspect of that role, imbuing it with humor, rage and sadness. This is my favorite TV performance of the year, from my favorite drama of the year. Color me mystified that Cuba Gooding Jrâ€™s lacking portrayal of OJ Simpson made the cut, though. I wrote extensively about how far away from the real Simpson he got, and I fear that having two actors from the same   in this category could split the vote and cost Vance the Emmy. Moylan:  I totally agree about Gooding, who hasnâ€™t found an opportunity to be the worst thing about any project heâ€™s in, including Radio. (Remember Radio? Please donâ€™t say you remember Radio.) Iâ€™m surprised he got nominated as well and I donâ€™t think that Vance has to worry about him stealing votes. Hey, letâ€™s not forget that this category has three gentlemen or color vying for a trophy. Take that, #OscarsSoWhite. Nominees:Kirsten Dunst, FargoFelicity Huffman, American CrimeAudra McDonald, Lady Day at Emersonâ€™s Bar  GrillSarah Paulson, The People v OJ SimpsonLili Taylor, American CrimeKerry Washington, Confirmation, Moylan: Congratulations, Sarah Paulson, on your first Emmy win. This is the surest thing since Reaganâ€™s second term, BeyoncÃ© winning all the VMAs for Lemonade and Kanye West writing â€œKanye Westâ€ when he votes for president this November. I feel bad for everyone else nominated, because they have no shot at all.  Schilling: Confirmation was fine. American Crime was   and didnâ€™t make much of a dent in the cultural conversation. Real talk, I didnâ€™t see Lady Day at Emersonâ€™s Bar  Grill. I guess I was too busy binging season two of Daredevil, like a freakinâ€™ nerd. I think this is between Paulson and Kirsten Dunst. Sarah Paulson wins, because People vs OJ Simpson is going to clean up every single one of these    movie awards. Honestly, itâ€™ll be a bloodbath. The whole cast and crew might as well be seated in folding chairs on the stage, since thatâ€™s where they will spend most of the evening. Moylan: My heart really goes out to Kiki Dunst who gave one of the best television performances of the year on Fargo. Her final scene in the back of the police cruiser trying to explain her crimes will be seared in my memory forever. If it werenâ€™t the year of OJ sheâ€™d finally have a trophy of her own.  Nominees: Jesse Plemons, FargoBokeem Woodbine, FargoHugh Laurie, The Night ManagerSterling K Brown, The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime StoryDavid Schwimmer, The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime StoryJohn Travolta, The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story, Moylan: Expect Sterling K Brown to ride the wave of OJ actors (with middle initials!) taking home statues.   Nominees: Niecy Nash, Getting OnAllison Janney, MomKate McKinnon, Saturday Night LiveJudith Light, TransparentGaby Hoffmann, TransparentAnna Chlumsky, Veep, Moylan: My mind is telling me Allison Janney, but my body is telling me Niecy Nash.   Nominees: Maura Tierney, The AffairMaggie Smith, Downton Abbey Lena Headley, Game Of ThronesEmilia Clarke, Game Of ThronesMaisie Williams, Game Of ThronesConstance Zimmer, UnREAL, Moylan: This race is too close to call, so I beg the Academy to vote for the amazing Constance Zimmer.

politifact13936,mainerepublicemailalert.com/2017/03/24/breaking-autopsy-results-from-vince-fosters-exhumed-body-cause-of-death-to-be-changed/,BREAKING: Autopsy Results From Vince Foster’s Exhumed Body–Cause Of Death To Be Changed,"After CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert told viewers that lawyers representing his old Comedy Central show said he couldnâ€™t be â€œStephen Colbertâ€ anymore, he thumbed his nose at them with a transparent dodge. Lawyers representing his old company complained to CBS after he revived the character he played under his own name on The Colbert Report  â€”   a clueless,    cable news host. They said that the character â€œStephen Colbertâ€ was their intellectual property, â€œwhich is surprising, since I never considered that guy much of an intellectâ€ Colbert said on the Late Show on Wednesday. The audience booed when Colbert, â€œwith a heavy heartâ€ said it has been decreed that the character is kaput. â€œI feel the same way, but what can I do?â€ Colbert said. â€œThe lawyers have spoken. I cannot reasonably argue that I own my own face and name. And as much as Iâ€™d like to have that guy on again, I canâ€™t. â€ He then introduced â€œStephen Colbertâ€™s identical cousinâ€ an interview with himself displaying the same cocked eyebrow expression his old character had. Then the real Colbert did one of the old showâ€™s most popular recurring segments, retitling The Word to The Werd. CBS declined comment on Thursday. Representatives from Comedy Central and its corporate parent, Viacom, did not immediately return messages. Until 2005, when CBS split from Viacom, the two networks were corporate cousins. Since starting at the Late Show last fall, Colbert has struggled to establish himself with his own personality. So fans were delighted last week when he briefly brought the old character back. The Late Show has been making an aggressive play for attention with two weeks of live shows coinciding with the Republican and Democratic conventions. Besides the reappearance of his character, old friend Jon Stewart appeared last week for his first extended comic riffs on TV since leaving Comedy Centralâ€™s The Daily Show. During his interview on Wednesdayâ€™s show, Colbertâ€™s â€œidentical cousinâ€ said: â€œStephen, whenever you need me, wild horses ridden by corporate lawyers could not keep me away. â€ The Werd segment was identical to what he used to do, except for the â€˜eâ€™ in the name. On a split screen, Colbert narrated a story while printed messages on the other side provided the punchlines. For instance, Colbert said that during the coming campaign, Hillary Clinton will say things that will make Donald Trump appear to be a racist.

politifact13747,https://web.archive.org/web/20170205045142/http://departedmedia.com/bill-gates-i-think-donald-trump-will-go-down-to-history-as-one-of-the-greatest-presidents-just-like-reagan/,"Bill Gates: “I think Donald Trump will go down to history as one of the greatest presidents, just like Reagan.”","In February of this year, comedian Louis CK wrote that he had chosen to abandon conventional TV production, host his new series Horace and Pete on his website and charge per episode for a show that was as much TV play as a comedy. He wanted to â€œcreate a show in a new way [and] provide it to you directly and immediately, without the usual promotion, banner ads, billboards and clips that tell you what the show feels and looks like before you get to see it for yourselfâ€. He was more interested in Horace and Pete being tweeted about by the guy with 400 followers than the guy with 400, 000. What Louis CK was seeking to manufacture was something that the creators of High Maintenance had already managed.  In 2012, husband and wife creative team Ben Sinclair and Katja Blichfeld started to fill their weekends by shooting in friendsâ€™ apartments, using the resources at hand and putting 10 to 20 minute â€œsnackableâ€ episodes online. The two were looking for something to work on together, and this DIY experiment was it. Sinclair had been working as an actor and Blichfeld had been working as a casting director who had won an Emmy for her work on 30 Rock. She began to draw on her pool of acquaintances to cast some of the episodes. Soon it was Vimeoâ€™s first ever original series: the guy with 400 followers liked what he saw and a cult web series was born. It weaves a tapestry of idiosyncratic characters and disparate stories across New York, all connected by a shared weed dealer (â€œthe guyâ€) a   affable hipster whose day job opens doors and allows brief insights into the lives and homes of the people inside. Thereâ€™s a couple who are Airbnbing their spare room, a guy tending to his sick mother in a claustrophobic flat, and a character called Homeless Heidi. Coming across it accidentally back then was like opening a wardrobe door and finding a faun and a lamp post within. Now itâ€™s back and on television, this time on HBO, with the first of six new episodes debuting tonight. Over the phone, Sinclair and Blichfeld say that theyâ€™ve been answering the same question a lot of late, one that possibly vocalises their own chief preoccupation of the past year  â€”   is High Maintenance going to be different now that itâ€™s on HBO? Sinclair, who writes, directs and plays â€œthe guyâ€ says that the challenge was to maintain the tightness that made the web series so irresistible and addictive. â€œOur primary duty this year as we experienced it was to maintain that intimacy,â€ he says, â€œand sometimes it felt like it was an uphill battle. â€ Blichfeld agrees, saying that they succeeded in keeping it intimate within the bigger production by choosing â€œto remain the sole creatives on this showâ€. They kept the cast small and continued to shoot in tiny apartments around New York in spite of the   crew, the chief difference now being that everyone was getting paid and that they could hire a second apartment for the spillover. â€œWeâ€™re still learning as   and weâ€™re always trying to stretch ourselves to see how we can tell stories in even more interesting ways,â€ Sinclair says, stressing that itâ€™s not all about looking back however. New Yorkâ€™s apartments in all their odd sizes, shapes and locations continue to be obsessed over in the new series, with objects and decorations acting as visual aids to enrich the story and character development. In the new episodes a cereal bowl left on the coffee table until nightfall warns of approaching tears and the home gym equipment brandished in the living room spells a particular type of trouble. Sinclair and Blichfeld have spoken about writing scripts based on the spaces they had at their disposal, and in spite of no longer having budget restrictions, High Maintenance benefits from this approach they havenâ€™t been able to shake off. Each new episode has the thrill of a   stand, offering a momentary insight into a strangerâ€™s mind and personality through the interior of their home. If restrictions proved to be the mother of invention, what is their creative approach now? â€œWe still have restrictions, believe it or not, because the expectation is different,â€ Blichfeld says, â€œbecause weâ€™re not following a core cast of characters we can just keep building on. Itâ€™s almost like every episode is a mini movie, a short film, a little pilot. Itâ€™s still a challenge to come up with that multiple worlds for that   block. â€  Previously these multiple worlds were inspired by a friendâ€™s quirk or an actorâ€™s personality, with Blichfeld and Sinclair often suiting the form and writing to the artist they were working with. (The writing that was so informed by restrictions last year won Sinclair and Blichfeld a prestigious Writerâ€™s Guild award for the episode entitled Rachel.) HBO the canvas is wider and blanker, and Sinclair says that the previous episodes put them under pressure too. â€œWeâ€™ll think of an idea but now we have 19 episodes filled with some version of that idea that we may be recycling or we might not be recycling, so thereâ€™s all the constraints of what weâ€™ve already done before on top of all these new ideas. â€ Then he rallies, â€œBut we are going to surprise you every episode and give you wallop. â€ High Maintenanceâ€™s portrayal of Brooklyn bohemia manages to eschew any irritation or offence that the much maligned and too often badly portrayed subject might cause. Blichfeld seems to think that â€œnot everyone would agree with thatâ€ but says that they try to never â€œplay the judgment of things outâ€. In spite of depicting characters like vegetarians who donâ€™t want to kill a mouse in their house or an engaged couple who become urban â€˜preppersâ€™ each episode subverts and defies expectations, removing it from any possible stereotype. â€œWeâ€™re always trying to be observational or presentational and not trying to play a message,â€ Blichfeld says. â€œWeâ€™re not making fun of people. â€ They donâ€™t draw any   according to Sinclair, because like someone on Twitter said to him during the week, â€œHigh Maintenance shows people at their best and their worstâ€™ and maybe thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to get at. â€ The new episodes have built upon the earlier ones seamlessly, as though the only discernable difference between HBO and Vimeo were the money and the size of the crew. Sinclair and Blichfeld say they were given complete creative control. In the new six episodes thereâ€™s more interconnective tissue between the stories and character development and backstory play a bigger role, like in the case of Max from the web series (known to previous HM fans as the guy saved as â€œAssholeâ€ in â€˜the guyâ€™sâ€™ phone after he steals a bag of weed). Thereâ€™s a good mixture of returning favourites (Dan Stevens and Hannibal Buress are back) new arrivals, such as the surprising   protagonist of the third episode, and things seem to have sexed up across the boards perhaps to fill that 11pm slot. â€œThe guyâ€ may also have a new bike. High Maintenance remains a hit of pure unadulterated joy, its deft characterizations and presentational comedy retaining the same surefootedness it had when it inhabited the purer space of a web series. Itâ€™s move to HBO will not harm it or lose it its cult following. Bigger and just as bold, Sinclair and Blichfeld have succeeded in retaining the poignancy and gentleness that counters the sharp observational humour throughout. â€œUltimately weâ€™re about people and pot is a way into people,â€ Sinclair says. â€œAnd we like pot. â€",936,942,"827982406913241088	827983104602091520	827983104367173632	827983104337813506	827983105545818114	827983105399025664	827983105147297792	827983513542619137	827985266153369602	827987486982836224	827987492762554368	827992345572438017	827996383273709569	828007212983390212	828008934120251392	828023445321555968	828030940358270976	828031715801169920	828032480871526400	828035324064444416	828040817948360704	828045380692668416	828051740490682368	828062330395168769	828069010185007104	828072473988100097	828075236973215745	828075595397464064	828076827168079873	828076900732006401	828077528459964416	828077987966894080	828080485897113600	828080559695998980	828080730634862592	828082832367112192	828086152179617793	828086744750911488	828087599105449985	828095614000963584	828098910388236288	828108943213867008	828110029953888256	828111153427599360	828115699004473344	828116021055729666	828117209209827329	828117242235781120	828121226744770560	828129132575760384	828129177979256832	828135553958715392	828156684417765377	828181125247950849	828186058483445760	828208981885612033	828213291663183874	828219637053714432	828238303996608512	828239007737925632	828247442852368384	828255873902530561	828261970570797056	828268369942032384	828269239572234240	828270907340812288	828271166716596224	828271185922256896	828272289758208000	828273376858865664	828275827141857280	828278691973255173	828278991631085570	828282553220096001	828284398390894595	828290563833212930	828292260995461122	828300371550408704	828301921593262081	828302556434665472	828302984224182273	828306584635850752	828316430378606593	828317351099654145	828318630890835971	828321308614225920	828329426425434112	828337485495287808	828339290438512643	828343066633269248	828344170892890113	828348789987631104	828358805624860676	828362825122787329	828364668863393792	828374402299473920	828379724942626817	828390121175130112	828397702396465154	828398716360990721	828415578402648065	828418137657851905	828431737206222849	828438561720504323	828439934604152832	828456619503734790	828457174112333825	828492817072807936	828495337836920832	828497520728891392	828537125285064704	828542462410969088	828568147506573312	828571048979226624	828577167500001280	828638217805164544	828640256320614401	828663676668375040	828670584137641984	828830948036853761	828852587218792448	829392373566148608	829420990790828040	829437803477954560	829502628539355136	829559436649889792	829679386110603265	829716613142343685	829728742217953280	830425374588669952	830437766462898176	830505042859917313	830624524303552512	830928582289551360	831418859676512257	831418863732420608	831427052419108864	832260764325003264	832296165777481729	832365093396570112	832589936293343237	833905029224423424	835159584436256768	835220128518164480	835223868088385536	835389948148711425	835461184094629888	835462544806424576	835475784680804353	835475816154791937	835495871420772352	835496109036482561	835515552516931586	835660365862174720	835968005737701376	836098131741851649	836184353575170052	836228171473256450	836242707416743937	836284882724663296	836318050022350848	836411327493128192	836482061062008832	836522549416611840	836590419504852994	836591506907488256	836613167707013120	836644510797074432	836648325168390146	836796838296633345	840379377418416128	840535410614886400	841315638119288833	841597091109568512	841744233929285634	959063649817186304	1000364702965387264",fake
politifact15161,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykoOLSlzuEc,"Florida Bridge Collapse, Female Company","The US is the closest itâ€™s ever been to breaking the   male stronghold on the presidency. Though American women have made some political gains during that period, there has only been one woman so far with a real chance of smashing that glass ceiling: Hillary Clinton. And yet some women, especially young women, have greeted Clintonâ€™s historic candidacy with muted enthusiasm. â€œI want there to be a woman president, of course,â€ said Maria Alcivar, a graduate student at Iowa State University and reluctant Clinton supporter. â€œI just donâ€™t see why it had to be her. â€ Across the country over the last 18 months, several women have expressed similar sentiments: a wish that the potential first female leader was someone less flawed and less polarizing. Experts say there is no predictable route to the presidency for a female candidate, not least because the trail is still being blazed. But there is a case to be made that the first woman to get this close to the presidency would probably look a lot like Clinton: a nationally recognizable figure with an extensive rÃ©sumÃ© and close proximity to power. â€œThereâ€™s a saying, the first into battle needs to wear the most armor,â€ said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which studies women running for executive office. She continued: â€œBecause women have higher and harder barriers to clear the path to executive office, the women that win need to exceed expectations  â€”   so by comparison they tend to be more qualified than their opponents. â€ A 2011 study identified what the researchers called the â€œJackie (and Jill) Robinson effectâ€ a reference to the first African American player in Major League Baseball. Robinson broke baseballâ€™s color barrier in 1947 and by no coincidence, according to the theory, he remains one of the best players of all time. The study found that female lawmakers outperform their male colleagues, introducing more legislation and delivering more financial projects to their home districts. This, the researchers suggest, is the result of underlying gender discrimination, which narrows the prospective pool of female candidates down to only the most qualified, talented and politically ambitious.  â€œOne of the reasons itâ€™s taking so long to elect a woman president is because very few women have actually run for president,â€ said Jennifer Lawless, the director of the Women  Politics Institute at American University. The first may have been Victoria Woodhull in 1872, nearly 50 years before women won the vote, and 136 years before Clintonâ€™s first competitive campaign in 2008. The gender gap leaves a very narrow pipeline to the top, Lawless said. The most common route to the US presidency is through the Senate or a governorâ€™s mansion, which greatly narrows the pool of prospective female candidates, since there are currently only 20 women serving in the   US Senate, 84 congresswomen (19%) and six female governors. Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 1987, has spent a lot of time over the last 18 months thinking about what has changed for women since she first entered Congress in 1973. â€œSexism is a lot harder to pinpoint than it was but itâ€™s clearly still there,â€ she said. When Schroeder first arrived in Congress she faced questions from her male colleagues about how she managed to raise two small children while being a lawmaker. On one occasion she snapped back: â€œI have a brain and a uterus and I use both. â€ She was also advised never to wear green. It apparently was not a power color. Research shows that women who run for elective office win at comparable rates to men. Party trumps gender at the ballot box. That is to say, male and female voters overwhelmingly support their partyâ€™s candidate, regardless of gender. In an analysis of 2010 House races, female candidates received as many votes as male candidates of the same seat status (incumbent, open seat, challenger) according to a study by Kathleen Dolan published in her 2014 book, When Does Gender Matter? Women Candidates and Gender Stereotypes in American Elections.  And yet women seeking to run for office still encounter barriers their male counterparts do not. Studies show they are less likely to express interest in a political career and more likely to doubt their ability to run. Women are less likely to put themselves forward and need to be recruited to run for office, research suggests. Ivy Taylor, the mayor of San Antonio, said she did not start her career expecting to run for public office. After encouragement from her husband and community leaders she decided to try for a seat on the city council in 2009. â€œI felt qualified but not ready, if that makes sense,â€ Taylor said of her decision to run. â€œIt took some time for me to get used to the idea because I didnâ€™t think of myself as a politician but then I came to understand that elected office was an extension of my commitment to working with people in order to create a better future. â€ Taylor is one of only 19 big city mayors, according to a 2016 report by the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance of the 100 largest US cities. Of the top 15, only San Antonio has a female mayor. Experts and political groups involved in recruiting women to elective office say that having a female president  â€”   whoever she is  â€”   will open doors for women at every level of government, regardless of party. In some cases, even the prospect of a Clinton presidency has already helped. â€œIt is not a coincidence that we have a [high] number of Democratic women running in competitive Senate races in the same year we have Hillary Clinton at the top of the ticket,â€ according to Muthoni Wambu Kraal, the senior director for state and local campaigns at Emilyâ€™s List, which has been helping elect   women since 1985. â€œShe was a powerful recruitment tool. â€ ",726,665,"974733637823340545	974748980549705728	974769399310807040	974816759609004034	974973323930230784	975587913244205056	975695344204906498	975824342683615232	975906564878958593	975922792104263680	976322913782697985	976337806648856578	976431992089833472	977052344696352768	977198371004858369	1051139330947801088",fake

Itâ€™s a coffee shop with   wooden tables, plentiful sunlight from wide windows, and austere pendant lighting. Then head to Takk in Manchester. Itâ€™s a coffee shop with a big glass storefront, reclaimed wood furniture, and hanging Edison bulbs. Compare the two: You might not even know youâ€™re in different spaces. Itâ€™s no accident that these places look similar. Though theyâ€™re not part of a chain and donâ€™t have their interior design directed by a single corporate overlord, these coffee shops have a way of mimicking the same tired style, a hipster reduction obsessed with a superficial sense of history and the remnants of industrial machinery that once occupied the neighbourhoods they take over. And itâ€™s not just London and Manchester  â€”   this style is spreading across the world, from Bangkok to Beijing, Seoul to San Francisco. Itâ€™s not just coffee shops, either. Everywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of looking the same, whether itâ€™s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces. A coffee roaster resembles a WeWork office space. How can all that homogeneity possibly be cool? In an essay for the American tech website The Verge, I called this style â€œAirSpaceâ€. Itâ€™s marked by an easily recognisable mix of symbols  â€”   like reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting  â€”   thatâ€™s meant to provide familiar, comforting surroundings for a wealthy, mobile elite, who want to feel like theyâ€™re visiting somewhere â€œauthenticâ€ while they travel, but who actually just crave more of the same: more rustic interiors and   logos and splashes of cliche accent colours on rugs and walls. Hence the replicability: if a hip creative travels to Berlin or Tallinn, they seek out a place that looks like AirSpace, perhaps recommending it on Foursquare or posting a photo of it to Instagram to gain the approval of culturally savvy friends. Gradually, an entire AirSpace geography grows, in which you can travel all the way around the world and never leave it. You can hop from   bar to office space to apartment building, and be surrounded by those same AirSpace tropes I described above. Youâ€™ll be guaranteed fast internet, strong coffee, and a comfortable chair from which to do your telecommuting. What you wonâ€™t get is anything interesting or actually unique. There are several causes of AirSpace. The first is that mobility is increasing: more people move more quickly around the world than ever before, mostly passing through the same urban hotspots (London, New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong) and carrying their sense of style with them. Itâ€™s globalisation, but intensified, made more accessible to a wider economic spectrum of people, more of the time. Mobility is not just for the rich any more: working remotely is increasingly common you can take a sabbatical to work from Bali and not miss a beat. Taste is also becoming globalised, as more people around the world share their aesthetic aspirations on the same massive social media platforms, whether itâ€™s Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or Foursquare, with their hundreds of millions or billions of users. As algorithms shape which content we consume on our feeds, we all learn to desire the same things, which often happens to involve austere interiors, reclaimed wood, and Edison bulbs, like a metastasised   version of Kinfolk magazine or Monocle. Startups are also growing to provide these experiences of sameness as a product, predicated on the fact that we now prefer consuming   generic spaces to creating new ones of our own. Weâ€™ve been infantilised. The companies use technology to foster a sense of easy placelessness Roam, for example, is an international chain of   and working spaces that offers the same lifestyle (and same furniture) in Madrid, Miami and Ubud, and residents can live anywhere for Â£1, 500 per month. WeWorkâ€™s WeLive branch creates wan dormitories for mobile tech workers, each with its own   furniture and mandated   interior decorating. But the king of AirSpace is Airbnb. The platform enables users to travel seamlessly between places, staying in localsâ€™ apartments. Its slogan is â€œyou can belong anywhereâ€. But all Airbnbs have a way of looking like AirSpace, too  â€”   consultants who work with Airbnb hosts as well as the companyâ€™s own architects told me that a certain sameness is spreading, as users come to demand convenience and frictionlessness in lieu of meaningful engagement with a different place. Heading to yet another copycat coffee shop with your laptop isnâ€™t â€œlocalâ€. Why go anywhere if it just ends up looking the same as whatever global city you started from? Itâ€™s not just boring aesthetics, however. AirSpace creates a division between those who belong in the slick, interchangeable places and those who donâ€™t. The platforms that enable this geography are themselves biased: a Harvard Business School study showed that Airbnb hosts are less likely to accept guests with stereotypically   names. Thereâ€™s also the economic divide: access to AirSpace is expensive, whether itâ€™s a Â£3 cortado or the rent on a WeLive or Roam apartment. If you canâ€™t afford it, you are shut out. AirSpace is convenient, yes. It helps its occupants feel comfortable wherever they are, settled in amid recognisable reminders that they are relevant, interesting, mobile and global. You can change places within it with a single click, the same anonymous seamlessness of an airport lounge but distributed everywhere, behind the facades of local buildings that donâ€™t look like hotels, but act like them. Yet the discontent of this phenomenon is a creeping anxiety. Is everywhere really starting to look just the same? Glance around and you might be surprised. The next time you pick out a cafe or bar based on Yelp recommendations or Foursquare tips, or check into an Airbnb, each system driven by an audience of similar people, check if you see reclaimed wood furniture, industrial lighting, or a certain   minimalism.

Leicester City recovered from anger and disarray to salvage a draw that they celebrated like a victory.   down and destabilised by a sense of persecution following the   dismissal of Jamie Vardy and the award of a penalty against Danny Simpson, the champions stormed back and equalised with two minutes to go in normal time. The thrilling   victory over Manchester City last Saturday did not prove to be a turning point in their Premier League campaign, but maybe this will. What is certain is that Leicester will face disciplinary proceedings after they were shown six yellow cards in addition to Vardyâ€™s red and the most extraordinary sight on a wild afternoon was of Kasper Schmeichel ushering the normally placid Claudio Ranieri away from the referee, Craig Pawson, at  . The Italian said that his representations to Pawson  â€”   and his subsequent gestures to the Leicester fans  â€”   were intended to defuse tension or at least turn it into positive energy. The authorities will probably invite him to elaborate on that. Whatever appears on their rap sheet, Leicesterâ€™s away record remains awful. This was their second point on their travels this season, but the context in which it was gained could make it worth more. For a while they had seemed on course for a heavy beating and a   meltdown. Leicesterâ€™s woe began in the 28th minute when Vardy was sent off for a tackle on Mame Biram Diouf that Pawson deemed to be dangerous. The striker lifted both feet off the ground as he dived for the ball in his own half but he had landed by the time he connected with it. Pawson, who had been criticised in midweek for failing to punish Manchester Unitedâ€™s Marcos Rojo for a   lunge at Crystal Palaceâ€™s Wilfried Zaha, ruled it to have been reckless. There were suggestions that Vardy had been unbalanced by Glen Johnson as he went into the challenge, something the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, referred to. â€œPeople are trying to say he was pushed and thatâ€™s the reason he jumped in with two feet off the ground,â€ he said. â€œIt looked to me like he had two straight legs and out of control. â€œThere have been a couple of incidents like that where players have done similar and got away with yellows but those were deemed to be wrong, so the referee got it right. â€ Leicesterâ€™s rage intensified 11 minutes later when Stoke were given a penalty after a cross by Bojan Krkic hit the outstretched arm of Simpson as the defender, two yards away from the crosser, tried to make a block. Deliberate? No. Careless? Debatable. Krkic capitalised from the spot. Leicester lost their cool after that and it looked like they would be lucky to end the match with 10 players on the pitch. Three of their players were booked for dissent. To compound Leicesterâ€™s grievance, fortune turned against them. Stoke doubled their lead just before   when Johnson rolled a   to Giannelli Imbula, whose shot struck the inside of the post, bounced off Schmeichelâ€™s back and to the feet of Joe Allen, who stroked the ball into the empty net. Schmeichelâ€™s return to action after a     was supposed to herald an upturn in Leicesterâ€™s fortunes. The Dane had reinforced that theory by making a superb save from a shot by Jonathan Walters in the fifth minute. That was the trigger for    attacking in which Leicester gave as good as they got â€”   until the loss of Vardy. The England striker would have at least departed as a goalscorer if he had taken the chance given to him in the seventh minute by Marc Albrighton. But the striker hooked his lob wide. Lee Grant then had to make a save from a shot by Slimani, who forced him into another stop in the 23rd minute after nicking the ball off Ryan Shawcross. Two minutes later Grant intervened again, this time foiling Vardy after a cute   by Riyad Mahrez. Moments later Vardy jumped into the tackle on Diouf and was ordered off by Pawson. Then Leicester started to unravel. It seemed that the visitors composed themselves at   because they emerged with fresh focus. But balancing the scores would be tougher. Schmeichel had to make a fine save to prevent Stoke from going three up, tipping over a header by Jonathan Walters. Ranieriâ€™s next significant intervention was to make a double substitution in the 72nd minute and the new arrivals combined to revive hope for the champions. Demarai Gray delivered a cross from the right and Leonardo Ulloa sent a powerful header past Lee Grant. Ryan Shawcross thought he had cleared it off the line, but technology determined otherwise. Pawson, no doubt grateful for the help, awarded the goal. Two minutes from time, Leicesterâ€™s turnaround was complete as Christian Fuchs swung a ball into the box and Daniel Amartey powered a header into the net from eight yards.

The   Unilever, which owns Dove soap, Lynx body sprays and Ben  Jerryâ€™s ice cream, is on an acquisition spree buying up new and innovative companies that appeal to younger people to help maintain its stronghold on the global consumer goods market. The   of Honest, which the Golden     in 2011, comes hot on the heels of Unileverâ€™s $1bn purchase of Dollar Shave Club.  Both Unilever and Honest declined to comment on the proposed sale, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Honest, which has built up a loyal customer base of young mothers who buy its diapers (nappies) household cleaners and beauty products via online subscription, is also exploring the possibility of floating on the stock market.  The speculated $1bn sale price is significantly lower than the $1. 7bn Honest was reportedly valued at in its most recent fundraising drive last year.  Honest is attractive to Unilever for its â€œnaturalâ€ and â€œgreenâ€ household cleaning goods, which are a booming market in the US and overseas. But, Honest has been hit with   lawsuits by customers claiming that its products have been deceptively labeled as â€œorganicâ€ and â€œnaturalâ€ when they contain   ingredients. Alba, 35, who has been acting since she was 13 and starred in Fantastic Four and Dark Angel, has dismissed the lawsuits as baseless. â€œIf an organization wants to bring awareness to their cause, Iâ€™m an easy target and our brand is an easy target obviously, because I get a different kind of attention than other brands would,â€ she said on the Today show last month. â€œWe stand by our ingredients, the effectiveness of the products and weâ€™re pretty optimistic that weâ€™re going to win every case. â€ Paul Polman, Unileverâ€™s chief executive, said Unilever was seeking to buy up fresh ideas rather than attempting to come up with new products and business models in house. â€œAn innovative company has to go outside as much as inside. The main incubators for our future innovation capabilities are more likely to be outside than inside,â€ he said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. Polman, who was paid â‚¬10. 4m (Â£8. 9m) last year, described Dollar Shave Club  â€”   which has shaken up the razor market by posting grooming products to subscribers for as little as $1 a month  â€”   as a â€œdisruptorâ€.

politifact14832,http://usamirrornews.com/roy-moores-accuser-arrested-and-charged-with-falsification/,BREAKING: Roy Moore’s Accuser Arrested And Charged With Falsification,"The Canadian government has called for the release of a couple who have been held in captivity in northern Afghanistan for four years, after their captors released a video of the pair. The video, uploaded to YouTube on Monday, shows Canadian Joshua Boyle and American Caitlan Coleman and their two children, who were born in captivity, pleading with their governments to negotiate with their captors. Coleman described â€œthe Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselvesâ€ after being held in captivity since 2012, when they were kidnapped while backpacking in northern Afghanistan. The two are believed to be held by the Haqqani network, a terrorist group aligned with the Taliban, which has fought the Nato mission in Afghanistan and held the US soldier Bowe Bergdahl for five years.  Coleman called on Barack Obama and incoming president Donald Trump to work on securing their freedom. â€œWe have waited since 2012 for somebody to understand our problems,â€ she said, appearing to read from a script, while her husband sat next to her with their children rested on his lap. â€œWe can only ask and pray that somebody will recognize the atrocities these men carry out against us as   retaliation in their ingratitude and hypocrisy. â€ The video marks the first release from the couple since a video they put out in August, in which they warned their captors would kill them unless the Afghan government ended its execution of Taliban prisoners in Kabul. Michael Oâ€™Shaughnessy, spokesman for the Canadian Department of Global Affairs, told the Guardian that the Canadian government is aware of the new video. â€œWe are deeply concerned for the safety and wellbeing of Joshua Boyle, Caitlan Coleman and their young children and call for their unconditional release,â€ he said in a statement. The US state department did not respond to a request for comment. The couple were first abducted in 2012, while on a backpacking trip which started in Russia and took them through Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan. Coleman, who is from York County, Pennsylvania, was 28 years old at the time and pregnant with their first child. Both their children have been born in captivity.  In the video the couple refer to their two sons as their â€œsurviving childrenâ€ without explanation, indicating Coleman potentially miscarried.  Jim and Lyn Coleman, Caitlanâ€™s parents, received a letter from their daughter in November last year in which she notified them of the birth of her second child. The Colemans issued a plea on Circa News Network in July to top Taliban leaders to let their daughter,    and grandchildren go as an    show of mercy. Reuters confirmed the validity of the video with two senior Taliban figures based in Afghanistan. One of the officials said the Haqqani network delivered the video to Canadian and US officials before posting it online late on Monday night. He added that they were demanding the release of three senior members including the brother and maternal uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is deputy leader of the Afghan Taliban. The video was picked up by the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist groups. Coleman began the video by saying it was recorded on 3 December but this has yet to be verified.

The incident is the latest example of the social media platformâ€™s algorithms failing to distinguish between reliable and faulty news sources. Facebookâ€™s safety check tool, which allows users to mark themselves safe in the event of a disaster or crisis, was activated in Bangkok on 26 December, citing â€œmedia sourcesâ€ as confirmation of an explosion.  A Facebook spokesperson subsequently shared local media reports of a man protesting on a roof, throwing â€œping pong bombsâ€ or â€œgiant firecrackersâ€ in the direction of Government House, where the prime minister works. No one was injured, according to the Bangkok Post. Facebookâ€™s activation of the feature sowed confusion, however, because the platform also promoted a link to a false news report of a major â€œexplosionâ€. A screenshot of the feature shared by Saksith Saiyasombut, a local journalist, shows that Facebook promoted a 26 December article by BangkokInformer. com in conjunction with the safety check.  That article consisted of a link to 17 August 2015 BBC video about the bombing of the Erawan Shrine, according to a copy of the article preserved by the Internet Archive.  â€œNo, there was not a massive explosion Bangkok on Tuesday night,â€ wrote the local   newspaper Khaosod English in an article attempting to clarify the situation.  BangkokInformer. com is part of a network of local â€œnewsâ€ websites that appear to simply repost articles from other sources. The company did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.  Facebook defended its activation of the safety check feature.  â€œAs with all safety check activations, Facebook relies on a trusted third party to first confirm the incident and then on the community to use the tool and share with friends and family,â€ a spokesperson said in a statement.  When the safety check tool was launched in October 2014, it was only used for natural disasters. It was first used for a terrorist attack during the November 2015 Paris attacks. The company faced criticism, however, for its decision to activate the feature in some cases and not in others. In November, the company announced that it would no longer directly control the feature, instead relying on alerts of incidents from a â€œ  sourceâ€. The companyâ€™s explanation of the changes suggest that the feature is now controlled by algorithms detecting whether â€œpeople in the area are talking about the incidentâ€. The company declined to name its   source for incident reports. Facebook has faced considerable criticism over its role in the dissemination of false information, especially following the US presidential election, in which news hoaxes and partisan propaganda ran rampant on the site.  On 15 December, the company announced that it would begin working with   fact checkers to flag viral fake news stories. Five   organizations are participating in a pilot program to combat fake news on the platform, but the pilot is limited by the staff capability of the independent organizations.  The pilot also requires the   to address each false story individually  â€”   a challenge given that fake news stories can rapidly multiply across numerous websites. The BangkokInformer. com article, for example, was subsequently copied on to msn. com, creating another misleading headline featured on the safety check tool.  A Facebook spokeswoman, Anna White, pushed back against the idea that the tool was connected to the companyâ€™s fake news problem.  â€œSafety Check the product is in no way connected with any news articles  â€”   real or fake,â€ White told the Guardian by email. â€œPeople seeing that [the BangkokInformer. com article] at the end of the product flow may have gotten old information but that information did not trigger the activation in the first place like some outlets are reporting. â€ The false BangkokInformer. com article remains the top search result for Facebook users searching for â€œThailand explosionâ€. It has not been flagged as a fake news story by the independent fact checkers.

Itâ€™s the showâ€™s first time at the arena and its preparation and   has been a massive undertaking. It was three years ago when producers first started discussing the idea to house MTVâ€™s crown jewel at the â€œworldâ€™s most famous arenaâ€ and itâ€™s all about to coalesce on Sunday night when years of work result in a equally   and   spectacle. Well, thatâ€™s the plan. â€œSometimes you think the showâ€™s going to be one thing and then it turns into something else,â€ explains Garrett English, one of the executive producers of this yearâ€™s show, which sounds like code for: we donâ€™t know what is going to happen. Heâ€™s been working in some capacity with MTV and the Video Music Awards for the past two decades, and is well aware that things can quickly spin out of control.  â€œWe create a pretty volatile environment that can be combustable at times, and thatâ€™s part of what the showâ€™s about,â€ English says about expecting the unexpected, no doubt a major component of the VMAâ€™s allure, whether it was that famous kiss between Britney Spears and Madonna, or the infamous interruption of Taylor Swift by Kanye West. â€œThose are scary moments for a producer for sure, but itâ€™s something you canâ€™t manufacture. â€ Fortunately for English and producer Erik Flannigan, there are some things you can control. â€œOur lineup of who performs is always a fluid situation,â€ explains Flannigan, while the vast screen and lighting rig propped up on the stage behind him twinkles and flashes in preparation for this yearâ€™s scheduled moments, including ballyhooed VMA return of Britney Spears (her first since 2007) and an epic medley by pop superstar Rihanna. â€œI know whoâ€™s opening, but wonâ€™t say because thatâ€™s all part of the fun. But everything else always changes. Last year when Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj started the show together, that was something that we only planned a few days out. â€ Besides the showâ€™s musical moments, which are also poised to include rapper Future and a   Nick Jonas performance of his new single Bacon at an   undisclosed remote location, producers are also scurrying up a list of presenters, from comedians like former VMA host Jimmy Fallon to actors such as Ansel Elgort. There will be athletes in attendance as well, from Michael Phelps to the US womenâ€™s gymnastics team. â€œThe moment they won gold, we were like, â€˜We have to get them into the room,â€ says Flannigan of Olympians Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez, Madison Kocian and Aly Raisman. â€œI think theyâ€™re going to be the biggest celebrities there, I swear to God. Itâ€™s going to be Kim and Kanye wanting to take picture with the Olympians, not the other way around. â€ Speaking of West and his everlasting,   feud with Taylor Swift, the talk this year is also swirling about whoâ€™s not attending. While Yeezy himself will indeed be in the audience with wife Kim close by, all signs point to Swift skipping out on this yearâ€™s festivities entirely. Fellow superstar nominee Adele, in the midst of a world tour, also wonâ€™t be gracing the VMA stage. â€œSheâ€™s had some great moments with us, but it was never a conversation of no Adele versus having her,â€ says English. â€œFor a variety of reasons, it just didnâ€™t work. â€ However, one star which will be on full display wonâ€™t be any one artist, but the building itself. After bouncing between locations such as The Forum in Los Angeles and Brooklynâ€™s Barclays Center, the show lands at Madison Square Garden for the first time in its history. â€œWe arenâ€™t sure why it took so long,â€ says English, as comedy duo Key and Peele begin to rehearse a comedy sketch slated for the show on an elevated stage near the arenaâ€™s balcony. â€œThe Gardenâ€™s obviously been on our list for a while, but itâ€™s obviously a building thatâ€™s hard to get into, creatively and otherwise. â€ (MTV rented out the venue for 12 days, something a longtime security guard at the venue interjected was â€œvirtually unheard ofâ€.) â€œGetting here represents the pinnacle of an artistâ€™s career,â€ according to English. â€œWeâ€™ve always tried to figure out when was the right time for us to do that. The show has been in intimate environments and big rooms, and each year we try to reinvent what we do with it. â€ The reinvention of the spectacle on an annual basis is something thatâ€™s kept it fresh since the showâ€™s inaugural broadcast in 1984. (This yearâ€™s performer Ariana Grande was still nine years away from birth.) Back then, Dan Aykroyd and Bette Midler hosted and the Cars took home Video of the Year accolades for their track You Might Think, somehow beating Michael Jacksonâ€™s Thriller in what would be the first of many VMA upsets. â€œI think people enjoy watching because itâ€™s so rare to see talent behave like real people,â€ muses Flannigan as this yearâ€™s best new artist nominee Lukas Graham walks by flanked by his band. â€œPeople are drawn to the controversial parts, but I think theyâ€™re just as drawn to the moments of heart and artistic greatness. I think this Sunday will be much more about that stuff than it will be about whoâ€™s going to interrupt who. â€ â€¢ This article was amended on 29 August 2016 because an earlier version said, erroneously, that Taylor Swift had been nominated for Video of the Year.",217,787,"200100650758062080	201718450412994561	260398657482915840	260529646255341568	260696249991327744	260906345610498048	262006064705310720	262006159513366528	263367793968283648	263450974641868801	263453646304456705	263457303146160130	263515180489666560	264851387890933760	264852981504172033	264859123185762304	264894980731072514	264902085747826688	264908957116665856	265088564839198720	265148668129185792	265151531765096448	265312805438246913	265450269867925504	265501542096973825	265670991328456705	265796824491757568	265796827574595584	265796825997529089	265796831085223937	265910077247090689	265977329002635266	266265353632501760	267456860448231424	267487916996034560	267723388938776577	268685481020104704	271028873657999360	288533255131643904	304647777256886272	304649831819907072	367349955297423361	395562591759908864	395562817429831680	396034623123095552	402892727987081216	413803246239494144	413883403188965376	433659843464138752	525387666519756800	634200338950684677	634376046352179200	634390599597080576	634398069702922243	634467180164182016	634528298517839873	634750365255245824	696842586674241536	762806120847204352	790963751302332416	930087336179744768	1040658874741780482	1058144898795356160	1058490883379810307",fake
politifact13468,http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37987306?ocid=socialflow_twitter,Denzel Washington hit by Facebook fake news story on Trump,"Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte has told Barack Obama â€œyou can go to hellâ€ in his strongest tirade so far against the US over its criticism of his deadly   campaign, adding that he may eventually decide to â€œbreak up with Americaâ€. He also lashed out anew at the European Union, saying the bloc, which has also criticized his brutal crackdown, â€œbetter choose purgatory, hell is filled upâ€. Since becoming president in June, Duterte has had an uneasy relationship with the US and with Obama and has declared intentions to bolster relations with China and Russia as he revamps Philippine foreign policy that has long leaned on Washington. The   leader also has been hypersensitive to criticism over his   crackdown, which has left more than an estimated 3, 000 suspected drug dealers and pushers dead in just three months, alarming the United Nations, the EU, the US and human rights watchdogs. In a speech before a local convention attended by officials and business executives, Duterte outlined his disappointments with the US, which has asked his government to stop the widespread killings and has questioned whether human rights are being violated. He also described Washington as an unreliable ally, saying Filipino forces had not benefited from joint combat exercises with US troops. â€œInstead of helping us, the first to criticize is this state department, so you can go to hell, Mr Obama, you can go to hell,â€ Duterte said. Then addressing the EU, he said: â€œBetter choose purgatory, hell is filled up. â€ In a later speech at a synagogue in Makati city in the Manila metropolis, Duterte warned he may decide to â€œbreak up with Americaâ€ in his most serious threat so far to push relations back with Washington. â€œEventually I might, in my time, I will break up with America,â€ he said without elaborating. â€œI would rather go to Russia and to China. â€ In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday the US had not received any official request from Duterte or any other Philippine official to alter any aspect of bilateral cooperation. â€œThis is an alliance that is robust and that benefits both of our countries,â€ Earnest said. â€œEven as we protect this strong alliance, the administration and the United States of America will not hesitate to raise our concerns about extrajudicial killings. We remain deeply concerned by reports of widespread extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities in the Philippines. The use of that kind of tactic is entirely inconsistent with universal human rights and the shared values of our two countries. â€ Duterte has given assurances that he will not abrogate a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty with the US and will maintain the long alliance with America, one of his countryâ€™s largest trading partners and provider of development and military aid and defense equipment. The US has expressed concern over the killings and urged Duterteâ€™s government to ensure law enforcement efforts comply with human rights obligations. Last month, Obama canceled a planned first meeting with Duterte on the sidelines of an Asian summit in Laos after the Filipino leader blurted â€œson of a bitchâ€ in warning the US leader not to lecture him on human rights ahead of their meeting. Duterte later expressed regrets over his remarks. Angered by US criticism, Duterte has made a series of public pronouncements that he could scale back the activities and presence of visiting US troops in the country. Last week, Duterte said the joint   combat exercises to be held this week, the first of his presidency, would also be the last of his tenure. The exercises, centering on amphibious landing drills, started Tuesday under some uncertainty because of those remarks. Marine commanders from both sides said at the opening ceremony that the exercises, involving 1, 100 American and 400 Filipino military personnel, were aimed at improving readiness by the two countries to respond to a range of crises while deepening their historic ties. US embassy officials said Washington had not been formally notified by the Philippine government of any move to scrap other planned drills. Such a move by the Philippines would impede Washingtonâ€™s plans to expand the footprint of US forces in   Asia to counter China. A Philippine military spokesman for the exercises, Capt Ryan Lacuesta, sidestepped the question of whether Duterteâ€™s remarks had affected the troops and the atmosphere of the drills. US Marine Brig Gen John Jansen said that aside from promoting regional security, the exercises had helped save lives in terms of fostering more rapid and organized responses to disasters like Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. â€œOur alliance remains a key source of stability in the   region,â€ Jansen said, expressing confidence â€œthat we will continue to build our partnership and capabilities

Flowers herself appeared to confirm the report on Saturday, writing on Twitter: â€œHi Donald. You know Iâ€™m in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!â€  Nine years earlier, however, Flowers said she would support Hillary Clinton in her first presidential campaign. Speaking in 2007, Flowers said: â€œI canâ€™t help but want to support my own gender. â€ She added: â€œI donâ€™t have any interest whatsoever in getting back out there and bashing Hillary Clinton. â€ Her reported invitation to watch Trump do so in 2016 appeared to have its roots in a feud between the Republican candidate and Mark Cuban, a politically outspoken billionaire who has questioned Trumpâ€™s boasted worth. On Thursday, Cuban tweeted that he had â€œjust got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the â€˜Humbling at Hofstraâ€™ on Monday. It Is On!â€ On Saturday morning, Trump replied: â€œIf dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!â€ BuzzFeed News then reported that Judy Stell, an assistant to Flowers, said in an email that though Flowers had previously declined invitations to public events because she did not want to be a sideshow, â€œMs Flowers has agreed to join Donald at the debateâ€. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for confirmation. Clinton was reportedly spending the weekend preparing for Mondayâ€™s debate, which will be held at Hofstra University in New York. Trump was scheduled to address a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, on Saturday evening. The New York Times reported that Clintonâ€™s preparations include a staffer, Philippe Reines, playing Trump and pursuing expected lines of attack including Bill Clintonâ€™s sexual indiscretions. Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Trump said that out of â€œrespectâ€ for Clinton he would not be â€œlookingâ€ to pursue such attacks. â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do exactly,â€ he said. â€œIt depends on what level she hits you with, if sheâ€™s fair, if itâ€™s unfair, but certainly Iâ€™m not looking to do that. â€ Flowers came to national prominence in January 1992, when Bill Clinton first campaigned for the White House, with an allegation of a   affair and tapes of conversations between the two.  Clinton initially denied the claim, but admitted in a 1998 deposition in a sexual harassment suit that he had had a single sexual encounter with Flowers.

politifact13929,https://web.archive.org/web/20170310212116/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-nancy-pelosi-was-just-taken-from-her-office-in-handcuffs/,BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi Was Just Taken From Her Office In Handcuffs,"The arrival of a new Terrence Malick film is always something of an event, even if the great manâ€™s lustre is beginning to wear off under the weight of his gigantic reputation: even the most diehard Malick obsessives would surely admit that the fey, whispery To the Wonder and the   Knight of Cups were not really up to scratch. Compared to how he used to, Malick works at a virtual sprint these days, and now his   documentary Voyage of Time has been unveiled at the Venice film festival. Intriguingly, for such a   auteur, Voyage of Time is being issued in two different versions, at two different running times: the one Venice is presenting is a   edit, subtitled Lifeâ€™s Journey, with a voiceover provided by Cate Blanchett. Also floating around is one half its length, intended for the   Imax cinemas, with Blanchett replaced by Brad Pitt. (According to Malickâ€™s own notes, Pittâ€™s voiceover is â€œmore awestruck and explanatoryâ€ weâ€™ll just have to wait and see exactly what that means.) Moreover, slightly more advance information has been available about Voyage of Time than is usual for project from the famously secretive director partly, at least, because Malick got himself ensnared in some unwelcome litigation after an unhappy backer claimed he â€œforgotâ€ about it. (The case has now been settled.) Malickâ€™s stated ambition is to describe the â€œscientific chronology of Earthâ€  â€”   to, in effect, chronicle the development of our universe and planet at macro and micro levels  â€”   and, given that the contents of his own mind have increasingly preoccupied Malickâ€™s creative imagination, it is I suppose a logical development for him to produce a film with no actors, and any human input in front of the camera kept to an absolute minimum. The first point to make is that, for this   version at any rate, anyone expecting a brisk, informative science lesson  â€”   along the lines, say, of that rather handy little film that explained how they cloned dinosaurs in Jurassic Park  â€”   will be disappointed. Malick has provided a dazzling flow of quite astonishing images, but provided little in the way of context Blanchettâ€™s voiceover, hardly there in any case, is very much on the incantatory, putatively poetic lines for which the director clearly has a weakness. (In all honesty, if it was stripped out entirely, I doubt it would make a great deal of difference to the filmâ€™s impact.) Everything comes in a heady rush so much so itâ€™s difficult to process what exactly we are seeing. Vast galactic spaces, filled with churning cosmic matter, give way to pristine earthbound landscapes great care is taken to focus on the flow and change and transformation of what is being filmed. Malick then swoops even further in, down to microscopic and even subatomic levels: microbes, cells, and smaller particles all float by in their   glory. Whatâ€™s particularly remarkable is that there is little difference in the brilliant image quality between the intense,   footage of natural phenomena, and the superbly rendered CGI that has been employed for the sections for which the   must rely on their own imaginations: star collapses, expanding galaxies, and the like. Without any contextual information, itâ€™s down to the audience to pick up on Malickâ€™s cues as to the sense of the development of geological time: some are more obvious than others, such as the arrival of a giant asteroid shortly after we get a look at a   CGI dinosaur (who, for obvious reasons, never reappears). Humans arenâ€™t shut out entirely in the filmâ€™s final third we are invited to watch a group of (suspiciously  ) early humans, who pass through stages of hunting,   and family life, as well as the apparent development of ritual and spirituality. Malick also intersperses his glorious natural imagery throughout with scrappy bits of   video footage of contemporary human activity across the globe  â€”   largely, but not entirely, in cramped urban spaces. Itâ€™s quite a contrast. In this version, then, Voyage of Time is perhaps best appreciated as an abstract, with its sheer profusion of natural beauty and consequent synchronicities of image. Itâ€™s not entirely without precedent  â€”   the Koyaanisqatsi films by Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke had something of a similar aesthetic ambition, though with very different ends in mind, and the Eamesâ€™ famous short, Powers of Ten, contains a little of the same dizzying sense of scale, though in exquisite miniature. Voyage of Time, in the end, is a perhaps an aesthetic experience rather than an particularly informative one, prizing images over data but what images they are.

politifact14286,https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142109/http://stgeorgegazette.com:80/trump-plans-to-resign-within-30-days,Paul Ryan: “Donald Trump Plans To Resign From Office Within The Next 30 Days”,"Summer is a tough time to get paying museumgoers through the doors  â€”   but this year, thereâ€™s an extra incentive. Art museums like the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art in New York are jumping on the PokÃ©mon Go bandwagon and helping players of the augmented reality game â€œcatch â€™em allâ€. Just as local businesses have jumped on the bandwagon to get new customers, museums are jumping on board to attract young players and boost ticket sales from Los Angeles to New York, Texas and Boston. PokÃ©mon Go, the mobile app released earlier this month, boasts 26 million daily active players in the US alone. The game, which has generated over $14m and is available in 25 other countries, allows players to catch cartoon monsters on their smartphones, using the real world as a backdrop for the augmented reality game. Gamers are out pounding the pavement through a   map, but itâ€™s not without controversy  â€”   players have walked off cliffs, found dead bodies and caused a stampede at Central Park. â€œPokÃ©stopsâ€ are places where gamers catch characters and gain points. Several of these checkpoints are now at museums. The MoMA has two PokÃ©stops, including one right at the front gates, showing that some players need not enter the museum to play the game. However, other characters are waiting inside the galleries at the current Tony Oursler and Rachel Harrison exhibitions. At the Philadelphia Museum of Art, there are eight PokÃ©stops around the building. The museum is â€œdevoted to the idea of creative playâ€ according to its associate director of digital marketing, Chessia Kelley, who helped create a PokÃ©mon   during the museumâ€™s â€œpay what you wishâ€ hours. Apparently, the decision wasnâ€™t meant to drive sales  â€”   rather to â€œattract visitors during an accessible   when users are encouraged to casually browse the galleriesâ€ said Kelley. The numbers show an improvement: attendance during the   was up 13% from the previous week, 25% from this time last year and 37% higher than the average during the first quarter of last year . But itâ€™s easy to spot the difference between thoughtful museumgoers and hungry gamers hunting for PokÃ©stops  â€”   who could otherwise be perceived as zombies with smartphones mindlessly trailing through the corridors with screen tunnel vision. In other words, is the art merely a backdrop, seen only through a handheld device? â€œMany gathered in the galleries where PokÃ©stops were baited and spent several minutes there waiting to see what they could collect before moving to the next stop,â€ said Kelley. Instead of just planting gamer bait around art, other museums are motivated by different reasons to partake in the craze. The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Delray Beach, Florida, jumped on the bandwagon because of the cultural connection, as PokÃ©mon was created by the Japanese game designer Satoshi Tajiri in 1995. â€œWe felt we had a direct cultural connection to the Japanese franchise,â€ said Monika Amar, who works in marketing at the museum, which has 15 PokÃ©stops. â€œOur attendance has spiked in the days since the application was first released,â€ said Amar. â€œWeâ€™ve found that once people come to play PokÃ©mon Go, they return to experience the museum and gardens and for the opportunity to â€˜catch â€™em allâ€™ in a picturesque landscape. â€ But it isnâ€™t all so Zen. On the Morikami fanpage, people posted photos of their vandalized garden. Some PokÃ©mon Go users carved their team names into trees  â€”   one reading â€œTeam Instinct Rocksâ€  â€”   and were caught climbing trees. That angered one museumgoer with an annual membership to the Morikami gardens, Kandi Kalistar. â€œIâ€™m so appalled my serene quiet place is marked up by idiots chasing PokÃ©mon,â€ said Kalistar in one of her YouTube videos. â€œIâ€™m disgusted by the lack of courtesy of these kids, but itâ€™s not only kids. Have respect for the environment around you. â€ The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington also asked the game developers Niantic Labs to remove the PokÃ©stops from the museum when staff realised that some users would be tempted to play the game there. â€œPlaying PokÃ©mon Go in a memorial dedicated to the victims of Nazism is extremely inappropriate,â€ said Andrew Hollinger, the museumâ€™s communications director. â€œThe museum encourages visitors to use their phones to share and engage with museum content while here. Technology can be an important learning tool, but this game falls far outside of our educational and memorial mission. â€ For the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, the game is a better fit. â€œWeâ€™re hopeful that PokÃ©mon Go will attract these young visitors, while helping promote free admission for 19 and under,â€ said Julie Ledet, the museumâ€™s communications officer. â€œWe are definitely considering the possibilities of what kind of engagement this could create with new visitors and definitely a younger generation of museumgoers. â€ Some characters are hidden in the museumâ€™s courtyard, while others are situated by famous artworks by Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet. â€œPokÃ©stops are historical and cultural markers,â€ Ledet said. â€œThey give players an extra incentive to visit these spaces. â€ However, PokÃ©stops are now the most popular visiting spots in the museum, meaning that other artworks may lose out. Kiki Smithâ€™s Woman and Sheep marks one of the eight PokÃ©stops on museum grounds. â€œWe have a fun joke running on the museumâ€™s Snapchat that the Auguste Rodin sculpture Head of Pierre de Wissant is bummed that he wasnâ€™t selected as a PokÃ©stop, too,â€ she said.",516,988,"878238320047923200	878801295259430912	878954942098223104	879295687342665728	879322199814963200	879338034902126592	879404470525988864	879429324763533313	879431978709331968	879436406203887616	879581268450529280	879581476152422400	879775738425102337	879791689979842561	879818174052446208	879822716248899584	880046716703174656	880144328068354049	880178910138216448	880189230600802304	880242119117615104	880255443704197121	880740583626637314	883253669877211136	883281364405104640	884982632450326528	884984109109522432	884990376028721152	899062845593206785",fake

Itâ€™s about seeing what we can learn from and about them. In the Donald Trump era, itâ€™s also about observing the contradictions in the incoherent coalition that elected him, and between that coalition and whatâ€™s left of the Republican establishment. Here are five pieces by conservative outlets and authors to read this week. Publication: The American Conservative, Who wrote it? Andrew Bacevich, a   conservative critic of neoconservatives, the military and Americaâ€™s endless wars. Heâ€™s got the credentials to do it  â€”   Bacevich has had stints as a military officer and a professor of history at Boston College.  Why you should read it: Bacevich offers sweeping remedies for draining the   swamp, but in the end he doubts that Trump will have the stomach for it, whatever candidate Trump may have promised. This is the   look yet at the disappointments likely to be awaiting the â€œAmerica firstâ€ right.  Extract:  All signs indicate that, in one fashion or another, our combative next president will perpetuate the wars heâ€™s inheriting. Trump may fancy that, as a veteran of Celebrity Apprentice (but not of military service) he possesses a special knack for spotting the next Grant or Sherman. But acting on that impulse will merely replenish the swamp in the Greater Middle East along with the one in Washington. And soon enough, those who elected him with expectations of seeing the   establishment dismantled will realize that theyâ€™ve been had. Publication: The Huffington Post, Who wrote it? Bonnie Kristian, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a thinktank set up by Rand Paul and the Koch Brothers to argue a position incorporating â€œgreater reluctance to assert military force or even impose sanctionsâ€ on traditional US enemies like Iran and North Korea. Why you should read it: Again, we see   voices on the right trying to hold Trump to his campaign commitment to eschew overseas â€œ â€ in the interests of making America great again. Trumpâ€™s moves since the election might make us wonder how serious any of his campaign rhetoric was, and whether he can hold his unique coalition together with the generals in his ear. Extract: Trump finds himself in the uphill battle of the century, as the Washington foreign policy establishment will fight tooth and nail to maintain the status quo of   intervention, escalation, and stagnation. Just one day before Trump held his Ohio rally, for example, Gen. Joseph Votel of US Central Command told a mostly neoconservative audience that the United States must keep a significant number of troops in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future to send a â€˜strong messageâ€™. Publication: The Los Angeles Times, Who wrote it? Legal   David Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley together, they were the architects of the   suit against Obamacare which commenced in 2010.  Why you should read it: If you want to know how conservative lawyers are planning to help out the Trump administration, this is a good place to start. Even as new sanctuary cities emerge to protect undocumented migrants from federal agencies, conservatives are preparing the legal arguments that might allow the Trump administration to shut them down. Liberal legal scholars will have ready responses to Rivkin and Foleyâ€™s brash claims. But this article might leave the rest of us pondering. Extract:  It follows that, consistent with the   doctrine, Congress can require state, local or university police to tell federal agents when they arrest an immigrant present in the country illegally. Publication: Financial Times, Who wrote it? Senator John McCain, a veteran Republican leader, who has an infamously rocky relationship with Donald Trump. He won   as senator for Arizona this year despite being consistently singled out by conservative Republicans as an avatar of the GOP establishment. Why you should read it: This defense of free trade, and promotion of the   TPP as a geopolitical tool would have been unremarkable six months ago. Now, itâ€™s a sign that there are Republicans still prepared to disagree with the   on trade and foreign policy  â€”   in the forums of the global elite. It also suggests that on some issues he may struggle to marshall a finely balanced Senate. (  GOP senators like Rand Paul are promising to be just as unruly). Extract:  Politics abhors a vacuum and Asian countries will gravitate towards China if US influence is perceived as declining. Rumours of the next administrationâ€™s intention to reduce the US military presence in Asia are shaping that perception, too, to Chinaâ€™s advantage. Publication: Wall Street Journal, Who wrote it? William A Galston, a columnist for WSJ and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Why you should read it: Liberal internationalism is on the wane, even among the people who used to be its biggest promoters. The establishment  â€”   even ostensible liberals  â€”   are accommodating themselves to the wave of populist nationalism. Read it if you want to see how elites are â€œnormalisingâ€ Trumpism, and if you want to understand why we wonâ€™t be getting any help from centrists whose main concern is amassing power. Extract:  The axis of politics shifts when dissenting views enter the mainstream. On populist issues such as trade, immigration and national sovereignty, this process is visibly under way.",24,480,"930586214494801920	930586741286817797	930586867728355328	930587784066281472	930587888663891969	930588544665554944	930588654854053889	930588658507362304	930588855836860417	930589425901465601	930589558751809536	930590272731299840	930590756401795072	930591190428217344	930591364072472576	930592210680127489	930593380526157824	930594663928606720	930595758528782336	930595767642927105	930595838409273345	930595897427349504	930595918600196097	930596228995395585	930596648320946176	930596784518434816	930597622791929856	930598136292265984	930598650232868864	930600380626378752	930600744419459073	930600792674926592	930601062314266624	930601480591233024	930602809132711936	930603318417809409	930603614791393280	930605192273383424	930605817425883136	930607030976397312	930607171661910017	930607331053842432	930607915014160384	930608817246736384	930608944472567808	930609121782575104	930609357556940800	930611402988953600	930611780702932992	930612247549714437	930613122779549696	930613714092527616	930613787341852672	930614082599837698	930614225461903360	930614391518695424	930616065943592961	930618766182043649	930619471538012160	930620128567414784	930620536509607937	930620609658347523	930625853771395073	930627008555634688	930629271265206272	930630122750832641	930631468572971010	930631945209499648	930634904907399168	930643103362506752	930644346579320832	930647835074232320	930647932013072384	930657324137680896	930659235356135425	930660726020157441	930664110987055104	930696073630404610	930701627379634181	930718503094460416	930720531988430848	930732858439880705	930766493330968577	930774287417593857	930784765803819008	930789028869365761	930801616248242176	930812473535533058	930819971260788737	930822293844119553	930840501720420352	930847719303925760	930848823815139328	930969580469592064	931006772093087744	931068144189362176	931248296231952389	931349632738832384	931475545916878848	931616137246261248	932944938345656320	934987935140560897	1017883988831195137",fake
politifact15475,https://www.viralwdc.site/national-guard-storms-mexico-border-makes-game-changing-impact-in-just-30-days/,"National Guard Storms Mexico Border, Makes Game-Changing Impact In Just 30 Days","A Minnesota police officer has been charged with   manslaughter in the killing of Philando Castile, an African American who was fatally shot in a suburb of St Paul, Minnesota, in July. Ramsey County attorney John Choi announced the manslaughter charge and two other felony charges on Wednesday, more than four months after Castile, 32, was killed. St Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez will have his first court appearance on Friday, Choi said. Yanez was also charged with two counts of felony discharge of a firearm. The maximum sentence for the   manslaughter charge is 10 years and a $20, 000 fine. Castileâ€™s death was among a number of police killings of black Americans that spurred protests and led to calls for police reforms across the country. The aftermath of the shooting was   on Facebook by his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. The video, which did not capture the shooting itself, quickly went viral amid a contentious nationwide conversation about police use of deadly force. Choi did not release the dashboard camera footage which captured the entire shooting, but recounted in great detail the dialogue and events preceding Castileâ€™s death. He described a compliant and   motorist who calmly informed Yanez that he was armed with a concealed weapon before Yanez pulled the trigger.  Yanez suspected Castile of being involved in a nearby robbery involving two black men he radioed another officer saying that the occupants of the car  â€”   Castile, Reynolds, and Reynoldsâ€™    daughter  â€”   â€œjust look like the people that were involved in a robberyâ€ according to the criminal complaint. Yanez continued: â€œThe driver looks more like one of our suspects just because of the   nose. â€ Yanez ran Castileâ€™s license plate and found that the car was not stolen and that Castile was not wanted on any warrants, but decided to pull over Castile because of a broken tail light, Choi said. Castile â€œimmediately compliedâ€ when Yanez initiated the traffic stop, pulling over his car just eight seconds after Yanez turned on his lights, according to Choi. Yanez then informed Castile about his broken tail light, and asked for his driverâ€™s license and proof of insurance. Castile gave his insurance card. Choi then recounted the final moments of Castileâ€™s life: â€œCalmly and in a   manner, [Castile] informed Officer Yanez, â€˜Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me. â€™â€  According to the prosecutorâ€™s account, Yanez initially replied â€œOK,â€ while placing his hand on his own holstered gun. Yanez interrupted as Castile tried to respond, saying â€œdonâ€™t pull it outâ€ multiple times in a brief exchange before shooting Castile seven times, about one minute after the traffic stop began, Choi said. Castile muttered his final words  â€”   â€œI wasnâ€™t reaching for itâ€  â€”   as Yanez continued to scream at him: â€œDonâ€™t pull it out!â€  â€œBased upon the evidence we believe that Castile never removed nor tried to remove his handgun from his front, right pocket,â€ Choi said on Wednesday. â€œI would submit that no reasonable officer knowing, seeing and hearing what Officer Yanez did at the time would have used deadly force under these circumstances. â€ Choi noted that another officer at the scene, who was standing by the passenger side window during the traffic stop, did not unholster or fire his gun. Yanezâ€™s attorney has previously said that Yanez opened fire in response to â€œthe presence of that gun and the display of that gunâ€ although prosecutors said on Wednesday the gun was never displayed. Paramedics found Castileâ€™s gun in his shorts pocket, Choi said. In his wallet were his driverâ€™s license and his permit to carry a concealed weapon. An attorney for Yanez, who is Latino, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",955,635,"996065847688024070	996066270666731520	996067873012502529	996067920689225729	996069192309919744	996070089609961477	996070354014605312	996070369386610688	996070714678558722	996072729005645824	996072911776645122	996073006949634048	996078085702406144	996078529115705344	996080240035233792	996080777556299777	996088696549068800	996088806750195712	996089302579843074	996091712878600192	996105057312673793	996106181335814145	996171949079453696	996186228776210432	996191250024927232	996205916553957377	996224450126401536	996234103358935040	996383621295550465	996741500997373952	997619625360875521	998299958737604609	998341351354679296	998393604841312257	998560026477330432	998856329979744256	999615272880394241	1002010983710130176	1002350653396672518	1007769168509263872	1032083307184435200	1033158954392666113",fake

politifact15494,http://flashnewss.club/breaking-shep-smith-to-be-canned-because-he-cant-control-his-hate-for-donald-trump/,BREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Can’t Control His Hate For Donald Trump,"Carrie Fisher, the actor best known for her portrayal of Princess Leia in the Star Wars films and her unflinching   that contrasted with the artifice of Hollywood celebrity, has died in Los Angeles. She was 60 years old.  Her death came days after she was reported to have suffered a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles last Friday. The news was confirmed in a statement released on behalf of her daughter, Billie Lourd, who said Fisher was â€œloved by the worldâ€ and â€œwill be profoundly missedâ€. Fisherâ€™s career was characterized by her willingness to acknowledge, challenge and satirize the stereotypes of her upbringing and privilege. As the daughter of two Hollywood stars, Debbie Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher, she brought awareness and humor to her work, whether in film or in numerous books that tracked and reviewed her fortunes in life  â€”   or what she herself had termed â€œwhat itâ€™s like to live an    lifeâ€. Paying tribute to her daughter, her mother described her as â€œamazingâ€. Reynolds, 84, wrote on Facebook: â€œThank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter. I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Motherâ€. Fisherâ€™s Star Wars   Harrison Ford, 74, said in a statement: â€œCarrie was     . .. brilliant, original. Funny and emotionally fearless. She lived her life, bravely. My thoughts are with her daughter Billie, her mother Debbie, her brother Todd and her many friends. We will all miss her. â€ Among the first to react to her death was Mark Hamill, who starred as Luke Skywalker alongside Fisher in the Star Wars films. He tweeted â€œno words #Devastatedâ€ and a photograph of them together in character. Earlier, announcing Fisherâ€™s death in Los Angeles, Billie Lourdâ€™s publicist said: â€œIt is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8. 55 this morning. She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly. Our entire family thanks you for your thoughts and prayers. â€She had experienced medical trouble during a flight from London on Friday and was treated by paramedics immediately after the plane landed in Los Angeles, according to reports. The celebrity website TMZ, which first reported Fisher was unwell, had cited anonymous sources claiming the actor suffered a heart attack.  Todd Fisher, her brother, said over the weekend that many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency were unknown. â€œWe have to wait and be patient,â€ he said. â€œWe have so little information ourselves. â€ Fisher had shot to stardom in 1977 upon the release of the original Star Wars, a movie that changed Hollywood and a franchise that continues to captivate new audiences around the world. She revisited the role as the leader of a galactic rebellion in sequels, including last yearâ€™s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Fisher was also celebrated for her comedic accounts, sometimes   of life in the celebrity fishbowl of Hollywood and her personal struggles. Her screenplay Postcards from the Edge, which dealt candidly with issues of mental health and addiction, was adapted into a 1990 film starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep. More books followed, including Delusions of Grandma, Surrender the Pink, The Best Awful, Shockaholic and this yearâ€™s autobiography, The Princess Diarist. Earlier this year, Fisher was honored by an association at Harvard, which awarded her its annual outstanding lifetime achievement award in cultural humanism in recognition of her â€œbravely honestâ€ literary career. Ever ready to satirize herself, she has even played â€œCarrie Fisherâ€ a few times, as in David Cronenbergâ€™s dark Hollywood sendup Maps to the Stars and in an episode of Sex and the City. In the past 15 years, Fisher also had a somewhat prolific career as a television guest star, recently in the Amazon show Catastrophe, as the mother of Rob Delaneyâ€™s lead, and perhaps most memorably as a   comedy legend on 30 Rock. Her   show, Wishful Drinking, which she performed on and off across the country beginning in 2006, was turned into a book, made its way to Broadway in 2009 and was captured for HBO in 2010. Little was   in the show. She discussed the scandal that engulfed her superstar parents (her father ran off with film star Elizabeth Taylor) her brief marriage to the singer Paul Simon the time the father of her daughter left her for a man and the day she woke up next to the dead body of a platonic friend who had overdosed in her bed. â€œIâ€™m a product of Hollywood inbreeding. When two celebrities mate, something like me is the result,â€ she said in the show. At another point, she cracked: â€œI donâ€™t have a problem with drugs so much as I have a problem with sobriety. â€œPeople relate to aspects of my stories, and thatâ€™s nice for me because then Iâ€™m not all alone with it,â€ she said. â€œAlso, I do believe youâ€™re only as sick as your secrets. If thatâ€™s true, Iâ€™m just really healthy. â€ Fisherâ€™s own romantic life was characterized by drama. Her marriage to Simon in the early 80s ended after 11 months. She later married the Hollywood agent Bryan Lourd. They had a daughter, Billie. That union ended with Lourd leaving Fisher for a man. â€œI turn people gay. Thatâ€™s what I do. It is an unusual superpower,â€ she told the Baltimore Sun in 2012. Her latest book, The Princess Diarist, was   and made news when she disclosed that she and Ford had had an affair on the set of Star Wars. She told People magazine: â€œIt was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend. â€ Fisher had bipolar disorder for which she received electroshock therapy. She   confessed to a love of LSD and her compulsions led to addictions to cocaine and painkillers. Fisher had also recently started writing an advice column published in the Guardian. One reader wrote to her seeking advice for dealing with bipolar disorder. Fisher commended the reader for asking for help and said: â€œYou reached out to me  â€”   that took courage. Now build on that. â€ Fisher was born in Beverly Hills, California, in 1956, to her Hollywood royalty parents. When Fisher was two years old, her father left the family for Taylor, the widow of her fatherâ€™s best friend, Mike Todd. The following year, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a shoe store chain. Fisher made her film debut in the 1975 comedy Shampoo, starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn. Two years later she was picked to play Princess Leia in Star Wars. Other roles followed, but none came close to matching the attention she received for the   series.

politifact14309,https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/,"3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes","The battle scenes of Shakespeareâ€™s Henry V may have been written to suit the long, narrow stage of the Curtain, one of the earliest   theatres in London. The foundations of the theatre in Shoreditch have been excavated, revealing that it was a rectangular building with a stage about 14 metres long and five metres deep  â€”   a different shape from the â€œwooden Osâ€ of Shakespeareâ€™s more famous theatres on the South Bank, the Globe and the Rose. Archaeologists have discovered traces of a tunnel structure, accessed by doors on either end of the stage, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience.  â€œThe question now is whether Shakespeare and other playwrights were writing plays specifically for this kind of stage  â€”   which would have required a completely different style of interaction compared to a thrust stage with the audience on three sides,â€ said Heather Knight, a senior archaeologist from the Museum of London Archaeology, which excavated the site and has years more research to do on the finds. â€œDid it mean that it needed a different style of acting, for instance, or that you could get more people on the stage, and so you could put in many more characters?â€ Shakespeare is known to have acted at the Curtain, whose name came not from a stage curtain but from Curtain Road, which flanked a medieval monastery. The theatre was very poorly documented, but one of the few recorded facts is that the playwright was listed as an actor in the first performance of Ben Jonsonâ€™s Every Man in His Humour, in 1598.  It is believed to be where Henry V was first performed, and Romeo and Juliet is also thought to have been staged there. The historian Julian Bowsher believes that the famous prologue to Henry V, describing a theatre as round  â€”   â€œwithin this wooden Oâ€  â€”   was added for later performances when the company moved across the river to the South Bank. The theatre initially baffled the archaeologists. Its existence was marked by a metal plaque more than a century ago, but the exact site was unknown and in the only contemporary drawing of it it was shown as round. However, having excavated down to a layer of rubble, probably from the demolished monastery, levelled up with a layer of gravel across the entire site, Knightâ€™s team is certain it was a   rectangular structure, with the   stage in brick, a yard for the groundlings paying only a penny for their entertainment, and three sides of timber galleries for the better off.  It was constructed in what had been the back garden of a building on Curtain Road, and remains of green glazed pottery money boxes for the entry fees, which kept the takings safe since the cash could only extracted by smashing them, prove that it was built for paying customers. Other finds included a comb, glass beads and pins that may have come from costumes, a clay pipe found under the stage, a broken figure of Bacchus astride a wine barrel  â€”   a fitting god for a rowdy area full of taverns  â€”   and an egg   clay vessel believed to be a bird call, possibly used for stage effects. The design of a Â£750m complex of offices, shops and apartments on the site, christened the Stage, has been changed to preserve the archaeology, which will eventually be on display with the finds in a visitor centre, planned to open in 2019. The developers have also launched a poetry competition for a sonnet or a limerick linked to Shakespeare or Shoreditch, to be judged by the historian Michael Wood and Prof Stanley Wells, the chair of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.",359,646,"745260704802934784	745341781789769728	745737597180227585	745857995721089024	746055503629819905	746055563776188416	746060366455529472	746101167621570560	746198962865004545	746248282687430656	746861355307778048	761391176339468288	767913746677182464	841087261462654976	841099514324877313	841274086068232192	841317014195097601	841362886320611330	841624537020035076	841641391491035137	841701436782071809	841806862785871872	842071449875689487	842352290182901762	842383023626690560	842531883703554050	842533431322009600	842536939546906624	843225553004122115	843566850340478977	843567689066930177	843634463158419456	844725982699315200	853001983594287105	856996354438123525	857451932998303744	858638427641847809	861803706429427712	862710453994217472	863180287328571392	863371426019123201	863417243560026112	863460614663839744	877246470315012098	877525382202785792	877975965862957056	878022204558110725	878068530209472516	878332322856091648	878414268709748737	878625139788660737	878743757952299008	879067323377823744	879083926517690368	879096489292779521	879394063341977601	879442539073478657	879547410174824448	879641713240887297	879748615199223808	879753558446485504	879753599424897028	879768400863666176	879769289552691200	879825929870090240	879832691272802304	879871800536178690	879887843509899264	880023317729734656	880057572434354176	880065320806961152	880072759174365188	880085619107606529	880103485106159616	880103577120899072	880123967259934720	880179277429387264	880217344630456321	880259809890762752	880370662514339840	880382016360984576	880408749491363840	880444272989814788	880467643848937473	880604536628551680	880713553463959553	880735179287011328	880823366462189568	880850953406164997	881008003180318721	881203592035794944	881203727692165120	881203820533092353	881214538988666880	881292313225383936	881313071314194432	881596162498854912	881844855428849664	881934725463642115	882050927426973697	882340614985134082	883113774810624000	885810629864501252",fake

A handmade tin sign nailed to a lightpost announces â€œThe House of Worship, everyone welcomeâ€. Inside, congregants fan themselves, waiting to take their turn at the pulpit. The church doesnâ€™t have a minister and anyone is welcome. The service doesnâ€™t end until everyone who wishes to has sung, read or preached. Josh Bailey, 14 years free of alcohol, riffs for 20 minutes, mixing scripture with stories of his past. â€œI used to drink all the time, until I discovered the Lord. Ainâ€™t never had a buzz like Jesus Christ. â€ Josh and his wife Jenny have, he says, â€œnothing beyond their children and their faith in Jesus Christâ€. They receive a disability check (he has seizures) and payments for the odd jobs she finds. They donâ€™t have a car, so getting to the church requires a ride from a neighbor. Another member has brought a friend, a local woman who disappeared for four years into the larger towns up north, until she was found living on the streets and invited back. She told of her descent into meth, and of what it meant to be welcomed into a church. â€œI have had it rough, but with you, and the Lord, I will keep my head high. â€ It was four hours of euphoria that ended with everyone shaking hands and hugging  â€”   a reminder that, as Josh preached: â€œIf you shake my hand in church, you will shake my hand outside in the world. â€ The House of Worship sits in Floyd County, at the center of the eastern Kentucky coalfields, where there is plenty of despair, and plenty of support for Donald Trump. While cities such as New York, Los Angeles and DC have thrived, Floyd County, with a history of economic hardship, has declined further. The coal industry has been cut almost in half, addiction is rising, and town centers are being emptied by Walmarts. And while technology has helped decrease the sense of distance from bigger cities, the county remains economically and culturally separate. While the US has grown more diverse, it has stayed almost all white. While many Americans define themselves by their work, the residents of Floyd County define themselves equally by things outside of work. This is partly by desire, but also by necessity, since good jobs are rare. Instead, they find pride in their community: through church, morning breakfast groups, or at   tables outside the Walmart. The real energy of Prestonsburg (Floyd Countyâ€™s seat, population 3, 500) is at its edges. At the north end of town are   franchises strung along the road heading out of town  â€”   DQ, Hardeeâ€™s, McDonaldâ€™s. Each evening they fill with families eating dinner, and each morning with large groups who meet to socialize over coffee. Each restaurant has a dedicated group, but the largest collects at the Hardeeâ€™s. It comprises up to 30 mostly older men. The hardcore regulars have printed up laminated Breakfast Club membership cards with a joking slogan: â€œThere is great pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge. â€ For many, this is their new job. Darvin Burchet, 79, used to run coalmines, before they closed â€œbecause of Obamaâ€™s war on coalâ€. When he walks in, the others clear a prime corner space for him. He was the boss when many of them had jobs, and today he remains so. He proudly wears a Trump hat, as do many other morning members, and when the talk turns to politics, he is clear about why. â€œSociety has fallen apart and the economy has gone to hell. Finding a good worker now is almost impossible. People here lack pride. Canâ€™t fully blame them. You work all day and then go home and see a neighbor just getting a government handout. Why am I busting my ass while he isnâ€™t and doing just as good?â€ The rest of the table nods as he speaks. â€œMy father was a coalminer. Almost everyone hereâ€™s father was a coalminer. We all grew up poor, but had what we needed. It was a community. When someoneâ€™s house burned to the ground, we all helped out to rebuild it. Now guys will just steal the nails to sell for scrap metal, to buy drugs. â€ Down the road at the McDonaldâ€™s, Orbin and Benny Slone, cousins aged 75 and 78, join another group. Much is the same. Both are sons of coalminers, and both come each morning to meet friends. Orbin was a teacher and a bluegrass musician, and Benny worked in the factories up north before returning home. When I ask them about the townâ€™s changes, they take turns speaking, weaving their voices into one. â€œWe used to be   here. People wouldnâ€™t take gifts. We had pride and  . Then we were flooded with gifts from the government. It took our pride away. Now people only take pride in drugs. â€ This nostalgia is voiced by everyone in town, and is a change that is almost uniformly blamed on Obama. It is a change that is clear in the statistics. While coal jobs in the region having dropped 40% in last decade, and coal production 60% deaths from overdoses have surged. Unlike in other towns struggling with drugs, there are few visible signs. The streets are clean, without discarded needles, and homes well kept. There are no clusters of people milling about on corners. The impact is clear, though, above the city, on a mountaintop that once was mined for coal but is now home to a rehab center, run by Mountain Comprehensive Care, one of the townâ€™s largest employers. The center is the temporary home to dozens of men and women drawn from all across eastern Kentucky all are intent on ridding drugs from their lives, or following a mandate that they do so. One of them is Jerri Baird, 27, raised in a small home four miles from the closest town. Her dad was a nurse, and her grandfather mined coal. She started using drugs at 14. Her stresses came from many directions, including growing up gay in a Pentecostal church. â€œI was bad in school. Didnâ€™t ever feel I fit in. Grandfather smacked me in the face when he found out I liked women. Strong coalminer slap. Right across the face. â€ Like many others, she notes the drugs offered relief from the boredom. â€œThere was nobody doing nothing where I come from. Nobody working. Nothing. â€ When I asked her what she planned to do when back in town, she looked quizzical. â€œLike for work? I mean, there are no good jobs around. I done a few things. Clerked at restaurants, gas stations. Those sort of things. But that isnâ€™t much of work to brag about. â€ The loss of coal and the increase in drug use is felt in the heart of the community, in churches similar to the House of Worship. The city has more than two dozen that fill every Sunday.  At the Highland Free Will Baptist church David Garrett, 66, has been preaching for decades. He is a decorated Vietnam veteran (three bronze stars) a lifelong coalminer, and the son of a coalminer. He spoke to me just after Sunday service. â€œIn mining, it is feast or famine. Right now, we are in a famine and the community is suffering, but we help each other out. â€ As he spoke, he gestured to the congregation, half of whom were on their knees, washing the feet of the other half, in a yearly ritual.  â€œSometimes it just isnâ€™t enough. I have to bury too many congregants, many who kill themselves. One woman who I knew since she was a baby shot herself in the stomach with a . 38. The world is too material, and people donâ€™t think they need the community. Brother. Do they ever need it. â€ At the other end of the city, beneath mountains layered from mining, is a shopping plaza with Walmart and other discount brands. While many blame Walmartâ€™s arrival for the destruction of community by closing local shops, it is now an integral part of Prestonsburg, functioning as the de facto town square. It is the place where people come to gossip and teenagers to hang out, busy enough that the police patrol it on bicycles. Wooden tables and metal benches lining the plaza are filled with workers taking smoking breaks. When I ask one group of workers and their friends about coal, it sets off a chain of comments that spin into a long political argument  â€”   all polite. Obama is largely blamed, and the phrase â€œObamaâ€™s war on coalâ€ is being thrown around.  Across the plaza, at a wooden table outside a grocery store, Esther Blair, 63, is taking a break with a group. When her friends go inside, she smiles at me, and when I ask her about her life, she seems surprised. She is shy and polite. â€œI am not sure I have much to say that would be interesting to anyone beyond Prestonsburg. â€ I tell her she does, which surprises her. She pauses to smoke, each sentence almost whispered, each punctuated with a period of silence.  â€œI work as a cashier. I always have. But I worry a lot. About paying my bills. About my childâ€™s life. About my friends. I lost my husband two years ago. I have had a very hard life. I canâ€™t win for losing. â€ In the parking lot, Paul Gillespie, 28, is in his truck waiting for his wife in the Goodwill. He lost his leg from cancer when he was young and was placed in special education before quitting high school as a freshman. He pivots from the cab of the truck to the back edge, swinging his body on the doorframe. â€œI hated school. I was teased all the time. The other kids called me retard, or cripple. I learned to fight them. I had to. â€  I ask him about the Confederate flag attached to his truck. â€œI love the flag, because I love fishing and hunting. That is what it means to be from the south, and I am proud of being from the south. â€ During my week in Prestonsburg, I kept crossing paths with an older man who worked in the plaza. We chatted often. He was curious about why I was here, what New York was like. Each time I would ask to take his picture, and each time he refused with a cliched joke: â€œI am wanted by the FBI,â€ â€œI might break your camera. â€ The last day, I thanked him for his time, and tried once more.

But odds are you or your paper is going to write about   dirty dumb hillbillies filling their arms with heroin and pipes with meth. Everyone does that. They come here see the pretty landscape, but they donâ€™t see the goodness. â€",497,512,"914883483113328640	914884030104866816	914884579470839808	914885453534384128	914888834881552384	914893021832867840	914894761944862721	914898100099141632	914898970400497672	914899925640646661	914922185537486851	914922381365346305	914923714566922243	914927058308026369	914929821263818752	914932559032737792	914946755514466306	914948091417112577	914949618856800256	914950564940795904	914952132800974848	914952804799787008	914955884765368321	914962963206983681	914964518589140992	914965923743670273	914999271707070465	915029541042532352	915042994398445568	915054386027618304	915186829221138432	915222544545959937	915229504653725697	915246109055946754",fake

On Wednesday 9 March, people in some parts of Australia and   Asia will be able to witness the event. It will also be visible in Hawaii, east of the international dateline, where it will still be Tuesday 8 March. For those further west or east in Europe and America, it will already be night, so the sun will not be visible. Hereâ€™s what you need to know. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly between the Earth and the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth. It can only happen during a new moon  â€”   when the dark side of the moon is facing the Earth. Lunar eclipses, on the other hand, occur when the Earth passes between the sun and the Moon, casting a shadow over a full moon. The following graphic produced by Nasa shows from where you can best see the eclipse. As the Earth rotates, the best spot to see the eclipse will move along the the central blue zone. If youâ€™re lucky enough to be in that zone  â€”   most of which lies in Indonesia  â€”   then you should be able to see the sun completely blocked by the moon. If you are a long way north or south of that spot, you will only be able to see a partial eclipse. For example, people in Darwin in northern Australia will be able to see 60% of the sun covered by the moon. People in Perth should be able to see 10% of the sun blocked. Moving north, people in southern Vietnam and Thailand will see a 60% eclipse, while most people in Japan should be able to see a 20% eclipse. If youâ€™re confused by the times (and date) in those graphics, donâ€™t worry  â€”   the eclipse wonâ€™t be happening at midnight. The time there is Universal Time, which is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time. You can use Google or a site like this to convert it to your local time. In Australia, unfortunately the major centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart will miss out on the eclipse. But if youâ€™re in Queensland, and north of about Rockhampton, you should be able to see a partial eclipse from about 11am on the coast, or a bit earlier from inland. In the Northern Territory, it should happen around 10am. And most people in Western Australia should be able to see a partial eclipse  â€”   start watching from about 8am. In central Sumatra in Indonesia, where the eclipse will be a total one, it will happen almost immediately after the sun rises, so start watching from about 6. 30am. In Jakarta, you should see about a 90% eclipse about 15 minutes later. In Japan, you should be able to see about a 20% eclipse. It will start at about 10. 20am in the west. In Hawaii, if the skies are clear, you should be able to see a 60% eclipse from about 5. 30pm, just as the sun is preparing to set. Here are some guides for key centres along the route of the eclipse. The following places will experience totality at these times (all times local): And these cities will also see their peak partial eclipse at the following (local) times: The total eclipse viewing time will span an hour either side of these times. Wherever you are, pop by the Guardian website and follow our stories, which will be collecting photographs of the event as it happens. Do not look directly at the sun. The eclipse itself can be viewed safely with the naked eye for only a few seconds, and only if you are in a location where the sun will be completely covered by the moon. Looking at even a sliver of the sun can cause permanent eye damage or blindness.  And your sunglasses donâ€™t help either. Read on to find out the safest way to watch. As we warned above, do not look directly at the sun  â€”   but there are some materials you can use to safely look at the sun. You could buy some â€œnumber 14 welderâ€™s glassâ€ from a welding supply outlet or from some hardware stores. You can also use aluminized mylar, which can even be cut with scissors. Another way to see it happen is to make your own pinhole camera. Basically, it requires poking a hole in a box, and putting some paper over the back of it. Follow directions in this video: Solar eclipses can occur up to five times a year, although that is rare. Nasa keeps a list of past and future eclipses and according to that, only 25 years in the past 5, 000 have had five solar eclipses. Each eclipse is viewable from a different location. For example, in 2015 a total eclipse of the sun was viewable from the UK, but that country wonâ€™t see another one until

Itâ€™s that special time of the month: weâ€™re launching episode two of our video series Vagina Dispatches today, and itâ€™s all about periods.  Some women have chosen to stop their periods, and we (Mae and Mona) are two of them. So, in this second video, we speak to a doctor who thinks periods are unnatural, a former Olympian, a menstrual blood artist and a formerly incarcerated woman to find out if we should stop having periods. It seems as though almost everyone with a uterus has a period nightmare story. But what about times when your period has been a blessing in your life? Or maybe we still havenâ€™t heard the bloody worst of it  â€”   either way, weâ€™d love to hear about your experiences at vagina. dispatches@theguardian. com. Speaking of you  â€¦     Turns out, when you publish a video about vulvas, ask people to draw one and take a genital knowledge quiz on a global website, you get some responses. To our joy, the vast majority of ours were thoughtful and incredibly interesting. We heard from audiences in at least six continents (Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America and South America). So far, people have submitted more than 16, 000 vulva drawings from at least 66 countries! We also got at least eight Volvos (Yes, like the car. Very clever.) And, of course, 391 submitted drawings of penises. We also heard from some people asking why we think this is important enough to deserve so much time and energy. We heard from way more people telling us what the first video means to them. Here is just a sampling: When I was in my 50s, I used a mirror to look at what was down there, feeling at the same time a great sense of guilt and  ! Catholic conditioning on sin and shame decided my attitude to my body for most of my life. I love my mom a lot, but to this day, I think she is still uncomfortable with conversations about sex or female anatomy. I have two girls, ages 9 and 12. Iâ€™ve already given them â€˜the talkâ€™ years ago, and they know thereâ€™s nothing   to talk about with regards to reproduction. We are just on the edge of talking about sex for pleasure. I want them to feel empowered sexually as they grow up and to feel very comfortable with their bodies. Iâ€™m going to show them this video today. There might be some giggling, but also some learning!  I sent this to my wife right away, because it felt like very important education for everyone. I have always been horribly   of my whole body and still havenâ€™t come to terms with the changes that happened to it since I gave birth to my son  â€”   over 14 years ago! I still feel embarrassed and ashamed because it all looks so different down there and it makes me feel ugly and like a freak. Iâ€™ve never seen any other female genitalia (except for the minimalist line drawings in high school textbooks and tampon leaflets) so I didnâ€™t know it was normal to not be all â€˜tight and tidyâ€™ like the pictures. â€  I am writing this email on my Amazon Kindle. Autocorrect changed [it to] the word California (see!) California . .. It happened FOUR TMES then happened again as you can see above, even after I added the word c l I t o r I s to the dictionary. The only way I can write the word is to put a space between each letter. So . .. letâ€™s try to write the word penis. Oh, look at that no problem with the word penis. This was so illuminating. I was distressed, however, to hear that so many young women are feeling the need to get surgery on their labia   it doesnâ€™t fit the â€˜aestheticâ€™ out there. This reminds me of all these   shaving their pubic hair  â€”   and is this (like the surgery) most probably for men? In any case, I learned so much today. I didnâ€™t even know where my pee hole was before I took the test!  Iâ€™m a man, 50 now, who has had issues around size since I was at boarding school. I had a penis enlargement when I was about 32. Didnâ€™t work. Through healthy honest relationships, experience, therapy, [and] menâ€™s work, I came to accept my penis . .. and also slowly gained an idea of what was â€˜normalâ€™.

We need to recognise that the diplomacy has never faced up to the need for an initial partition or zones of influence involving neighbouring states on the path to an eventual unified settlement in Syria. Between 2012 and 2014, Turkey was ready to create a protected area in Syria for refugees, but for various reasons this was never supported by Nato. Turkey was understandably very reluctant to move militarily across the border into Syria on its own. When Russia extended an airfield close to Latakia, not far from the naval port it has had in Syria since 1971, and put sophisticated aeroplanes in to protect Assadâ€™s forces, everything changed. Turkey shot down a Russian plane and felt threatened by Kurdish forces pushing along its border with Syria. Turkish relations also became very strained within Nato, particularly with the US over strategies for dealing with Islamic State and the EU over refugee policies and human rights. Turkey responded perfectly reasonably by defusing tensions with Russia. In this period the Russians militarily achieved their objective, reinforced by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon and Iranian forces, of winning back control of the key roads linking Damascus to the Mediterranean Sea for Assad. These forces, as a consequence, are back in control of this area, including Hama, which has become a Russian zone of influence. Only Turkey is in a political and military position to intervene on the ground over Aleppo and it is demonstrating this at present by attacking Isis. Turkey can now, because of changed circumstances, create a crucial balancing factor in Syria by taking urgent humanitarian action with its troops and air power in relieving the siege of Aleppo. Under the UN charter, even if the security council is blocked by a Russian veto, Turkey has a regional locus and a measure of legitimacy, having taken large numbers of Syrian refugees. There is potentially the necessary support within Nato for such an intervention by Turkey. Already special forces from a number of countries, particularly the US and UK, are operating in Syria on the ground and they have the skills in helping to target artillery, missiles and in the last analysis aircraft. Intelligence is already fully shared with Turkey but a greater effort would have to be put in by other Nato countries. Naturally there are some in Turkey who would prefer to have Nato ground troops, but there are others who wisely see the dangers of this. It would be far preferable for Turkey to act as a regional power supported by Nato, and by keeping ground troops out it avoids the whole initiative being seen as an   confrontation. What provides a new basis for Turkish intervention is that on 23 September Bekir BozdaÄŸ, Turkeyâ€™s justice minister, announced in Istanbul that the US   Joe Biden, had accepted that there is â€œconcrete evidenceâ€ that Fethullah GÃ¼len, a Turkish exile living in the US, was behind Julyâ€™s failed coup. Assuming there is substantive evidence in relation to GÃ¼len, the political path is therefore open for early and decisive action over Syria. GÃ¼len left Turkey for Pennsylvania in 1999. The GÃ¼len movement, or Cemaat, which he inspires, is an Islamic community in Turkey and overseas. It operates both openly and underground in Turkey and while once the movement favoured President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan it is now deeply opposed to him. ErdoÄŸan has alleged that GÃ¼len was the mastermind behind the coup and Turkey asked for his extradition from the US. It now looks almost certain that the US justice system will return him for trial in Turkey. This means that a very damaging source of strain between Washington and Ankara is closer to being resolved. Turkish military action should and could be mounted within hours of a decision by ErdoÄŸan. It would have the power to implement a   zone (NFZ) with protected land corridors for humanitarian aid and the flow of people both ways into and out of Aleppo. This should be accompanied by a demand for the withdrawal of Assad forces to a line between Hama and Aleppo. Of course so recently after a failed military coup there is little appetite from some military leaders to undertake such a   operation. But there is a   to this, for it could successfully restore the reputation of the armed forces in Turkey and demonstrate their loyalty. Nato forces would guard Turkey from the air as it conducted this humanitarian operation. Air activity outside the NFZ would continue against Isis in Syria and Iraq by Russia, Nato and Assad forces. A Kurdish area of influence in Syria in relation to Isis would continue de facto, but there would be no de jure implications, for that would be both unacceptable to Turkey and   a much more difficult   settlement of issues that involve Iraq and Iran. Areas of influence would apply in other parts of Syria, if its neighbours Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Jordan are prepared to underpin them predominantly for dealing effectively with Isis. This whole initiative should be discussed at the highest military level, first in the   Council, before going to the security council. It is probable that Russia would veto it in the council, but we should not assume that, and on a    basis it might be possible to set the initiative in a context where Russia would see that its own sphere of influence was not being challenged. The humanitarian imperative is for the region to act and the world to help.",491,352,"930143082640826368	930622544926990336	940354123748249600",fake

politifact14062,observeronline.news/sarah-palin-coma-hit-run/,JUST IN: Sarah Palin In A Coma After Hit And Run,"The devastating trauma and abuse inflicted on children held by Australia in offshore detention has been laid bare in the largest cache of leaked documents released from inside its immigration regime. More than 2, 000 leaked incident reports from Australiaâ€™s detention camp for asylum seekers on the remote Pacific island of Nauru  â€”   totalling more than 8, 000 pages  â€”   are published by the Guardian today. The Nauru files set out as never before the assaults, sexual abuse,   attempts, child abuse and living conditions endured by asylum seekers held by the Australian government, painting a picture of routine dysfunction and cruelty. The Guardianâ€™s analysis of the files reveal that children are vastly   in the reports. More than half of the 2, 116 reports  â€”   a total of 1, 086 incidents, or 51. 3%  â€”   involve children, although children made up only about 18% of those in detention on Nauru during the time covered by the reports, May 2013 to October 2015. The findings come just weeks after the brutal treatment of young people in juvenile detention in the Northern Territory was exposed, leading to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announcing a   public inquiry. The reports range from a guard allegedly grabbing a boy and threatening to kill him once he is living in the community to guards allegedly slapping children in the face. In September 2014 a teacher reported that a young classroom helper had requested a   shower instead of a   shower. â€œHer request has been accepted on condition of sexual favours. It is a male security person. She did not state if this has or hasnâ€™t occurred. The security officer wants to view a boy or girl having a shower. â€ Some reports contain distressing examples of behaviour by traumatised children. According to a report from September 2014, a girl had sewn her lips together. A guard saw her and began laughing at her. In July that year a child under the age of 10 undressed and invited a group of adults to insert their fingers into her vagina in February 2015 a young girl gestured to her vagina and said a male asylum seeker â€œcut her from underâ€.  In the files there are seven reports of sexual assault of children, 59 reports of assault on children, 30 of   involving children and 159 of threatened   involving children. The reports show extraordinary acts of desperation. One pregnant woman, after being told she would need to give birth on Nauru in October 2015, was agitated and in tears. â€œI give my baby to Australia to look after,â€ she pleaded with a caseworker, adding: â€œI donâ€™t want to have my baby in PNG, the [Nauru hospital] or have it in this dirty environment. â€ The files raise stark questions about how information is reported on Nauru, one of Australiaâ€™s two offshore detention centres for asylum seekers who arrive by boat. They highlight serious concerns about the ongoing risks to children and adults held on the island. They show how the Australian government has failed to respond to warning signs and reveal sexual assault allegations  â€”   many involving children  â€”   that have never been previously disclosed. The most damning evidence emerges from the words of the staff working in the detention centre themselves  â€”   the people who compile the reports. These caseworkers, guards, teachers and medical officers have been charged with caring for hundreds of asylum seekers on the island. The publication is likely to renew calls for an end to the political impasse that has seen children in Australiaâ€™s care languish on Nauru for more than three years.  Nauru is the worldâ€™s smallest island state, home to fewer than 10, 000 people. Australia supplies aid and buys services from Nauruâ€™s government and companies, leading to accusations Nauru is effectively a â€œclient stateâ€. On the last official count at the end of June, 442 people  â€”   338 men, 55 women and 49 children  â€”   were held in the Nauru regional processing centre. The other offshore centre, on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, was holding 854 people, all men. Australiaâ€™s policy has been criticised regularly by the UN. The Guardian is publishing the files because it believes Australians have the right to know more about the regime at the Nauru and Manus centres, which costs Australian taxpayers $1. 2bn a year.  The documents cover the period examined in a review into allegations of sexual assault, the Australian Human Rights Commissionâ€™s inquiry into children in detention as well as the period examined by a Senate inquiry and beyond. They encompass the final days of Laborâ€™s time in government and the ruling conservative Coalitionâ€™s time in office since September 2013.  In each successive inquiry, the Australian government and its contractors, including Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield Services) and its subcontractor Wilson Security, have maintained that they are improving conditions and reporting measures to raise the quality of life on the island. In April 2015 the Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said he wanted to make Nauru a â€œsafe environmentâ€. He said he had â€œinstructed the department to do whatever they possibly can, both domestically within the detention network here and with our partners in the regional processing centres, to make sure that the standard of care is as high as it possibly can beâ€. Wilson Security has previously told the Australian parliament it had â€œrobust policies, procedures and processes that support the operations in Nauruâ€. It continued: â€œAllegations of sexual assault are treated in a timely and sensitive manner. Where Wilson Security receives an allegation we take immediate action following disclosure or notification. â€ But the files show a very different picture. Rather than serious events diminishing, they continued  â€”   and in some cases escalated  â€”   during the course of 2015. A vast number of incidents from across the timeframe have never before been reported. Many asylum seekers held on Nauru were unable to leave the detention compounds during the period covered by the files. Some had been granted permission to leave on day trips but were closely monitored to ensure they returned before curfews. Those found to be refugees were released into the Nauruan community  â€”   yet still remain effectively detained on the remote island.  The primary evidence from the files backs up testimony from former immigration detention staff members interviewed by the Guardian as part of its investigation.  Access to Nauru is tightly controlled. Events on the island are reported sporadically through refugee advocates and whistleblowers, but the Australian governmentâ€™s policy of shrouding its offshore detention centres in secrecy has prevented the reporting of many serious incidents. The Nauru files shatter that secrecy.  In response to the Nauru files, the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection said in a statement: â€œThe Australian government continues to support the Nauruan government to provide for the health, welfare and safety of all transferees and refugees in Nauru. â€œThe documents published today are evidence of the rigorous reporting procedures that are in place in the regional processing centre  â€”   procedures under which any alleged incident must be recorded, reported and where necessary investigated. Many of the incident reports reflect unconfirmed allegations or uncorroborated statements and claims  â€”   they are not statements of proven fact. â€œAll alleged criminal incidents within the regional processing centre are referred to the Nauru Police Force (NPF) for investigation. Refugees living in the community are encouraged to report all criminal incidents to the NPF. A number of matters remain under active investigation. â€œThe department is examining the matters published today to ensure all of these matters have been reported appropriately by service providers, consistent with the policies and procedures covering such matters. â€ The department added that it â€œalso takes seriously its role in supporting the government of Nauru to protect children from abuse, neglect or exploitationâ€.  Allegations of sexual assault, particularly against young women, are a persistent theme of the files. In one report an asylum seeker described being told she was â€œon a listâ€ written by local Nauruan guards naming single women they were â€œwaiting forâ€. â€œShe has received offers to get her pregnant when she gets out,â€ the caseworker wrote. They reveal allegations of misconduct by Wilson Security guards at the detention centre. In one report a â€œcultural adviserâ€ for Wilson Security, the company that employs guards at the detention camp, allegedly told an asylum seeker who had been sexually assaulted in camp that â€œrape in Australia is very common and people donâ€™t get punishedâ€. The caseworker who filed the report wrote that the female asylum seeker also told her the guard had questioned whether the sexual assault had occurred and said: â€œIf that happened to you why didnâ€™t you scream at the time?â€ â€œYou have to take it out of your head if you go into Nauru then he [the alleged perpetrator] could be your neighbour or if you go to Cambodia then he could be on the plane next to you,â€ the adviser reportedly told the woman. â€œYou also have to teach your son to treat this man nicely. â€  There are allegations that bus drivers  â€”   employed by Australiaâ€™s detention contractors  â€”   took voyeuristic pictures of women in the camp to use to masturbate. Other reports range from a man facing threats of sexual violence from other asylum seekers to a woman threatening   because she doesnâ€™t want â€œmen to touch her bodyâ€.  Speaking before the publication of the Nauru files, Prof Louise Newman, a former member of the Immigration Health Advisory Group, says such attacks have continued. She speaks â€œon a nightly basisâ€ to women on Nauru who have been sexually assaulted.  â€œI am prepared to say the sexual assault of women is a major problem on Nauru,â€ Newman says. â€œSome of the womenâ€™s descriptions of what is happening to them is incredibly alarming in terms of the lack of process. â€œItâ€™s not just one incident. If it was one incident and there had been a poor response in a developing nation then maybe it was something to work on. I think what weâ€™re seeing is a systemic lack of processes and understanding of this. â€ Health and medical experts have consistently warned of the mental harm caused by prolonged detention. The files show in graphic detail how this harm has manifested.  One man asked a caseworker where he could buy bullets so he could get someone else to shoot him. A woman sharpened a pencil with a razor blade, then cut her wrists. Another wrapped a rope around her neck and tried to hang herself. She had to be held up by guards until she could be cut down.  In one report from January 2015, a teenage girl struggled to cope after her motherâ€™s miscarriage. She began having â€œongoing hallucinations from a â€˜small personâ€™ â€ a Save the Children worker wrote. â€œShe is unsure if it is a man or women but has a dark face and is the size of a child. â€ The hallucination had threatened to kill her: â€œAt other times the hallucination is encouraging [REDACTED] to kill herself. â€  The toll on childrenâ€™s mental health is particularly heavy. According to an April 2015 report a girl began screaming â€œuncontrollablyâ€ during a fight in a recreation tent.  â€œDuring this time [REDACTED] also gouged at her own face consistently and pulled her own hair,â€ the child protection officer wrote. â€œIt was observed that [REDACTED] could not breath properly and had a glazed look in her eyes. â€ Other files show the anguished outbursts to which some asylum seekers have become prone since their detention: one report described a woman seeking a bandage after punching a metal pole with both hands. Another told of a woman who began banging her head with her fists after an altercation with guards. Another woman carved her husbandâ€™s name on to her chest she wanted a tattoo but could not get one so used a knife instead. Her husband lives in Australia.  Speaking to the Guardian before the publication of the Nauru files, Dr Peter Young, a former medical director of mental health for Australiaâ€™s immigration detention system, said: â€œ  and suicide attempts increase steadily after six months in detention. This is driven by hopelessness which is known to be the strongest predictor of suicide.  â€œSome   such as lip sewing, has a protest element and is common in prisoners as an expression of feeling powerless and voiceless. â€  Other reports show the squalor and the difficulties getting medical treatment. One female asylum seeker, who has urinary incontinence, complained about how she was no longer provided with sanitary pads to treat the condition. According to another report a female guard allegedly refused to let a child under 10 use a toilet and made her squat on the ground instead. Her mother told a caseworker the guard had then shone her torch on the girlâ€™s genitals.  The logs illustrate the squalid conditions often experienced by asylum seekers at the centre, including frequent complaints of cockroaches infesting tents housing the detainees.  One report showed how the companiesâ€™ failure to communicate traumatises asylum seekers. The medical provider International Health and Medical Services ran a â€œmass casualty simulationâ€ that had people daubed with fake blood walking around. But the plan was not reported to the Save the Children teachers at the nearby school. â€œThe incident prompted every student to start talking about incidents of   they had witnessed,â€ a teacher wrote. â€œThey did not know this one was false and so were forced to experience another incident at school, which should be a safe, distracting environment. â€ Nauru files reporting team: Paul Farrell, Nick Evershed, Helen Davidson, Ben Doherty, Ri Liu, Anna Livsey, David Constable, Tom Ross, Josh Wall, Nikki Marshall, Merran Hitchick and Patrick Keneally, â€¢ In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

The incident occurred in a wooded area near a fast food chain in Whitecourt, central Alberta, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said on Wednesday.  William Gibb, 31, from Red Deer, Alberta, had stopped at a Tim Hortons outlet on his   drive to Grand Prairie on the evening of 26 December and had let his dog out for a walk, Whitecourt RCMP Sgt Tom Kalis said.  Shortly after, Gibb heard the 36kg (80lbs) female husky whimpering in pain and found a cougar pinning her to the ground.  â€œHe punched the cougar, yelled at it and got it to release the dog. Then he called the police,â€ Kalis said. â€œHe was quite lucky. â€  Gibb kept the cougar at bay and tended to his injured dog until police arrived and killed the cougar. The dog needed medical attention but Gibb was not seriously injured, RCMP said.  Kalis said cougar sightings were not uncommon around Whitecourt because the town is surrounded by forests, but it is unusual for cougars to attack dogs or other

The House intelligence committee released the declassified portions to provide what the panelâ€™s chairman called â€œa fuller account of Edward Snowdenâ€™s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for US national securityâ€. The report is highly critical of Snowden, the former NSA contractor who revealed the scale of the NSAâ€™s surveillance program, claiming that he did not attempt to communicate his concerns to his supervisors before providing the Guardian with   NSA documents. However, the reportâ€™s credibility was immediately condemned by Snowdenâ€™s lawyer Ben Wizner. He dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. â€œThe House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,â€ Wizner said. â€œThe report wholly ignores Snowdenâ€™s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower. â€ The political motivation of the report was called into question in September when a   executive summary was released on the eve of the premiere of Oliver Stoneâ€™s biopic on the whistleblower, claiming that Snowden â€œdamagedâ€ national security, without providing evidence to support the claim. Barton Gellman, the   Pulitzer prize winner who used Edward Snowdenâ€™s disclosures in his reporting on the NSA while at the Washington Post, dismantled the reportâ€™s claims when the executive summary was published, calling it â€œaggressively dishonestâ€ and â€œtriflingâ€.  On Thursday as the declassified portions of the report were published in full, Snowden, the former national security whistleblower, pushed back further against the accusations in a series of tweets. â€œUnsurprising that HPSCIâ€™s report is rifled with obvious falsehoods. The only surprise is how accidentally exonerating it is,â€ Snowden tweeted. The panelâ€™s top Republican and Democrat joined in castigating Snowden, who in 2013 revealed US government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by US companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden subsequently fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution, after his disclosures triggered international outrage over the reach of US spy operations. The report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliamentâ€™s upper house, who asserted that â€œSnowden did share intelligenceâ€ with the Russian government. The Pentagon found 13 undisclosed â€œhigh riskâ€ security issues caused by Snowdenâ€™s disclosure to media outlets, including the Guardian, of tens of thousands of the US eavesdropping agencyâ€™s most sensitive documents, according to the congressional inquiry. If the Chinese or Russians obtained access to materials related to these issues, â€œAmerican troops will be at greater risk in any future conflict,â€ the report said. The committee chairman, the Republican congressman Devin Nunes, said it â€œwill take a long time to mitigate the damageâ€ Snowden allegedly caused. The committeeâ€™s top Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden was not a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. â€œMost of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americansâ€™ privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to Americaâ€™s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,â€ Schiff said. But on Twitter, Snowden added that the report itself admitted that he â€œpurged and abandonedâ€ hard drives containing the material, rather than bring them to Russia. Release of the report comes as the intelligence community has accused Russia of interfering in the US elections.  Snowdenâ€™s supporters have pressed Barack Obama to pardon him before he leaves office in late January. But the details in the intelligence committeeâ€™s report, coupled with the intense focus on Russiaâ€™s hacking of Democratic emails, could doom the push for a pardon.

Several news organizations reported on Wednesday that the   is to nominate the former   general to run the cabinet department responsible for enforcing US immigration laws, as well as a number of important agencies including the coast guard, the Secret Service, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). They cited unnamed sources familiar with the Trump transition process. â€œI canâ€™t confirm or deny just because itâ€™s the  â€™s decision to reveal his picks,â€ Trump aide Kellyanne Conway told reporters. â€œThey had a very productive and exciting meeting recently and obviously General Kelly is qualified for that job. â€  Kelly, who stepped down in 2016 as commander of the US Southern Command, is the most senior US officer to have lost a child in the war on terror. His son Robert, a first lieutenant in the marines, was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010. Kelly, 66, is the third general sought for a   job in the new administration.  Trump, who has no military experience, also plans to nominate retired Gen James Mattis to lead the Department of Defense and picked retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser.  Kelly differed with Barack Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United Statesâ€™ southern border with Mexico.  As head of the Southern Command, his final leadership post in a   military career, Kelly was responsible for US military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the controversial detention facility at GuantÃ¡namo Bay. He retired in January. Even before Trump formally announced Kellyâ€™s nomination, the top Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee indicated his approval.  â€œGeneral Kelly is a man of steady leadership who has years of experience working with our neighbors in Latin America as commander of US Southern Command. Having worked with General Kelly personally on efforts to address the root causes of the surge in migration of children and families to our southern border, I am encouraged by his ability to build relationships with our partners in the region,â€ Senator Tom Carper of Delaware said in a statement. Some at the Department of Homeland Security see Kelly, with his military background, as a blank slate on a host of issues the department deals with, from immigration to airport security to addressing natural disasters. But there is a sense of relief that Kelly is not as hardline as some of Trumpâ€™s other potential choices, like Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, or Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor. â€œThe consensus is heâ€™s someone people can work with, but heâ€™s an unknown entity,â€ said a knowledgeable US official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Kelly is a renowned marine with extensive experience in western Iraq during the darkest days of the US occupation, first as assistant commander of the 1st marine division in 2004 and later in 2008, as commander of I Marine Expeditionary Force. His leadership experience prompted defense secretary Robert Gates to make him Gatesâ€™ senior military assistant, a perch from which Kelly became the leader of US Southern Command in 2013. . Kelly is personally close to his fellow marine and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Joe Dunford, whose tenure as the senior US military officer runs through 2017. Dunford reportedly delivered Kelly the news of his son 1st Lt Robert Kellyâ€™s death. At Southcom, Kelly quickly developed a reputation for opposition to Obamaâ€™s intended closure of GuantÃ¡namo Bay. Kelly confronted a widespread hunger strike by the detainees, protesting the limbo of their treatment and the physical pain of being forcibly tube fed, which had prompted international attention. Kellyâ€™s response was a press blackout. GuantÃ¡namo and Southcom officials stopped providing updates to reporters on the detainees participating in the protest, either on the number of striking detainees or their conditions. To avoid discussing the hunger strike and its rationale, they introduced a euphemism when asked about it: â€œ    fastingâ€. The official military guidance document on the subject, the Miami Herald reported, was titled â€œMedical Management of Detainees With Weight Lossâ€ replacing an earlier version titled â€œMedical Management of Detainees on Hunger Strikeâ€. Several US officials involved in GuantÃ¡namo issues saw Kellyâ€™s hand in Pentagon obstinacy toward Obamaâ€™s plan to close the detention facility. Asked in 2015 whether Guantanamo would in fact close, Kelly said: â€œIf youâ€™re talking about GuantÃ¡namo in terms of detention ops, I donâ€™t know. Certainly, the president wants to close it. And until that happens, I will take care of those prisoners in a dignified way that sees to their every need. â€ Kellyâ€™s GuantÃ¡namo experience has created a deep well of suspicion among human rights campaigners, who are nervously watching DHS in the Trump era for discrimination against Muslims and a new wave of forcible deportations for undocumented immigrants. â€œThe Department of Homeland Security was created to work to keep the US safe. But Kellyâ€™s support of policies and practices at GuantÃ¡namo have done nothing of the sort, they have made the US less safe. Senators definitely need ask him questions and challenge his record on that as part of the confirmation process,â€ said Human Rights Watchâ€™s Laura Pitter. In 2010, weeks after his sonâ€™s death, Kelly delivered a caustic speech in St Louis that hit many notes Trump would later use to successful political effect. Kelly savaged the â€œmedia eliteâ€ for â€œset[ting] up the â€˜know it allâ€™ chattering class to offer their endless criticismâ€ of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He questioned the patriotism of unnamed elites and rejected the support of anyone who did not back the wars themselves, saying veterans â€œhold in disdain those who claim to support them but not the cause that takes their innocence, their limbs, and even their livesâ€.  He continued: â€œYes, we are at war, and we are winning, but you wouldnâ€™t know it because successes go unreported. â€ Kelly has not always been consistent on that score. In the preface to a 2009 marine history document, Kelly wrote: â€œWords like â€˜wonâ€™ or â€˜victoryâ€™ really do not apply when speaking about counterinsurgency operations. â€ In Iraq, Kelly wrote, â€œto a very large degree, we  â€”   the US military and civilians  â€”   were the source of the insurgency. Honest men and women can argue the whys,   and     but ultimately, it was mostly about unfulfilled promises and the   military approach taken by some that caused events to spiral out of control. â€  While Kellyâ€™s 2010 speech did not blame Islam for terrorism, a conflation made by Trump national security   Mike Flynn, it took an expansive view of the terrorist threat, one Obama rejected in his final national security speech on Wednesday. â€œOur enemy is savage, offers absolutely no quarter and has a single focus  â€”   and that is either kill every one of us here at home, or enslave us with a sick form of extremism that serves no God or purpose that decent men and women could ever grasp,â€ Kelly said in 2010. In the context of remarking upon the bonds between marines, Kelly disparaged â€œworshipping at the altar of diversityâ€ and an America as an â€œunruly gaggle of â€˜hyphenatedâ€™ or â€˜ â€™ individualsâ€ in lieu of a â€œmelting pot that stitches and strengthens by a sense of shared history, values, customs, hopes and dreamsâ€.

politifact13913,http://uspostman.com/2017/03/nbc-just-fired-megyn-kelly-new-show-begins/,UsPostman.com is for sale (Us Postman),"Thereâ€™s a reason why politicians pose with babies, a reason why the oldest   in the campaign managerâ€™s handbook is of a candidate holding, embracing or kissing a tiny child. There is no faster way of humanising a politician, demonstrating that he or she is a caring, sensitive and loving human being than having them show tenderness towards an infant. Besides, everyone smiles when they see a baby  â€”   and some of that good feeling is bound to rub off on the person we see with them. We canâ€™t help ourselves. A prime, if subtle, example came when Michelle Obama sought to introduce her husband to the Democratic convention that nominated him for the presidency in 2008. Barack, she said, is â€œthe same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer, inching along at a snailâ€™s pace, peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror, feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands . .. â€ Clearly that was the one bit of Michelle Obamaâ€™s 2008 speech Team Trump didnâ€™t, er, study closely. For we can now add to the long list of political rules Trump has broken  â€”   donâ€™t insult disabled people, donâ€™t insult war heroes, donâ€™t insult the parents of a fallen soldier  â€”   one more. Donâ€™t be mean to babies. At a rally in Virginia on Tuesday, a baby started crying. At first the Republican nominee affected to indulge the interruption. â€œDonâ€™t worry about that baby,â€ he said. â€œI love babies . .. I hear that baby crying and I like it. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Donâ€™t worry, donâ€™t worry . .. Itâ€™s young and beautiful and healthy and thatâ€™s what we want, OK. â€ But a few minutes later, when the bawling had not stopped, Trump lost patience. â€œActually I was only kidding,â€ he said. â€œYou can get the baby out of here. â€ Of the mother misguided enough to have been reassured by his earlier words, he said, â€œI think she believed me that I love having a baby crying while Iâ€™m speaking. Thatâ€™s OK. People donâ€™t understand. â€ On one level, this is no more than yet another, relatively minor example of Trump doing something political convention would deem unacceptable  â€”   signalling to his most committed supporters that heâ€™s a   and a maverick and therefore someone they can trust to smash the system they despise. For a certain kind of Trump devotee, thereâ€™s nothing he can do that will repel them: as he himself has noted, he could stand on Fifth Avenue shooting people and theyâ€™d still vote for him. For others, though, it might play out differently. The most obvious group is women, where Trump lags far, far behind Hillary Clinton: 34% to 57% according to the latest CNN survey. Pollsters have identified a particular segment of that group as crucial in this election: white,   women. They can often lean towards the Republicans, but are currently recoiling from Trump. This latest episode is unlikely to endear him further. Not least because it has acted as a reminder of Trumpâ€™s curious attitude to young children. A lawyer has testified that in 2011, when she asked for a break during a legal proceeding involving Donald Trump so that she could pump breast milk for her baby, he turned to her   and screamed, â€œYouâ€™re disgusting, youâ€™re disgusting. â€ More telling still is an episode the Daily Beast rightly describes as â€œcreepyâ€. In 1994, his wife Marla had just given birth to a daughter, Tiffany, and Trump gave an interview about the new arrival. â€œWell, I think that sheâ€™s got a lot of Marla,â€ he said. â€œSheâ€™s a really beautiful baby, and sheâ€™s got Marlaâ€™s legs. We donâ€™t know whether sheâ€™s got this part yet, but time will tell. â€ As Trump said the words â€œthis partâ€ he gestured toward his chest. Thereâ€™s a reason why even respected political commentators now state baldly that Trump has some kind of personality disorder. There seems to be something missing. His attacks on the Khan family  â€”   whose son was killed in combat  â€”   were faulted above all for their complete lack of basic human empathy. In Virginia on Tuesday, he couldnâ€™t show empathy for a mother struggling with a crying baby, let alone the baby itself. They say thereâ€™s no hiding from the long, intense scrutiny of a presidential campaign. It reveals character. It finds you out.

politifact14259,www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/04/28/bumble-bee-foods-tuna-worker-cooked/26517161/,Bumble Bee Foods charged after man cooked with tuna,"Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said Donald Trumpâ€™s election victory made him â€œsick to my stomachâ€ and suggested America was heading for a   downfall. â€œHe is in charge of our country,â€ Popovich said in a lengthy and impassioned press conference speech before Fridayâ€™s   win over the Pistons. â€œThatâ€™s disgusting. â€  Popovich spoke of his anger and frustration after Trumpâ€™s victory on Tuesday. â€œNot because the Republicans won or anything,â€ he said, â€œbut the disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. I live in that country where half the people ignored all that to elect someone. Thatâ€™s the scariest part of the whole thing to me. â€ After suggesting he needed more time to put his thoughts together, Popovich spoke for several minutes, even telling a reporter who tried to interrupt at one point that he wasnâ€™t finished. He said: â€œIâ€™m a rich white guy and Iâ€™m sick to my stomach thinking about it,â€ said Popovich, a graduate of the US air force academy and the next coach of the US Olympic menâ€™s basketball team. â€œI canâ€™t imagine being a Muslim right now or a woman or an   Hispanic, a handicapped person. How disenfranchised they might feel. For anyone in those groups that voted for him, itâ€™s just beyond my comprehension how they ignore all that. â€ He continued: â€œI live in that country where half the people ignored all of that to elect someone. Thatâ€™s the scariest part for me. Itâ€™s got nothing to do with the environment, Obamacare, and all the other stuff. We live in a country that ignored all of those values that we would hold our kids accountable for. Theyâ€™d be grounded for years if they acted and said the things that have been said by Donald Trump in that campaign. I look at the evangelicals and wonder: â€˜Those values donâ€™t mean anything to them? â€™â€ Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy and Warriors coach Steve Kerr also criticised Trumpâ€™s rhetoric earlier this week. Van Gundy said: â€œWe should be ashamed for what we stand for as the United States today. â€ Popovich said: â€œAnd what gets lost in the process are African Americans, and Hispanics, and women, and the gay population, not to mention the   developmental stage exhibited by him when he made fun of the handicapped person. I mean, come on. Thatâ€™s what a     bully does. And he was elected president of the United States. We would have scolded our kids. We would have had discussions until we were blue in the face trying to get them to understand these things. He is in charge of our country. Thatâ€™s disgusting. â€ When a reporter interrupted him, Popovich said, â€œIâ€™m not done. â€ He finished by saying: â€œMy final conclusion is, my big fear is  â€”   we are Rome. â€ Popovich has made the comparison with the Roman Empire before. In September, Popovich told the Wall Street Journal: â€œI worry that maybe Iâ€™m being a little too pessimistic, but Iâ€™m beginning to have a harder time believing that we are not Rome. Rome didnâ€™t fall in 20 days or 30 years. It took a couple hundred years. The question is: are we in that process and we donâ€™t even know it? I really am starting to think about that.

politifact14839,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/,Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap,"JosÃ© Mourinho has said he will not get into personal arguments with Pep Guardiola next season when they are in charge of Manchester United and Manchester City respectively as it would mean â€œsomeone elseâ€ winning the title. The two have a history of animosity from their time in Spain, when Mourinho was the Real Madrid manager and Guardiola in charge of Barcelona, but Mourinho has said that it would not make sense for either of them to focus on each other. â€œ[What has happened in the past] does not allow me to be innocent. Forâ€‹ two years Pep and I were in a league where the champion would be either me or him, Real Madrid or Barcelona,â€ Mourinho said, speaking in Lisbon, where he was giving a lesson to   on football coaching. â€œIn a situation like this,â€‹ individual fights make sense because they can influence things. [But] in the Premier League, if I focus on him and Manchester City, and he on me and Manchester United, someone else is going to win the league. â€ Mourinho was confirmed as Unitedâ€™s new manager last week  â€”   while Guardiola was announced in February  â€”   and the Portuguese manager is now preparing for his first season in charge at Old Trafford. He is interested in signing Willian from Chelsea and is considering making a formal contract offer for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is a free agent after leaving Paris  . Last week Ibrahimovic was very complimentary about Mourinho  â€”   the two worked together at Internazionale  â€”   but the Portuguese was   when asked about whether the Swede would join him at United next season. â€œMy good friends always rave about me,â€ he said with a smile.

Fu, whose theatrical   interviews have transformed her into a national hero in China, made her remarks on Sunday after her team came in fourth place in the 4x100m medley relay. â€œI donâ€™t think I performed very well today. I feel I let my teammates down,â€ a visibly pained Fu told   CCTV in a brief poolside conversation following the race.  Asked whether she was suffering from stomach pains, the    swimmer said her period had started the previous day. â€œItâ€™s because my period came yesterday, so I felt particularly tired  â€”   but this isnâ€™t an excuse, I still didnâ€™t swim well enough,â€ she said. Chinese sports fans used social media to praise Fu for breaking the silence surrounding the menstrual cycles of female athletes. Many said they had not realised it was possible for a woman to swim during her period. â€œOur Ms Fu dares to say anything,â€ wrote one user of Weibo, Chinaâ€™s Twitter. â€œI really admire Fu Yuanhui for swimming while she was on her period  â€”   women can be affected during their periods, especially with period pain,â€ wrote another, according to the BBC. â€œShe felt guilty for coming fourth, but Fu Yuanhui weâ€™re still very proud of you,â€ the fan added.  A third fan wrote: â€œIt is a normal physiological phenomenon, so why canâ€™t we mention it? Fu Yuanhui is awesome!â€  Eight decades after tampons first went on sale in the United States, a   cultural resistance and inadequate sex education in China are blamed for the fact that only 2% of Chinese women use them, according to one recent study. Chinaâ€™s first domestically produced tampon  â€”   named Crimson Jade Cool  â€”   is set to go on sale soon with the businessman behind the initiative planning to target sport centres for sales.  Fu, who won a bronze medal in the 100m backstroke but is better known for her hilarious,    interviews, has proved a bright spot in a so far disappointing Olympics for China, whose athletes have claimed fewer gold medals than anticipated.  Fuâ€™s viral interviews  â€”   â€œI used all of my mystic energy!â€ she told one journalist to explain a strong performance  â€”   have earned her millions of social media followers and made her a national treasure virtually overnight.  Mark Dreyer, who is tracking Chinaâ€™s Olympic fortunes on the China Sports Insider website  said Fuâ€™s popularity pointed to a healthy shift away from Chinaâ€™s notorious obsession with â€œroboticâ€ gold   athletes. â€œSheâ€™s probably got more name recognition at this point than any of [Chinaâ€™s gold medalists],â€ Dreyer said. â€œPeople are more interested in the personality side of things and the individual side of things rather than, â€˜Here are 50 Chinese robots who are winning for their country and for their Partyâ€™,â€ he added.

politifact13807,https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424/http://uspoln.com:80/2016/11/14/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love,Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”,"A stray bullet fired into a media tent at the equestrian venue and a controlled explosion near the finish line of the road cycling threatened to overshadow the opening day of action at the 2016 Olympics. Even as organisers scrambled to investigate both issues, they were also having to promise to redouble efforts to shift unsold tickets and improve long queueing times amid angry complaints from those who had not been able to enter venues in time to watch the action. While there was an upbeat mood in the city and organisers were pleased with the reaction to Fridayâ€™s opening ceremony, empty seats in many venues and long queues to get into others soon caused frustration and delays. The most dramatic incident of the day came as eyewitnesses reported a bullet from a 5. 56mm assault rifle pierced the roof of the media tent and fell to the floor near a Team GB press officer and a British photographer working for the British Equestrian Foundation. The venue is next door to a media base and there was speculation that it may have accidentally been fired from there. A Rio 2016 spokesman said: â€œWe are aware of the incident and monitoring the investigation by the security forces. No one was hurt. â€ At Copacabana, as crowds gathered to watch the denouement to the menâ€™s cycling road race, there was a brief commotion when bomb control officers arrived suddenly to detonate a suspect package about 150 yards from the finish line. â€œThe security services found a suspicious package   â€¦     and as a precaution decided to perform a controlled explosion,â€ said a Rio 2016 spokesman. Officials said there was no impact on the race, which was at that point only halfway through. The suspect package was believed to be a small bag. On the morning after the opening ceremony the night before, largely well received by the Brazilian media and public, organisers hoped to maintain the momentum. But huge swaths of empty seats visible in the gymnastics, boxing, handball, rugby sevens and hockey arenas as the action got under way detracted from the picture postcard backdrops on show elsewhere. On Copacabana, fans faced huge queues to enter the beach volleyball arena while others waited in line to buy tickets. Meanwhile the action started in front of largely empty stands, although they were much fuller later with Brazilian athletes in action. While some queues were   at others fans became angry at having to endure lengthy security queues. â€œI donâ€™t believe it. Itâ€™s absurd, ridiculous,â€ said Natalia Carvalho, 28, a Rio resident who had wanted to see Brazilian gymnast and medal hopeful Arthur Zanetti compete. Games organisers blamed the situation on a lack of coordination between various groups of security personnel, including the police, Games staff and private security firms. The Rio 2016 director of communications blamed it on the fact â€œthe systems did not talk to each otherâ€. In a later statement, organisers said: â€œWe apologise to any spectators who have had to queue on the first day of competition. We are fully aware of the problem and frustration it causes. We requested that the relevant authorities increase the speed and effectiveness that people can enter the park by requesting more employees to work on the   machines. â€œFollowing improvements the lines returned to normal by  . We appreciate the patience and understanding shown by fans and will use this experience to improve for the forthcoming days of competition. â€ The Deodoro Stadium in the north of the city was almost entirely empty at 11am when rugby returned to the Olympics, except for a few small bands of travelling fans cowering in the shade. But it filled up a little before Brazilâ€™s match against Great Britain, as a few hundred home fans turned out to cheer their team. At the morning swimming heats at the Aquatics Centre on the Olympic Park in Barra, about 20km from central Rio, the stands were roughly a third full. Venues started to fill up as the day went on and in previous Games, notably in Beijing, there have been empty seats in the first few days and stands have become fuller as the fortnight has gone on. But there remains substantial scepticism over the official figure of 80% or 4. 9m, tickets having been sold. As revealed by the Guardian earlier this week, organisers outlined plans to give away ticket to schoolchildren. The first tranche will involve around 240, 000 tickets at less popular sports such as rugby sevens and golf. â€œAs we have already reached 100% of our revenue target, where we have places available for some sessions, we will give the opportunity to students of our education programme, Transforma, volunteers, and other partner projects, as part of our engagement effort,â€ said a spokesman. â€œWe are conducting the first Olympic Games in South America and we want to take this opportunity to bring the sports and the athletes closer to the warmth of the young Brazilians. â€ Organisers have also accelerated their advertising campaign to sell tickets for less popular sports under the slogan â€œThere is emotion in every placeâ€. A spokesman said that there was a daily acceleration in sales and that they were relying on the fact Brazilians traditionally bought tickets at the last minute. However, the website shows that tickets remain available not only for the football and less popular sports but for some of the blue riband events on the track and in the pool.",18,577,"769378838405001216	769548439441072129	769549340163579904	769572113942544389	769582289479020544	769585569584123904	769598502431170561	769598510257754112	769598516280696832	769601257019363329	769631043112534017	769677924278689794	769690387447418880	769692903245479936	769695441550135300	769695998813712384	769714684433879040	769719277230227456	769881479686000641	769894163303243781	769952881323552768	769988686616420352	770209048511651840	770232175702802432	771106674400567296	771922919928827904	772289347974332416	772302619515641856	772453501867855872	772790909557739520	787680995751370752	788704845561733120	796884946375888896	797960365321678848	798003755694297088	798066552906121216	798098121591025668	798172665609498625	798197137058054145	798280536338927616	798284065615056896	798287851653885952	798317758811406337	798334285526798336	798356156552867840	798368741570572288	798398077359050752	798407518829637633	798504374758678528	798547710160830464	798554096093528064	798593626590744577	798701329145364480	798715369649123328	798735345370152960	798763695673196544	798902264022831104	799024838060965889	799089417096982528	799295295423025152	799298819624030210	799306248420147201	824880380524138499	824882859148144640	825098601684688896	825141851443298304	832248517867487232	835133545525960704	835163024935829506	835308615842025472	835337336292507650	835469161329459200	835516414970605568	835537083733274624	835555055415676928	835570138099433472	835580148099465220	835596517524271104	835641851474395136	835647924755398656	835659871206977536	835663917435273220	835676884520292352	835686391627513856	835689546734010369	835696562835763200	835718557476364289	835722697984237568	835724513488752640	835770754004303872	835777985571606528	835783759089844225	835810360724709380	835818870938152961	835840187884261376	835856747432656896	835885730576617472	835889618268618752	835892799195201540	835901523045441536	835903825055780867	835928859384115200	835936064279834624	835943104255414276	835943337827786753	835952301613453314	835954243454582786	835970798582026240	835973155856449538	835974849361244161	835984689835966467	835985543372615680	835989320729186304	835989931151372288	835989952873828353	835991734974877699	835997148105826304	836005271256215552	836016230041534464	836023138425139201	836034539994628101	836036988767715328	836037375075573760	836073609210769408	836146829578416128	836204282470776833	836234863736934404	836257901773717510	836268243710955521	836287878569263105	836293329037963264	836305909483614208	836313059127853057	836315009290539008	836320471301902336	836323181333983238	836347057120165889	836354603780345857	836354632284766209	836354830260187136	836360768585084928	836371317641396224	836383656545562626	836414641274155009	836577106389839873	836589907556642817	836605123853959168	836609698740711425	836612102039089152	836642166189350912	836689332442259456	836689331569872896	836689330601013248	836690030349307904	836690028679987200	836690027799179264	836690033612472321	836690037961965570	836690042152091648	836691075926482946	836695110075232257	836697788138291200	836699757603139585	836708857283948545	836721456859992064	836772989362384897	836778824331223040	836932220757688320	837052689108320256	837076182742990848	837083902137217024	837093381583028224	837418645357723648	841879362316177408	842017477764751360	842029726180995073	842452666118754308	842467594355519489	842475399321903104	907767033613377538	916832406606245888	928715770372263942	944171038933438464",fake

The EPA has been reviewing the lead and copper rule, part of the Safe Drinking Water Act, since roughly 2010. The rule is supposed to ensure high levels of lead donâ€™t seep into drinking water, but has been the subject of criticism for years by scientists who feel it has not adequately protected the public. In response to questions from the Guardian, the agency reiterated it would be 2017 before Americans could expect changes.  â€œIt is shameful EPA has delayed updating the lead and copper rule,â€ Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, told the Guardian.  â€œEPAâ€™s priorities are backwards. They have prioritized ideologically driven regulations, such as Waters of the United States and the Clean Power Plan, instead of updating regulations that ensure Americansâ€™ access to safe drinking water,â€ said Chaffetz, referring to two EPA rule changes that Republicans have argued are overreaches of authority. In memos and emails, EPA scientists claimed that loopholes in the lead and copper rule allowed Flintâ€™s toxic water to go undetected. Physiciansâ€™ groups have also piled on pressure, calling last week for the complete removal of lead from Americaâ€™s plumbing infrastructure.  Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that 33 cities in 17 states used the same testing methods that the EPA scientists warned had initially diminished lead found in Flint. Even when the law is updated, the EPA has not said whether it will outlaw the testing methods it has repeatedly warned against.  The vast majority of lead corrosion occurs after water reaches private property, from lead service lines that connect homes to mains, lead solder in housesâ€™ plumbing, and even from brass faucets, which contained up to 8% lead by weight until 2014. That makes the lead and copper rule unique compared with other testing schemes required of water departments, because samples are taken from residentsâ€™ homes.  Almost since its inception, the regulation endured criticism. In emails and memos, EPA scientists said that loopholes in the law allowed high lead levels in Flint to go undetected. As of May, the cityâ€™s water was still not safe to drink unfiltered.  â€œWe know that there is no safe level of lead consumption, yet 20% of the lead that is ingested comes from the drinking water that flows through lead plumbing in communities across the nation,â€ Dr Andrew W Gurman, incoming president of the American Medical Association, said in June. The group called for a complete removal of all lead service lines and lead plumbing, ongoing testing of water and prompt community notification.  â€œWe must do everything in our power to ensure that another   water crisis never happens again,â€ said Gurman.  One of the most controversial parts of the lead and copper rule is actually only implied.  Because water samples for lead come from peopleâ€™s homes, most water departments ask residents to collect them. Instructions sent by those departments describe how to collect samples. These directions may ask residents to â€œ â€ their taps, run water for a few minutes before a   federally mandated test period, remove small faucet filters called â€œaeratorsâ€ or use   bottles to reduce the flow of water from taps.  All of these methods, the EPA said, can diminish the amount of lead found in tests. The EPA has warned against them and a water scientist in the agency has called their use a â€œserious concernâ€. But none are prohibited by the lead and copper rule.  â€œThe practice of   before collecting compliance samples has been shown to result in the minimization of lead capture and significant underestimate of lead levels in drinking water,â€ wrote Miguel Del Toral, an EPA drinking water scientist, in a memo during the Flint crisis. â€œAlthough this practice is not specifically prohibited by the [lead and copper rule] it negates the intent of the rule to collect compliance samples under â€˜ â€™ conditions. â€œThis is a serious concern,â€ Del Toral continued, â€œas the compliance sampling results which are reported by the City of Flint to residents could provide a false sense of security to the residents of Flint regarding lead levels in the water. â€  Two state officials in Michigan and one Flint official were criminally charged in the lead crisis there, in a warrant that accused the men of tampering with lead tests â€œby directing residents to â€˜ â€™ their taps by running the water for five minutes the night before drawing a water sample   [failing] to collect required samplesâ€ from homes with risky lead service lines. The EPA has warned against   since 2008, when activists discovered the water department in Washington DC added a     to testing instructions four years after its own lead contamination crisis.  â€œIt removes all traces of lead that would come from the lead service line,â€ Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech scientist who uncovered lead contamination in Flint and Washington DC, told the Washington Post in 2008. â€œIf they had used this instruction in 2004, they would have missed the problem,â€ Edwards said.  Activists wrote to the EPAâ€™s office of ground water and drinking water. The then head of the department, Cynthia C Dougherty, responded that while   â€œmay fall within the strict legal interpretation of the regulations, we believe that it goes against the intent of the monitoring protocolâ€. The EPA then forced DCâ€™s water department to stop the practice. Since then, multiple EPA documents, advisory committee white papers and   research by EPA scientists and others have said the practice could diminish lead levels.  Roughly   of all the water departments that responded to the Guardianâ€™s requests for information said they did not   and some water departments abandoned the practice years ago.  Chicago, for instance, stopped telling residents to   taps and remove aerators by 2012. Michigan initially refused to abandon   in June 2015, according to an EPA document, but stopped soon after Flint became national news.  However some water departments, such as Philadelphiaâ€™s, remain opposed to the idea of abandoning  .  The EPA has said it does not collect information on how many water departments might use this practice because states are required to regulate water departments, so there is no national data on how many cities and towns across the US might be affected by such tests. In a statement obtained by the Guardian after the newspaper revealed practices were widespread, the EPA backtracked.  â€œA 2008 letter on   flushing was directed to an individual water utility and was not framed as national guidance,â€ the EPA said following the Guardianâ€™s reporting. â€œThe Lead and Copper Rule does not prohibit practices of   flushing and removal of aerators, but EPAâ€™s February 2016 memorandum reflects the agencyâ€™s recommendations on these practices. â€ The guidance the agency referenced said   may â€œlead to samples that erroneously reflect lower levels of lead concentrationsâ€. â€œIn December 2015, the agency received extensive recommendations from the National Drinking Water Advisory Council and other concerned stakeholders,â€ an EPA spokeswoman said about an outside group of advisers that includes activists and water departments. â€œEPA will carefully evaluate these recommendations, national experience in implementing the rule, and the experience in Flint to develop a proposed revision to the rule. EPA currently expects this proposal to be published for comment in 2017.

politifact13731,http://theseattletribune.com/idaho-mother-sentenced-prison-multiple-citations-public-breastfeeding/,Information for the Nation,"A missing necktie led to Carolina quarterback Cam Newton getting benched for one series on Sunday night. Ron Rivera didnâ€™t expect it to last just one play. One disastrous play that created a most awkward of beginnings, and defined the Panthersâ€™   blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks. â€œWe didnâ€™t lose this game because of a tie,â€ Newton said. â€œIt was a lot of execution errors. Including a lot of things where we had our opportunities and we failed at it. â€ The Panthersâ€™ first offensive play ended up being a pass by Derek Anderson that deflected off Mike Tolbertâ€™s hands and into the arms of linebacker Mike Morgan, but that play didnâ€™t cost Carolina the game. The turnover only led to a field goal for Seattle, but it was the start of an otherwise forgettable performance by the Panthers that provided another blow to the dwindling playoff hopes of the reigning NFC champions. The bigger culprit was the 240 yards rushing allowed by the Panthersâ€™ defense and Carolinaâ€™s inability to finish drives in Seattle territory. Thatâ€™s what turned the seventh meeting in the past five years between the teams into a laugher for the Seahawks. â€œWe just didnâ€™t give ourselves the chance. Thatâ€™s the disappointment,â€ Rivera said. â€œWe had some opportunities. We missed some plays. Probably the toughest thing is the lack of discipline and being where youâ€™re supposed to be. â€ But the flap about the tie and Newtonâ€™s   benching became an overbearing cloud hanging over Carolinaâ€™s performance. â€œI made the decision not to start him after I learned of the infraction,â€ Rivera said. â€œIt was going to be one series. I didnâ€™t anticipate the series lasting one play. â€ Newton was punished because he did not have a necktie for the team flight to Seattle. The Panthers spent the past week in the Bay Area following their game at Oakland and made the trip up the West Coast on Friday. Newton said he realized he hadnâ€™t packed a shirt and tie just before the buses left to take the team to their flight. â€œWe discussed it internally. Me and coach, weâ€™re on the same page, I feel good about it,â€ Newton said. â€œI wore a similar outfit like this before and nothing was done. But he has rules in place and we have to abide by them and no person is greater than the next person. It is what it is. â€ Some teammates, though, didnâ€™t realize the situation until the Panthers took the field and Anderson was calling the first play. Right tackle Trai Turner, playing the position for the first time since high school, said he didnâ€™t know what was going on until the opening play. â€œCoach already addressed it.

politifact14021,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/04/trump-on-revamping-the-military-were-bringing-back-the-draft/,Trump on Revamping the Military: We’re Bringing Back the Draft,"A former senior executive at world boxingâ€™s embattled governing body who was ousted in a bitter power struggle has claimed its president was intimately involved in securing a controversial loan from Azerbaijan. The new claims about the genesis of the deal come amid wider concern over the organisationâ€™s finances and the details of a looming   commercial deal with a Chinese firm. Aiba, the world governing body for amateur boxing and a recipient of millions of pounds in International Olympic Committee funds, negotiated the controversial Azeri loan in 2009. It was alleged by the BBC in 2011 that the deal was linked to a promise to favour Azerbaijani boxers at the London 2012 Games. Aiba has consistently denied there was any link and said earlier this year, after the Guardian revealed fears over a corruption crisis at the Rio Olympics that later led to all 36 judges being suspended pending a continuing investigation, that the loan was in the process of being repaid. Last week the governing body said it was still in discussions with the Azerbaijani investor. Since then a confidential PriceWaterhouseCoopers report compiled in 2015 and seen by the Guardian has revealed a host of financial issues at Aiba related to the loan, including irregularities so serious that the auditor recommended a criminal lawyer be retained by the governing body. Amid a hail of claim and counter claim, Aiba has said the former executive director Ho Kim was solely responsible for the operations of World Series Boxing  â€”   an ambitious attempt to establish a new global tournament between competing franchises  â€”   in America and that he â€œfound the Azeri investor and enjoyed wide discretion in the negotiations and implementation of the transactionâ€. It is believed that Aiba plans to take legal action against Kim in Switzerland, where its headquarters are based, but it is as yet unclear on what grounds. But Kim, who denies any wrongdoing, has now told the Guardian that Dr CK Wu, the controversial president of the amateur world governing body, who is also an IOC executive board member, was intimately involved in signing the deal. â€œA long story to be short, yes, [the] president went to Baku for the final negotiation to sign the investment agreement. After this visit the agreement was signed with the Azeri company based in Switzerland,â€ Ho Kim said. â€œHowever, later Azerbaijan could not do this way and changed the agreement by investing directly from Azerbaijan  â€”   we had to sign the agreement again. Yes, [the] president was involved [in] all negotiations and progresses from the start to the end of this deal. â€ Documents seen by the Guardian, including a letter from Dr Wu to the Azerbaijani minister of emergency situations, Kamaladdin Heydarov, in August 2010 appear to back up the claim that the president was closely involved in negotiating the loan. In the letter, in which Dr Wu appears to mention meeting the minister (who is also head of the Azerbaijan boxing federation) in Baku the previous month, he asks Heydarov to finalise the payment as soon as he can. The details of the letter also appear to raise questions over the conclusions of Aibaâ€™s own internal review, which concluded in December 2011 that the loan came from a private sector investor, about the extent of the governmentâ€™s involvement. In a statement to the Guardian Aiba again insisted it was Kim who was chiefly responsible for negotiating the loan and for how it was spent. â€œWe confirm that Ho Kim found the investor and enjoyed wide discretion in the negotiation and in the implementation of the transaction. Significantly Mr Kim signed alone the first Memorandum of Understanding that eventually led to the loan,â€ said a spokesman. â€œThis loan was arranged for a separate legal entity from Aiba, WSB America Operations SA, which was operated solely by Mr Kim. The loan was expected to be used to help grow boxing in North America under Mr Kimâ€™s responsibility. Mr Kim was the sole board member not only of WSB America Operations SA but also of all its affiliates. â€ Kim denied that he was responsible for any accounting irregularities. Kim, who alleges that Dr Wu was personally involved in the loan and employed a consultant to act as his â€œeyes and earsâ€ in America, was acrimoniously ousted in 2015 to be replaced as executive director by Karim Bouzidi. The Guardian can reveal that Bouzidi has now also left the governing body after his role was â€œreassignedâ€ in the summer at the height of the controversy over claims of judging corruption. Bouzidi has not yet commented publicly about his position. Kim also spoke in detail about a $10m loan he and Dr Wu solicited from a Kazakhstani investor and a Chinese investor, Di Wu, who discussed lending 35m Swiss francs ($34. 9m) and is said to have eventually invested around half that amount. Aibaâ€™s critics believe the rush to conclude a     commercial deal with AliSports, a division of the Chinese giant AliBaba, is partly due to the urgency in repaying the various loans and part of an attempt by Dr Wu to entrench his powerbase before a special congress he has called next month. Aiba denies the proceeds from the Chinese deal will be used to repay the Azerbaijan loan. Wuâ€™s current term as president runs out in 2018. Some insiders believe he is looking for ways to extend that tenure, others that he will give the new Chinese investors greater influence. Some in the boxing world fear that the Chinese firm will be given unprecedented influence over the future of the sport. In response to questions from the Guardian, Aiba insisted the deal  â€”   which it is understood will give AliSports a 67% stake in a new   joint venture in return for an   investment of around 110m Swiss francs ($109m)  â€”   was purely a commercial one and had nothing to do with repaying outstanding loans. â€œThe two entities are close to reaching a final agreement. Details will be announced shortly,â€ a spokesman said. â€œThis agreement has nothing to do with the repayment of the said loan you mention. It is a   partnership which will benefit our sport and its boxers. The Joint Venture with Alisports will focus essentially on the commercial and marketing rights of boxing. The governance of boxing remains under the attributes of Aiba. â€ Negotiations over the Chinese deal are believed to be close to a conclusion and some Aiba executives and national boxing federations are currently in St Petersburg for the Youth World Boxing Championships. In the wake of the scandal in Rio, when the Guardianâ€™s warnings about fears of corruption among concerned senior Aiba insiders were followed by a global outcry during the Olympics and the suspension of all 36 officials afterwards  â€”   pending investigation  â€”   there were calls for more transparency and a comprehensive overhaul of Aibaâ€™s governance. Those loyal to Dr Wu insist his recent actions  â€”   including an internal review into the judging claims  â€”   prove that he is serious about cleaning up the sport and that the Chinese deal is part of a plan to put it on an even keel financially. They claim that Ho Kim is a bitter   and that his account is therefore compromised. However, Dr Wuâ€™s long list of critics believe the opposite is true and that the   president is increasingly desperate to find a quick fix to the mounting financial and organisational problems by sealing the AliBaba deal before Decemberâ€™s special congress in order to cling on to power. Under Wu a series of increasingly ambitious schemes to expand Aibaâ€™s influence  â€”   including WSB and the Boxing Marketing Arm  â€”   have combined with a push to allow professionals into the Olympics and the rejection of headguards to make its competitions more attractive. But   insiders alleged they also coincided with financial and organisational chaos that left Aiba unable to function effectively. An Aiba spokesman reiterated that it had commissioned the PWC report itself to try to get to the bottom of where the Azerbaijan loan had gone and planned to take further action. â€œWe would like to underline that in the draft PWC report you mentioned and which was circulated illegally, much of the findings require further investigation,â€ he said. â€œThis is why Aiba â€”  who has taken the initial step of commissioning the report and is addressing the contents of the report in a serious manner â€”  has requested an additional report to confirm the financial discrepancies found in the initial report. â€",923,372,"726035905245417473	765299584801251328	765815867368169472	772838193787961348	773787393195323392	773860832346124288	774727049600786432	775380352995033088	775633018090250240	775705156323278849	775720311677456384	775720451414847488	775721009672556544	777281359186362369	777281655853678593	777281854621806592	777282130942496768	777905906596057088	777906545594134528	777906788301737985	778232099794976770	778232213238386689	778232249103818752	778272785177149440	778272836758671361	778273090086244352	778274563054526464	778274720517070848	778596203109941248	778597441037828096	778605282322706432	778605669771608064	778978352707342336	778979062035390468	778979177433329665	778979279933702144	778996984267083776	778997158829850624	778997345505648640	778997497821818880	778997634556108801	778997779603611648	778997819432730624	779284112729333760	779285844733595648	779286071494451200	779308451105210368	779308746573045760	779309116917485568	779309228582371328	779309271242645504	779318876802875392	779373425982832640	779373478248116224	779373535764570113	779373641519788033	779373686478479361	779373731655327744	779373805898756096	779373900790697984	779373940330356736	779374401846378497	779374500861321216	779374614875078656	779374663143133184	779400505873268736	779401840500830208	779422794488709121	779422846888112128	779423731538128896	779425074088730625	779684488506933248	779685769103478784	779685902079684608	779685948548407296	779685992622088193	779686030442127360	779769152663875585	779769384638218242	779769521758437380	779769564859105280	779769802466422784	779770213499826176	779831058992861184	779831165465268224	779831356360650752	779831426787188736	779831602113351681	780113059830456320	780420782123995140	780436246011125760	780436282908352512	780445339631443968	780445425006473216	780445484796243968	780445539523584004	780445897977171968	781206075685175296	781208339481038848	786740782854238208	791756549731397632	793464066639552513	794978521944883203	794979603555188736	795025234248273920	795578626531987456	796311258899369984	796432912086278145	796445283710169088	796821243705995264	797605537756151808	797758891996102660	797934460603797506	797943095794860032	797943396018962434	797945584724258816	798021887552933888	798264922580860928	798273706267181056	798489413969854464	798502647368065026	798506993543626752	798518890582183936	798572164463071232	798600727891505152	798703162970537984	798753098000797696	798753241185927168	798756214947520513	798758731957702657	798779506316091392	798983469745381376	799687002073563136	800148795119923200	800776956140785665	802263008353210368	804638294881378306	807331106471243777	808579279508348928	809954716608241669	810500233868283905	811351320510623746	813094012311760897	814998544155283456	820520492134264834	824897729872617472	825458601842077696	829733013311389696	850512431986200579	850690671014969344	851408686434189312	851540676558729216	851549503899357184	851549589328936961	851644042802864128	852982411537260544	853076140377899008	853392137093652481	853653900334739457	853675408172216321	853753250734002176	853807828754149376	853906309812441090	853951316808409089	853972969969856512	853990023124922368	854056135048953856	854070829620920320	854390369903095810	854888077487202304",fake
politifact15579,https://conservativedailypost.com/us-representatives-promise-implement-of-un-gun-control-plans/,US Representatives Promise Implement Of UN Gun-Control Plans,"Prominent figures from the football world, including a former manager described as still working â€œin the senior echelonsâ€ of the sport, have repeatedly been named by some of the players alleging sexual abuse in the escalating crisis that has also led to new claims about a number of clubs, not just Chelsea, paying off victims with hush money. Lawyers representing a new independent body, the Offside Trust, that has been set up to help the victims and their families described it as â€œextremely worryingâ€ that, only three days after its formation, there had already been numerous   accounts from former and current professional footballers directly implicating people who were still involved in the game and â€œneed further investigationâ€. Other victims have informed the trust they were offered large sums of money as long as they signed confidentiality agreements to prevent the clubs suffering damaging publicity, in the same way that Chelsea paid Â£50, 000 to their former player Gary Johnson in an attempt to stifle the allegations against Eddie Heath, a scout for the London club in the 1970s. Chelsea issued an apology over the weekend but Ed Smethurst, representing Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, the two players whose interviews in the Guardian opened what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis he has ever known within the sport, said there was already clear information that other clubs had been part of similar  . Asked how many clubs he was referring to, he said it was â€œless than fiveâ€ but also reiterated that the trust had been operating only since Friday. â€œIt is unfurling as we speak,â€ he said. Smethurst went on to say there were grave misgivings about the FAâ€™s independent inquiry, pointing out that â€œa lot of people have come forward who have said they donâ€™t have trust the establishmentâ€ but his most alarming revelation was that some of the people identified as offenders were still working within the sport. â€œThere are certain names who do come up repeatedly,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m not going to divulge specifics but there are absolutely people in the game today who victims have spoken to me about. There are specific allegations against specific individuals, many of whom have been rumoured to be involved for a very long period of time, some of whom still work in the senior echelons of football, and itâ€™s extremely worrying. â€ Smethurst described it as a â€œtidal waveâ€ of calls since Woodward spoke to this newspaper and was asked about the fact that some of the coaches who had previously been under suspicion were still working in football. â€œIs it a surprise? No. There are other individuals in the game, past and present, where further action could, and should, have been taken,â€ he said. The latest police figures, issued last Thursday, stated that around 350 alleged victims had made official complaints. Those involved 55 clubs, at professional and amateur level, but the players who have driven the campaign are aware of many others with similar stories who do not want to go public. â€œIâ€™ve had about 50 different   who have contacted me to say things have happened to them,â€ Walters said. â€œAndy has had a similar number of calls. Some have told me theyâ€™ve been groomed, others had a certain level of abuse, some are horrific stories. Itâ€™s  . I had one call on the way here today. There are so many more. Iâ€™m getting phone calls every day. You wont believe how many are still to come out. â€ Walters, sitting next to Woodward at an emotional press conference to launch the trust, added: â€œFair play to Chelsea  â€”   itâ€™s too little, too late, but they have put their apology out there in a sincere manner. Other clubs, though, have got their heads in the sand. These children trusted them and the clubs have let everyone down. â€ Two individuals who previously worked together at the same club have repeatedly been named  â€”   one no longer in employment  â€”   and Smethurst said some of the players making complaints felt unable to waive their anonymity. â€œUnless youâ€™ve been a victim of something like this I think itâ€™s very difficult for an outsider to understand. Some want to talk about it, but donâ€™t necessarily want the furore. They might not want their parents or children to know, or they might think that there is nothing they can do about it, or that it might be swept under the carpet. â€ The FA has appointed a QC, Kate Gallafent, to oversee its investigation but some of the victims have questioned whether it can truly be considered an independent inquiry if the governing body is paying the person investigating its own role. Smethurst, working on a pro bono basis for the trust as managing director of the Manchester firm Prosperity Law, made the same point and encouraged other players to come forward even if they had agreed payments from clubs to remain silent. â€œCertainly, allegations have been made by victims that confidentiality clauses have been used in relation to other clubs,â€ he said. â€œIt does happen. I canâ€™t speak about what Chelseaâ€™s lawyers advised them but, from a campaigning perspective, we think some things are so important  â€”   the protection of children for one  â€”   that clubs should not hush these things up and tie victims up in confidentiality. â€œThere is a wider perspective here about the protection of the victim and stopping these things from reoccurring. Itâ€™s often the case if there is an abuser that there are other people who know, or who have turned a blind eye, so I would say even if the person is dead I would not encourage the use of confidentiality. â€",674,209,"1014937824242651136	1014938050655289344	1014938174555086848	1014938369812357120	1014938435843289088	1014941607076999168	1014947409321971712	1014950501379649538	1014951230660136962	1014956919625342976	1015060758361567232	1015272171550191622	1015304274409148417	1015304517007618048	1015323087582179328	1015930616355917825	1016005927122669568	1016206667027922946	1016436292668788736",fake
politifact15342,https://yournewswire.com/bill-gates-doctor-vaccinate/,Bill Gates’ Former Doctor Says Billionaire ‘Refused To Vaccinate His Children’,"The ceasefire in Syria may not have been formally pronounced dead, but hopes to resurrect it are fast dwindling. After an aid convoy was destroyed near Aleppo, fighting again intensified and the US and Russia exchanged accusations in the UN. But in reality US diplomacy had collapsed before these latest events. Last week, just hours after western coalition airstrikes mistakenly targeted Syrian government forces, killing more than 60 people, the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, made an extraordinary statement that served to highlight the contradictions at the heart of the Obama administration. Power lambasted Russiaâ€™s â€œuniquely cynical and hypocritical stuntâ€ for having convened an emergency UN security council meeting over the bombing of Syrian troops. She lashed out at how Russia had, over the past five years, consistently propped up the Assad regime and protected it from any consequences of its murderous policies. At length, she described Bashar  â€™s strategy of â€œdeath by a thousand paper cutsâ€: starvation sieges the â€œhorrifying, predictable regularityâ€ of strikes on civilian targets the â€œroutineâ€ use of chemical weapons and â€œtorture chambersâ€ holding â€œtens of thousands of peopleâ€. Why, she asked, had Russia never once called an urgent security council meeting over such horrors? There have long been two takes on Syria. One is the geopolitical realism line, which Barack Obama has chosen to follow largely because it fits with his reluctance to get involved in another war. The line is that US or western security interests are not at stake in an intractable,   civil war that can more easily be contained than solved. The other is the moral imperative line that Power has repeatedly advocated within the administration. It refers to the doctrine of â€œresponsibility to protectâ€ according to which a stateâ€™s sovereignty can be violated when a regime slaughters its own citizens. Power published a book in 2002, A Problem from Hell, describing how US governments had historically failed to prevent genocides and mass atrocities  â€”   the book reportedly drew Obamaâ€™s attention to her when he was a senator. The differences between Power and Obama were apparent in her stinging UN statement. By contrast, Obama said little on Syria in his UN speech this week. In his 2009 Nobel prize speech, Obama said that inaction in the face of mass slaughter â€œtears at our conscience and can lead to most costly intervention laterâ€. As Syria turned into hell on earth, the president repeatedly made the case that any intervention would be either futile or dangerous. In tune with the American publicâ€™s aversion to military involvement after the disastrous Bush years, his policies have ranged from attempts to negotiate Assadâ€™s physical departure from Syria (a plan dubbed the Yemeni scenario in 2012) to creating a â€œhubâ€ in Turkey where rebels would be armed and trained (but without   or   weaponry) and  â€”   once Russiaâ€™s military intervention was launched in 2015  â€”   more intense diplomacy with Moscow. Results have been scant. What seems to have been missing from the US calculus, and what Powerâ€™s comments have perhaps unwillingly underscored, is that so many signs point to a crude reality: that Assad and his backer, Vladimir Putin, arenâ€™t just indifferent to crimes against humanity but believe they serve their purpose. Assad warned back in 2011 that he would spread chaos throughout Syria and beyond if calls for him to step down werenâ€™t retracted. Putin has constructed his whole domestic political narrative around the notion that, however much he may be criticised by the west, he has restored Russiaâ€™s strength. Nor is Putin much bothered by the crimes of the Assad regime  â€”   his own army carried out similar massacres in Chechnya. Itâ€™s possible Powerâ€™s statement was aimed at western public opinion rather than at the autocrats who, time and again, have demonstrated their capacity to order or tolerate untold levels of violence against civilians. As his presidency comes to a close, the fact is that Obama has little to show the world on Syria. With an estimated half a million deaths, the Middle East in flames and European allies destabilised by the impact of refugee flows, he will pass on a festering crisis to his successor. Russia was always going to be a stumbling block, not least because Putin long ago identified Obamaâ€™s reluctance to do more  â€”   such as arming the rebels decisively, upholding his   â€œred lineâ€ or setting up a   zone (before Russian intervention made that impossible). There is a long list of missed opportunities that might have forced Assad to the negotiating table. Earlier this year the Atlantic magazine  quoted Obama saying of Putin: â€œThe notion that somehow Russia is in a stronger position now than before he had to deploy military forces to Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs. â€ Yet today Putin does appear stronger, if only because the US finds itself scrambling to salvage the ceasefire deal without any leverage. Trying to blame and shame Russia over the UN convoy bombing is unlikely to achieve much on its own. A key problem with the ceasefire deal was the plan to set up a   â€œjoint implementation centreâ€ to coordinate strikes against Islamic State. This was meant as an incentive, as Putin had long sought to be accepted as a coalition partner alongside the United States. But if implemented, such a coalition could make the US complicit in Russian airstrikes, which have been designed to strengthen Assad. The US would endorse a Russian intervention premised on the notion that there are only two actors in Syria: Assad and the jihadis. Yet as Power pointed out, â€œthe Syrian government, which bills itself as a fighter against terrorists, allows Isis to grow and grow and grow   â€¦     Assadâ€™s antics  â€”   his tactics, his strategy  â€”   have been a gift to terrorists in Syria and well beyondâ€. By siding with Russia, the US would risk offering another gift to terrorists. Of course, American policymakers were well aware of this, which is why they set preconditions: a partial freezing of the civil war, and safe passage for humanitarian aid deliveries to Aleppo, the armed oppositionâ€™s last stronghold. But appealing to Putinâ€™s sense of decency to get Assad to curtail his bombing was always going to be a gamble. Why would Putin seek to please the US once he had become an equal player alongside the sole global power? Obama has been in a hurry to reach a breakthrough on Syria these past few months, because heâ€™s leaving office. Putin certainly isnâ€™t. Nor is he constrained by domestic public opinion to do the right thing, or even try to. The Obama administration is hanging on to the last shreds of its ceasefire plan  â€”   for lack of an alternative, though its critics would do well to avoid schadenfreude. With   terrorism spreading in many parts of the world and illiberalism growing in Europe on the back of the refugee crisis, Syria has become a security threat well beyond the Middle East. Against that backdrop, geopolitical realism and moral imperatives look less like opposites. Assad is capitalising on the balance of forces Russia has helped create. This in turn  â€”   as Power has said  â€”   will fuel Isis, whose twisted claim is to be the champion of Sunni Muslims. This means more problems lie ahead for the west, and more suffering for the Syrians. Meanwhile, Putin is celebrated by populists around the world for having outmanoeuvred the US by pulling himself up to the ranks of a leader whose cooperation is almost begged for. Russia may be in recession, and its economy the size of Australiaâ€™s, but in Syria it has been given a free hand. Whatever one may think of American power and its limits, and however one may choose to gauge Syriaâ€™s importance to narrowly defined US national security interests, history will remember that this all happened under Obamaâ€™s watch. A former adviser to Bill Clinton once reflected on how the US had failed to prevent massacres in Bosnia: he said that by 1995, â€œthe issue had become a cancer on our foreign policy and on his administrationâ€™s leadershipâ€. For this reason, Clinton in the end ordered targeted strikes on Serbian forces, which forced Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡ to the negotiating table. Power, who covered that crisis as a journalist, eloquently told the story in her book. No doubt Syria is a complex, multifaceted war, on a different scale to Bosnia. But the lesson that should still be drawn is that war diplomacy can only succeed if leverage is decisively built up, not just hoped for.

When I started working on freedom of expression some years ago, I never imagined that threats to it in the university itself would become such a hot topic. But today, a great debate about this is echoing across the   world. The dean of students at the University of Chicago recently wrote to inform all new students that: â€œWe do not support   trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own. â€ And a mighty row erupted when the University of Cape Town rescinded (quite wrongly, in my view) a lecture invitation to Flemming Rose, the journalist who commissioned the Danish cartoons of Muhammad. On Wednesday, the prime minister, Theresa May, condemned the idea of safe spaces in answer to a parliamentary question. Yet the main reason British universities have been wrestling with the issue of free speech is the duty imposed on them by the governmentâ€™s   legislation Prevent  â€”   introduced by the Home Office while she was home secretary, which in its outrageous original version asked academics to be spies on, and censors of, even   â€œextremismâ€ (never properly defined). So she May be for free speech, or May be not. One trouble with this debate is that the important and sometimes difficult balancing judgments that should be its focus are obscured by the silliness, hyperbole and hysteria that accompany it like the raucous camp followers of a medieval army. It also comes with a whole new jargon: trigger warnings, safe spaces,   microaggressions. And it is highly politicised. At this yearâ€™s Republican convention in Ohio, speaker after speaker garnered a surefire round of applause by attacking â€œpolitical correctnessâ€. No one had to explain what they meant: just spit out the two words and trigger the Pavlovian response. But what might loosely be called the other side is often its own worst enemy. The New York Times recently reported a presentation to new students by the chief diversity officer at Clark University. Among her examples of microaggressions to be avoided, she included saying â€œyou guysâ€ since the phrase could be interpreted as excluding women. One female Hispanic student, who had repeatedly committed this heinous error, commented gratefully: â€œThis helped me see that Iâ€™m a microaggressor too. â€ What a dreary, anxious, puritanical kindergarten a campus would become if students were constantly worrying whether this or that word might cause offence to someone or other. But having spent many hours discussing these issues with students and colleagues, I think we need to make a few distinctions. For a start, peaceful if provocative student activism around the renaming of buildings, statues, titles, curriculums and so on is not usually a threat to free speech, and can be an enhancement of it. Alumni may chunter against the political correctness of the Rhodes Must Fall movement at Oxford, and threaten to withdraw their donations, but if student activism has contributed to Georgetown Universityâ€™s admirable attempt to make amends for having used and sold slaves in the early 19th century, that is surely a good thing. Interestingly, some younger scholars at Oxford are initiating a similar discussion around the Codrington library at All Souls College. (Christopher Codrington was a slave owner.) A Chicago student defends trigger warnings against the deanâ€™s criticism, saying they simply involve a professor warning his class that, for example, the reading for this week includes a graphic description of sexual assault. In principle, thatâ€™s hardly an infringement of free speech. After all, weâ€™re used to television news anchors saying that the next item contains images that some viewers may find disturbing. Some of the suggested trigger warnings  â€”   on Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses, for example  â€”   are absurdly over the top, and we do need to watch out for a creeping chilling effect, but in moderation, where reasonably called for, why not? The same student explains safe spaces as areas on campus where â€œstudents  â€”   especially but not limited to those who have endured trauma or feel marginalised  â€”   can feel comfortable talking about their experiencesâ€ and gives the example of a Hillel House for Jewish students. Now if that is all it means, this can also be an enhancement of free speech: people may speak more freely when they feel among their own and, since it involves no compulsion of others, they should be free subjectively to define â€œtheir ownâ€. (Whether the safe space idea extends to privileged white men, of the kind known in England as Hooray Henrys, is an interesting question.) But this is not how the slogan of safe spaces is often used in British and American universities. Rather, the suggestion is that the whole university or college should be a safe space. I have several times heard British students say that to invite a fascist or transphobic speaker to their college is like â€œhaving them in your living roomâ€. Here, anyone who believes that free speech is vital to a university must draw the line. For what these student activists are claiming when they insist that, for example, Germaine Greer may not speak on a particular campus (because of her view that a woman is not â€œa man without a cockâ€) is that one group of students has the right to prevent another group of students hearing a speaker whom the second group actually wants to hear. Such   is, in effect,    censorship. It is an abuse of language to suggest that anyone can seriously be â€œunsafeâ€ because someone whose views they find offensive or upsetting is speaking in a room on the other side of campus. In fact, one underexamined question is precisely this: what kind of space is a university? And the answer, which also explains some of the confusion, must be: several different kinds of space, which should have different standards. Thus, no one should be obliged to have Donald Trump in their dorm, or as a special guest at the Hispanic social night. Nor would I want to see him as a lecturer in political science, let alone on race relations. But I would want to see him invited to speak at a student debating society, where Iâ€™m sure the other speakers and student audience would subject him to a   roasting. I think itâ€™s fair to say that the erosion of free speech is still only at the margins in major western universities, and mainly concerns a few particular subjects. But we must always watch out for the thin end of the wedge, whether it is being pushed by student activists or government. Thatâ€™s why I drafted, together with Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions and now head of an Oxford college, a statement on free speech that is now on Oxford Universityâ€™s website and has been formally adopted by a number of its colleges. â€œFree speech is the lifeblood of a university,â€ it begins, going on to observe that â€œinevitably, this will mean that members of the university are confronted with views that some find unsettling, extreme or offensive. The university must therefore foster freedom of expression within a framework of robust civility. â€ To many, this may seem like a statement of the  . But there are times when a fundamental liberal position needs to be stated explicitly, and these are such times.",121,685,"952672362381504512	952672459056140289	952672988196843520	952675392921387009	952677118885822464	952682876889391105	952690575387561984	952691683035987968	952695576096858112	952695587912155136	952701936129728512	952714136919642113	952737356414574592	952743734151667714	952757204611977216	952773889079238656	952782071503769602	952815327049601024	952819830654152704	952820608164880384	952838450188881920	952874125634260995	952875800704925696	952901460198600706	952910824947011584	952919150506147842	952927162692198400	952929558256381952	952930492076224512	952933480345817089	952953438098276352	952953959769030656	952958792135720960	953034096548003840	953057018750914560	953058760607567873	953063330444431360	953088699952181248	953177696925777920	953293035139424257	953294503686832129	953644068789211137	954476310897635328	956147689397407746	958391392992194562",fake

Thielâ€™s   David Sacks, a Stanford and Paypal alumnus along with Thiel, also apologised after the Guardian reported on the bookâ€™s contents on Friday. Thiel gave a statement to Forbes magazine, which said: â€œMore than two decades ago, I   a book with several insensitive, crudely argued statements. As Iâ€™ve said before, I wish Iâ€™d never written those things. Iâ€™m sorry for it. Rape in all forms is a crime. I regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest otherwise. â€ Thiel had not responded to a request for comment to the Guardian. Thiel made his fortune as a   of PayPal, which increased markedly after an early investment in Facebook. He now sits on the board of the company, and has attracted notoriety after donating $1. 25m (Â£1m) to Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign. In the 1995 book, The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, Thiel and Sacks wrote of Stanfordâ€™s sexual assault policies: â€œIt is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks. â€œBut since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might â€˜realiseâ€™ that she had been â€˜rapedâ€™ the next day or even many days later. Under these circumstances, it is unclear who should be held responsible. If the alcohol made both of them do it, then why should the womanâ€™s consent be obviated any more than the manâ€™s? Why is all blame placed on the man?â€ Sacks, who is now the chief executive of Human Resources startup Zenefits, told Recode: â€œThis is college journalism written over 20 years ago. It does not represent who I am or what I believe today. Iâ€™m embarrassed by some of my former views and regret writing them. â€ The book has proven endlessly controversial since its publication, with Thiel already apologising for some of its contents once before: in 2011, he expressed regret for writing about an incident in which a future PayPal executive, Keith Rabois, stood outside the house of a Stanford staff member shouting â€œFaggot! Faggot! Hope you die of Aids! â€. Rabois had hoped to provoke discussion of free speech, and the subsequent anger was compared by Thiel and Sacks to the Salem Witch Trials, Orwellâ€™s 1984, and the Spanish Inquisition.",246,709,"939259644173791232	939259710368354304	939260113994637317	939260699213213701	939260948820377602	939261050603655169	939261239779262466	939261604327194632	939261821202165766	939261868320882688	939261905058893824	939262037456068608	939263435312979968	939263603697377280	939263873521201152	939264091566129152	939265079735812096	939265117665062913	939265963786039296	939266105528504321	939266962034606080	939267002023206912	939267408585469952	939267598692298752	939268114520444929	939268183331966976	939269179915554816	939269524267745280	939269630258024448	939269752257765377	939269813930639360	939271057222938624	939271175204569089	939271272671956992	939271670388359168	939272055047979008	939272791718756352	939274081177874439	939274124123283456	939274187159560192	939274390629429250	939274395385675777	939274489149382656	939274658226032640	939275428740595712	939275543106568192	939275781464903680	939276175897067520	939276203525058560	939276400036646913	939276972584259584	939277142428409856	939277382954995715	939278226408591361	939278830283493377	939279200493670400	939279418278555648	939279735816970240	939280589294854144	939280961874812929	939281299424010240	939281458136363008	939281494048165893	939282726095589376	939283229969993728	939283890644094977	939284047502639104	939286129521565697	939286155962519554	939286260107173889	939286874170052610	939286886425726976	939288850655883264	939289506456522752	939290261070508033	939290914702336000	939291911579254789	939292372827066371	939292424224075776	939292719419199489	939292770287734784	939292802445389825	939292977981284352	939293170826915840	939295452075319297	939295616676622337	939296584491261953	939296691735355392	939297500321722368	939299373871259649	939299635553886208	939301473879334912	939304750620790784	939306111441756163	939311169973768192	939311280703275008	939312112819634176	939313604146348032	939314958835204096	939315590417797121	939316934952153088	939318152269352962	939321384152559621	939322827869687808	939322958920781824	939322989367250944	939327690796134400	939328228178534400	939331963760054272	939336690534977536	939340509247553537	939343633274114049	939345361532891136	939345856746029058	939346979703939072	939358498474803200	939359573390979072	939364196302704640	939375335568576512	939382622370672640	939414493167280128	939421876618715137	939422001479016448	939442971396771840	939443857002868737	939454068925304833	939461897593737218	939467320614965248	939474969934880768	939478659534073856	939478915055222784	939484245881372673	939491464563830784	939497787237867520	939501639194566656	939502113935319041	939527064868343808	939536788292595713	939539032861790209	939544051526787073	939545999286132738	939548396712611840	939572896451702784	939574905393242112	939580928069918723	939603136792084480	939605691660193797	939609133480906752	939618240065454080	939635795618684928	939692157446656000	939848075203330049	939848809076740096	939857254668537856	939866176733241344	939877857299501056	939877924647395331	939880589703962626	939880905908408320	939881393252896768	939882767558500352	939884586590461952	939884745881739264	939885812765802496	939896489383481349	939900117619941381	939901402192650240	939915583612702720	939930748630396928	939931890882170882	939954058626035713	939955172364578816	939961325639184384	939965212970565632	940021807947563008	940040264063660033	940077881731956736	940085846719438848	940111799382192128	940346742922469376	942439417683292167",fake

The   currently has his 47th feature, CafÃ© Society, doing solid business in cinemas, and is already at work on a   feature, starring Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake. Up next, however, is his   television show: Crisis in Six Seasons. Not much was known about the   series Allen scripted and directed for Amazon until Sunday, when the first preview screened during the Television Critics Association panel in Los Angeles, and a plot synopsis was made available. As shown by the footage, which showcases Allen at his neurotic best as a Jewish novelist named Sidney Muntzinger, Crisis in Six Seasons is a period piece set in the swinging 60s, when â€œAmerican society is brought to verge of revolutionâ€. The show is said to center on a   suburban family visited by a guest who turns their household completely upside down, likely to be played by Miley Cyrus, who the director cast as his leading lady in January. Comedy legend Elaine May also stars, but her role is also unknown. The footage is drolly funny, which bodes well for the show. It sees Muntzinger requesting his barber (Vinylâ€™s Max Casella) to â€œtake a little bit off the topâ€ to make him resemble James Dean. â€œI canâ€™t make you look like James Dean,â€ the barber says   . â€œI can work on your hair for 10 years and youâ€™re never going to look like James Dean. â€ The barber then proceeds to criticize Muntzingerâ€™s latest â€œnovellaâ€ telling the author it put him to sleep.  The show debuts on Amazon Prime Video on 30

politifact15207,https://me.me/i/laguna-beach-antifa-lagbeachantifa9-22m-david-hogg-didnt-attend-parkland-20703986,Laguna Beach Antifa 22m David Hogg Didn't Attend Parkland High School I Went to School With Him at Redondo Shores High School in California and He Graduated in 2015 Here He Is in Our Yearbook From 201,"A recent newspaper cover of Die Zeit featured a wrenching story about the 880 refugees who, on a single week in May, went to their deaths in the Mediterranean. It contrasted the increasingly hardline politicians of EU nations, in particular the rising Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland party, with the rescuers who had to fish bodies from the sea with nets. It described a couple whose corpses were found arm in arm, and a baby with blue lips and shrivelled feet. I read this story on the morning of the opening of the Berlin Biennale, whose main exhibition site features a juice bar, a giant cutout poster of Rihanna, and a poster reading: â€œWhy should fascists have all the fun?â€ Welcome to the LOL biennial. And brace yourselves. The reins of one of Europeâ€™s most significant art showcases, now in its ninth edition, have been handed over to the New York fashion collective known as DIS, who have never put together an exhibition before. The DIS foursome  â€”   Lauren Boyle, Solomon Chase, Marco Roso and David Toro  â€”   donâ€™t aspire to be curators. Instead they manage an online magazine, photo service and other digital enterprises celebrate the middlebrow and the ornery and revel in sponsorships and branding opportunities that efface any distinction between creation and complicity. And what they have produced, at this moment of political revanchism and humanitarian crisis, is an     biennial, replete with ads, avatars, custom security guard uniforms, a manic social media presence disposed to hashtags like #BiennaleGlam, and a woman lip syncing to Trap Queen. Stick with it across five sites  â€”   an art academy, management school, Kunsthalle, private collection, and a tourist boat upholstered in fake fur and fire prints  â€”   and you will find a few things to like. One of the strongest works in the show comes from CÃ©cile B Evans, an American artist living between London and Berlin, whose immersive video installation What the Heart Wants offers a rare dose of ambition and seriousness.  In a huge underground gallery, a watery garden traversed by a runway forms the backdrop for a grim but sensitive vision of the near future, in which life is lived somewhere between a server farm and a   global  . Lovers achingly remember a society populated by real bodies disembodied ears float in   deserts. Evans imagines the end of the world as routed through an Aaliyah video, in which love itself has been commoditised, and slickness is no escape from psychological or ecological meltdown. Every artist here has Evansâ€™s easy command of digital media almost none display the same gravity or care. The biennial groans with imitations, parodies, deceptions, knockoffs, pairing   visions with sniggering jokes. Timur   offers up a terrarium equipped with vapid   like â€œNew Peaceâ€ and â€œMirrorscapeâ€ (the commons is being privatised  â€”   LOL). The aforementioned juice bar comes from DÃ©bora Delmar, a Mexican artist who styles herself as â€œDebora Delmar Corpâ€ and whose bottles of green gunk are accompanied by an ad campaign that pitches   through consumption (health neuroses are big business  â€”   LOL).  A   installation by Christopher Kulendran Thomas places the history of ethnic cleansing in Sri Lanka into a real estate showroom (genocide  â€”   LOL). In front of a window on to Pariser Platz  â€”   filled on the day I visited with a grab bag of protesters  â€”   a callow statue by the Swedish artist Anna Uddenberg depicts a young woman in a thong who is taking a picture of her ass with a selfie stick. From the Pergamon to this in 2, 000 years. These artists seem to want to have their fun and still get credit for topicality, but letâ€™s get real: I have seen spambots with greater sensitivity. Images and ideas appear here as one big   and everything gets absorbed into the DISosphere, a feeble blancmange of logos and light boxes. Numerous artistsâ€™ contributions, such as a    crowd scene shot by Anne de Vries, are indistinguishable from DISâ€™s own impostures. These include those â€œWhy should fascists have all the fun. ..?â€ ads, hung in one case across the street from a former Jewish girlsâ€™ school. (In an interview, the campaignâ€™s art director Babak Radboy justifies that disgusting slogan by claiming we should â€œlearn fromâ€ Donald Trump, exulting that the biennial has â€œno critique, no discourse, no stakesâ€).  At the very least, no one seems to have read an art history textbook. There is a century of precedents for artistic intercessions into mass culture that undermine the fetishised â€œnewnessâ€ paraded here. The most obvious and important is dada: with his Monte Carlo Bond of 1924, Marcel Duchamp turned himself into not just a brand but a corporation. Think of the commercial mashups of modernist collage, or the deceptions of Parisâ€™s situationists in the 60s think of the redeployed images of 80s appropriation, or even Jeff Koonsâ€™s   sculpture. DISâ€™s     pose reboots 90s collective Art Club 2000, who staged mock fashion shoots with clothes from The Gap. Even the glib inclusion of an outdoor gym (yes, the biennial offers training sessions) rehashes the Documenta of 1992, which featured a boxing ring. Historical indifference is a venial sin. The mortal sin is DISâ€™s noxious metaphysics. For them, art is hopelessly tainted by commerce and the past is for suckers. Neoliberalism mechanically slays critical thinking, so insincerity is the only way out. (In fairness, DISâ€™s online magazine often publishes articles offering far more stimulation and seriousness). But why even make an exhibition, if you are this sneering about it? This show does not argue for a better art world it argues for giving up on art entirely. DIS are right about one thing: artists have to work inside the economic and   straitjackets of contemporary culture. Artists have to think hard about the changing nature of work, the dissolution of the private realm, the omnipresence of media, the psychological impact of data floods (and climatic ones). But to do so as flippantly as this biennial  â€”   to spit on the past and LOL at the present  â€”   is worse than arrogant it is a puerile misunderstanding of what art is and what it can do. In Berlin right now, a commanding show by the sculptor Rachel Harrison, on view at the gallery   Zeidler, exhibits deeper engagement with economics and identity than 50 biennial artists. Try being sincere try believing in something. Exhausted by the biennialâ€™s sarcasm, I took myself to the Deutsche Oper, which has erected a massive poster facing a major boulevard, one quite different from DISâ€™s    advert. The opera house faÃ§ade now features a panorama of the EUâ€™s border fence with Morocco  â€”   and, behind it, the gleaming Mediterranean in which more refugees will drown this week, the next week, and the week after that.  It may be idealistic, I know, to insist that arts institutions have a role to play in considering and changing that ghastly reality, and all the others of our damaged world. But better that than a digital nihilism so shameless it treats even the comeback of fascism as a joke. â€¢ The Berlin Biennale runs until 18 September at venues across the

It skirts the edge of absurdity, as anything like this must, but manages to keep clear, and it includes a big flourish in the manner of early films by M Night Shyamalan, which adroitly finesses the narrative issue of what exactly to do with a movie about aliens showing up on Earth. I have been agnostic about this kind of movie recently, after the overwrought disappointments of Christopher Nolanâ€™s Interstellar and Jeff Nicholsâ€™s Midnight Special. But Villeneuveâ€™s Arrival is both heartfelt and very entertaining. As is now expected with this kind of film, the protagonist is a flustered, bewildered civilian with special expertise, brusquely pressed into service by the military, which has got the spacecraft surrounded in the short term. Amy Adams is Dr Louise Banks, a professor of comparative linguistics with nothing and no one in her life but her work. But as it happens, Dr Banks was once seconded as a military adviser to translate a video of insurgents speaking Farsi. So when a dozen giant spaceships land in 12 different locations on Earth (including Devon  â€”   sadly there no scenes there) each looking like a bisected rugby ball standing on end, a bunch of army guys led by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) show up on Louiseâ€™s doorstep, demanding she come with them to help translate what the aliens are saying. Why, you ask, did they not approach Noam Chomsky, with his understanding of â€œdeep structureâ€ in language? Perhaps Prof Chomsky did not care to help Americaâ€™s   complex. At any rate, Louiseâ€™s liaison is the flirtatious Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) a military scientist who, in a stereotypical and fallacious way, equates his masculinity with science and affects to despise what he sees as the softer discipline of linguistics. Michael Stuhlbarg plays Halpern, the glowering CIA chief. But unbeknown to them, there is a secret tragedy in Louiseâ€™s life: a lost child, dead of cancer in her late teens. Her attempts to communicate with the aliens cause painful but illuminating echoes in her mind. If a lion could speak, said Wittgenstein, we would not understand him. Does the same go for aliens? Spielberg solved this issue elegantly in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by making the form of communication a   musical phrase, ending questioningly on the dominant. Villeneuveâ€™s solution is more literal. The aliens have a code which  â€”   a little preposterously  â€”   Louise finds herself more or less able to crack, with the crowdsourced expertise of the other 11   teams around the globe. But it is her human intuition, vulnerability and spontaneity that finally enable her to reach out to the visitors.  Inevitably, these â€œcontactâ€ moments are where the filmâ€™s real impact and atmosphere have to be. And Villeneuve doesnâ€™t disappoint in sequences of eerie and claustrophobic strangeness  â€”   though I concede the film is most effective before the physical form of the aliens is revealed. There are also touches of comedy: Ian and Louise decide, for convenienceâ€™s sake, to nickname two aliens Abbott and Costello  â€”   maybe in homage to the linguistic misunderstanding in the duoâ€™s famous routine about a baseball teamâ€™s positions. By coolly switching focus to political intrigue and betrayal within the human ranks, Villeneuve keeps a grip on his story and creates ballast for its departure into the realms of the visionary and supernatural. And he also prepares us for the filmâ€™s sense that language itself, freed of our usual sense of its linear form, might be more important than anyone thought. (I wonder if Villeneuve has seen the 2010 documentary Into Eternity, by Danish   Michael Madsen, about attempts to devise a new universal language to label underground repositories of nuclear waste  â€”   labels whose warnings have to be understood by future humans whose language has evolved away from what we know now.) Arrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its   highwire and disdains a net.

politifact14492,http://americannews.com/25127-2/,American News is under construction,"Itâ€™s â€œpitchforks and torches timeâ€ a prominent conservative sheriff tweeted on Saturday, with a condemnation of the government and media that echoes the increasingly heated rhetoric of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign. David A Clarke, the elected sheriff of Milwaukee County, is a leading Trump supporter who has previously called Black Lives Matter activists the â€œenemyâ€. Clarke paired what appeared to be an accusation of the corruption in most of the United States government with a photoshopped image of a crowd of people carrying burning sticks and pitchforks.  Clarkeâ€™s comments come at a time of growing anxiety over Trumpâ€™s repeated claims, without evidence, that the presidential election is rigged against him. At least one Trump supporter at a rally in Cincinnati on Friday was quoted by the Boston Globe as saying that if Clinton is elected, â€œI hope we can start a coup. â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to have a revolution and take them out of office, if thatâ€™s what it takes,â€ the supporter said. At a rally for Republican   candidate Mike Pence on Thursday, a woman from the audience told the candidate she, too, would rather take action than allow a Democrat to win. â€œI donâ€™t want this to happen  â€”   but I will tell you for me, personally, if Hillary Clinton gets in,â€ she warned, â€œIâ€™m ready for a revolution because we canâ€™t have her in. â€ â€œYou donâ€™t want  â€”   donâ€™t say that,â€ Pence replied.  Noting a history of violence at Trump rallies by his supporters, some online observers took Clarkeâ€™s call for â€œpitchforks and torchesâ€ seriously, asking whether he was inciting violence and whether his comments constituted sedition against the government. His remarks also raised concerns that it was inappropriate for a law enforcement official famous for his â€œlaw and orderâ€ political views to be calling for citizens to take to the streets. Robert Post, a first amendment expert and the dean of Yale Law School, said Clarkeâ€™s comments were â€œhorrible and despicableâ€ but that â€œan American court would view this as venting, basically. â€ In 1969, the supreme court overturned a Ku Klux Klan leaderâ€™s conviction for inciting violence. The Brandenburg case set a high bar: â€œIt says that you must intentionally be inciting imminent violence, and it has to be likely that thereâ€™s going to be violence. â€ Clarkeâ€™s tweet â€œwould fall far short of that testâ€ Post said.  Eugene Volokh, a Libertarian second amendment scholar at the University of California Los Angeles school of law, said Clarkeâ€™s remarks were clearly intended to be figurative.  â€œWhat do you think Sheriff Clarke is trying to get people to do? Is he trying to get them to spear someone with a pitchfork and burn down their house, or is he trying to motivate someone to vote for Trump or support conservative values? It seems to be quite clearly the latter,â€ he said.  When it came to hyperbolic rhetoric about violence, Volokh said, people were more likely to give people with   politics the benefit of the doubt, and to take their political opponents literally. Those who were taking Clarkeâ€™s pitchfork remarks seriously were â€œtaking it seriously because they donâ€™t like the guy whoâ€™s saying it,â€ Volokh said.  Incitement of violence is defined very narrowly under the law, leaving wide freedom of speech protections to talk about violence or revolution in hyperbolic or unspecific ways.  â€œIt has to be a situation where youâ€™re talking to a crowd and youâ€™re trying to get them to do something right now,â€ Volokh said.  â€œI donâ€™t think anyone looking at this would say, Wow, heâ€™s really asking me to show up with pitchfork and torches outside of the newspaper and burn it down. I donâ€™t think anyone would interpret it that way, especially in light of the photo. â€  Clarke has built a national platform for himself as a police official with extremely conservative,    views. He is a television commentator, has his own podcast, and is a prominent National Rifle Association speaker. In July, he compared the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street movements to the terror group Isis. â€œAmericans watching the news of the murders of police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, are observing a civil war unfold within our borders. A war between rule of law and   hate,â€ he wrote.  â€œThe murders in Baton Rouge, and before them Dallas, were not acts of domestic terrorism but guerrilla urban warfare against the police  â€”   who represent law and order  â€”   against the constitution, and against the American way. â€  In August, Clarke called for the National Guard to be sent to Milwaukee in response to unrest after police shot a    black man, even though the local police department and mayor said this was unnecessary.  â€œPeople have to find a more socially acceptable way to deal with their frustration, their anger and resentment. We cannot have the social upheaval,â€ Clarke told a local Fox news station.  A man who answered the phone at a number listed under Clarkeâ€™s name declined to identify himself, and hung up without answering any questions. Clarke later tweeted: â€œBig Media @abcdigital, @GuardianUS and @CNN called,â€ Clarke tweeted later on Saturday. â€œShould be as interested in reporting on WikiLeaks and Clinton corruption than my tweets. â€  Fran McLaughlin, a spokeswoman at the Milwaukee County sheriffâ€™s office, did not respond to a request for comment on the sheriffâ€™s tweet.  A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the organization approved of Clarkeâ€™s â€œpitchforks and torchesâ€ rhetoric.  After his pitchforks tweet, Clarke tweeted again directly to Trump supporters, citing the New Testament and sharing a photograph of himself with the Republican nominee.  â€œTo all @realDonaldTrump supporters, Let Not Your Hearts Be Troubled (John:14  ) Big media knows that our day is coming. Stay strong,â€ he wrote.",796,408,9.03E+17,fake

The   council met to pay tribute to Ban, who will step down later this month. Being gay is a crime in at least 73 countries, the UN has said, and the issue of gay rights consistently sparks heated debate at the United Nations.  The United States and other members had wanted a council statement to read: â€œIt is thanks to you, Mr   that women, young people, and the LGBT community have been heard and assisted, and today their voices sound louder and stronger in this headquarters and around the world. â€ However, Russia objected, diplomats said. The   council instead agreed to a statement that said because of Banâ€™s human rights promotion â€œthe most vulnerable or marginalised have been increasingly heard and assisted by the United Nationsâ€.  Ban has long advocated for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality but faced opposition from African, Arab and Muslim states as well as Russia and China.  In 2014, Ban said the UN would recognize all   marriages of its staff, allowing them to receive its benefits. Russia, with the support of 43 states including Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, India, Egypt, Pakistan, and Syria, unsuccessfully tried to overturn the move last year.  In February, the   African Group, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the   Group of Friends of the Family led by Belarus, Egypt and Qatar protested six new UN stamps promoting LGBT equality.",845,473,9.69E+17,fake
politifact13484,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/,Thinking about writing in a candidate on Election Day? Read this before you do.,"American artist Jeff Koons is giving Paris a monumental sculpture of a bunch of flowers in commemoration of the lives lost in the 2015 terrorist attacks in the French city. The work, called Bouquet of Tulips, is a â€œsymbol of remembrance, optimism and healing in moving forward from the horrific events that occurred in Paris one year ago,â€ Koons said. The fistful of colourful flowers is also meant to resemble the hand of the Statue of Liberty. â€œOne hundred and thirty years after France gave the Statue of Liberty to the United States, Jeff Koons wanted to celebrate the remarkable   alliance that has endured and flourished for over 200 years,â€ said a statement. At 10. 4 metres (34ft) high, 8. 4 metres wide and 10. 2 metres deep, the work, currently being built in Germany, and made of bronze, stainless steel and aluminium, is to be installed on the plaza outside the Museum of Modern Art and the Palais de Tokyo next year. â€œI hope the work is   to people,â€ Koons said on Monday. â€œI hope that the Bouquet of Tulips can communicate a sense of future, of optimism, the joy of offering to find something greater outside the self. â€ Koons said he hoped the flowers would give the victimsâ€™ families the strength to continue. â€œThey are a symbol that life goes forward,â€ he said, adding that the sculpture had been inspired by the floral paintings of Monet, Picasso and Fragonard, among others. A wave of terrorist shootings and bombings across Paris last November killed 130 people and injured hundreds more, including at the Bataclan music venue. Jane Hartley, the US ambassador to France, said: â€œMy hope is this amazing sculpture will bring visitors to Paris. â€ She added: â€œOur two countries share so much politically, economically and culturally  â€”   but most importantly, France and the United States share a deeply held belief in the universal principles of freedom and liberty. â€ The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the sculptureâ€™s optimistic message was welcome. â€œThat such an immense artist should have the original idea to offer Paris a monumental work, symbolising generosity and sharing, demonstrates the unbreakable links between our capita and the US,â€ she said. The â‚¬3m (Â£2. 6m) statue is being financed by private donations from America and France. Koons has not always been appreciated in France. In 2008, when 16 of his works was displayed at Versailles, critics questioned whether the historic site was an appropriate place for sculptures by â€œan artist considered a paragon of kitschâ€.

Launched in New York last week, itâ€™s designed to alert nearby users whenever a crime is reported to 911. Users can use that information to avoid the danger area  â€”   or go and film it with their smartphone to broadcast the unfolding crime. â€œWhat if everyone within a quarter mile of every reported crime were immediately made aware of it. What if there were a camera on every crime. What if transparency existed  â€”   if we all knew where crime was occurring and how it was being resolved. Would crime as we know it still exist?â€ asks the company in a Medium post announcing the appâ€™s launch. The app, created by a company called Sp0n (its sparse website says it makes â€œdisruptive consumer mobile appsâ€) was swiftly kicked off the App Store by Apple, which had â€œconcernsâ€ about its content, according to a note on Vigilante. Live. The developers believe that opening up crime reporting in this way empowers people. â€œThe closed system excludes the community while the open system informs and empowers citizens,â€ it says. At the heart of Vigilante is the belief that mass surveillance makes the world a better, fairer place through the rhetorical question: can injustice survive transparency? â€œThe lens of the camera is incapable of lying. When we are able to look at a situation from multiple angles, the truth emerges. Transparency is the single most powerful tool against crime and injustice, and we believe it will rebuild cooperation towards a shared vision. Cooperation, in turn, will lead to safer communities, better cities, and a stronger nation. â€ Itâ€™s a utopian vision, but one thatâ€™s a little confused. On one hand Vigilante talks about restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, which suggests that video streaming could help document and prevent police brutality. Yet on the other hand, itâ€™s precisely the kind of tool that could be abused to intimidate and harass innocent minorities with the kind of racial profiling that became rampant on the Nextdoor app. â€œIt raises all these questions around consent and sharing,â€ said Sam Gregory, programme director of Witness, which trains and supports activists to document human rights violations. He is concerned about the framing of the app, down to the name and promotional materials. â€œVigilantism is a very different idea to being an ethical witness to whatâ€™s happening,â€ he said. â€œThese types of tools tend to have racial bias and only focus on very visible incidents. Things you can see in the street, as we saw with Nextdoor and Sketchfactor,â€ he said. In this way, the app encourages the public incrimination of     people at the scene. The lens of the camera may be incapable of lying, but thereâ€™s always bias in the selection of subject matter. When untrained bystanders start to make judgment calls over who is at fault, thereâ€™s broad scope for miscarriage of justice. He cites research into the filming of violence against transgender people and how it is shared and engaged with online as entertainment.  â€œThereâ€™s a tradeoff between visibility of a crime and making people who didnâ€™t want to be on camera into a public spectacle,â€ he said. At the same time,   vigilantes could find themselves escalating a situation the police could have dealt with easily or putting themselves in danger. As the New York police department told the Verge, â€œCrimes in progress should be handled by the NYPD and not a vigilante with a cellphone. â€ Apple doesnâ€™t comment on individual decisions, but the App Store has strict rules about   content apps to prevent abuse or bullying. The company also rejects apps if they risk physical harm, which could be possible if a load of vigilantes took their pitchforks to a crime scene. â€œOur core mission is empowering communities with technology to create safer neighborhoods,â€ a Sp0n spokeswoman said in a statement. â€œThe team is working with Apple to resolve the issue and they are confident the app will be made available in the near future. Vigilante will introduce an Android version of the app in the upcoming weeks with plans to expand in additional cities later this year. â€",350,775,"862477831900680193	862489243951575040	862516347229556737	862519451358572544	862704280255553536	862725049412878336	862773696078938112	862775579560603648	862786724556099584	862815824314327042	862879425741832192	862899227034177537	862904685992259584	863455447562559489	863530322062921728	863621946268844037	863882992703475712	867456881647865856	867468324162211840	867598433808527360",fake

Humans love a   itâ€™s almost compulsive. We do it even when itâ€™s not our job  â€”   we zoom out, zoom in, sum up, assess, recontextualise our experiences as theyâ€™re happening, hold this arbitrary chunk of time up against romanticised memories of arbitrary time chunks past. And every year we declare the outgoing year to have been the worst year ever. This time, though, we may finally be right. I remember writing, â€œGo fuck yourself, 2011. â€ I called 2014 a â€œgarbage yearâ€ and â€œthe most dismal misery parade on recordâ€. A year ago this week I wrote, â€œPerhaps the close of every year feels this borderline apocalyptic, and we simply lose perspective each time, but 2015 seems like it has to be the darkest year in my living memory. â€ Those sentiments felt a tad melodramatic back when I wrote them, but they donâ€™t read as histrionics to me now. Thatâ€™s exactly what it feels like to be hurtling toward a catastrophe whose shape you canâ€™t quite make out. (Well, mystery solved.) The problem with electing a petty, impulsive, opportunistic pinball to be your president is   â€¦     I have no idea. He could do anything. There is no precedent. Thereâ€™s no way to plan. Looking ahead to 2017 doesnâ€™t invite New Year resolutions so much as what one friend of mine called â€œemotional doomsday preppingâ€. So here are the things Iâ€™m currently clinging to  â€”   the things I know I can do. A lot of seemingly reasonable people are talking in silky tones about the importance of â€œunityâ€ and â€œcompromiseâ€ and â€œempathyâ€ right now. But you donâ€™t pull yourself out of quicksand by agreeing to leave one foot in the muck. There is no middle ground between equality and racism, or womenâ€™s humanity and womenâ€™s subjugation. Donâ€™t let the rightwing erosion of language shake your instincts. Reject false equivalencies.  The New York Times reported this week that, in a letter to   activists, Donald Trump vowed to prioritise â€œputting   justices on the supreme court passing a national   ban like Ohioâ€™s eliminating federal money for Planned Parenthood as long as its clinics perform abortions and making permanent the Hyde amendment, passed annually by Congress to ban   abortions. â€ If you are a person capable of getting pregnant, get a period tracker so you can catch pregnancies as early as possible. Get an IUD. Stockpile Plan B, for yourself and others. Get a pap smear while you still have healthcare. The person who answers the phone in your congresspersonâ€™s office has no interest in yelling at you or arguing with you or even remembering you. They just want to write down your information so they can go and get a lunch. Experienced, paid investigative journalists may just save us all. Pay for your news so the news can stay in business. But also, read critically. Hold editorial boards accountable. Demand diverse newsrooms. Participate in what you consume. Trump is our first   president, and TV personalities want good ratings. Trump hates protests. He hates Alec Baldwin making fun of him. He caves in to public opinion. Go out and march and meet people and feel something, and donâ€™t let anyone tell you it doesnâ€™t matter. A few days   a smart friend wrote me a smart email. â€œI feel the bottom line for America is that everyone will have to be more political,â€ he wrote, â€œand this will last for the rest of our lives   â€¦     Not only should you donate to every Democratic senator, congressperson, state legislator, and governor in your state or districts, you should donate to organisations that preserve civil liberties, education, LGBT rights, medical care, reproductive   and the environment. â€ Here is the most important part: â€œFor most   and   people, your taxes are about to be lower. Tax yourself if you want the country and the government to look how you wish it could look. â€ Tax yourself. So many people are in danger under this incoming administration. Donâ€™t forget anyone. I wrote this on December 31, 2012 and found it weirdly comforting. â€œLife is really, really hard and surprising. Hereâ€™s what has happened to me over (approximately) the past year: I moved to a different state, then back again I quit a beloved longterm job and started a bigger, scarier job I went through a     and a complicated   I got   for $800, 000 (lol  â€”   flattering!) I turned 30 I acquired children my dad died my aunt died my dog died my tooth died and every day, during all of that, a bunch of anonymous dickheads told me I was a fat bitch on the internet. So, sure, maybe in January 2012 I promised myself I was going to run a 10k this year or whatever, but at this point, WHOOOOO CAAAAARES. Sometimes life gets in the way of our life goals. Sometimes the worst year is also the best year. And thatâ€™s hard enough to process without beating ourselves up over some artificial standards we imposed when we had no clue what was about to happen. â€ Forgive yourself for not running a 10k.

The Groundhog Day actor doesnâ€™t have an agent and instead uses a   number for pitches and offers. On his 20th birthday he was arrested trying to smuggle around 10lb of marijuana through Chicagoâ€™s Oâ€™Hare airport. He has jammed with Eric Clapton, lived and breathed Hunter S Thompson to play him in Where the Buffalo Roam, sung a duet with Clint Eastwood and tended an Austin bar for the night with members of the   Clan, giving everyone tequila shots no matter what they ordered.  There is already   folklore around the living legend that is Bill Murray, and now we have another one: when Bill Murray does an impression of a crying baby, he looks exactly like Tom Hanks.  In the biggest optical illusion the internet has encountered since The Dress, a photo posted to the Facebook group Reasons My Son Is Crying has triggered a debate just as furious, with many people convinced itâ€™s the Forrest Gump actor, despite the original post stating it was Bill Murray. The picture was posted to the Facebook group in 2013 by Laura   but was taken in October 2012 at St Andrews golf course in Scotland by her husband, Adam Ross. The photo features Laura holding her crying    son, Alexander, in front of Murray, who is mimicking the childâ€™s expression. According to   who lives in Perthshire, the photo â€œpops up on Facebook every few monthsâ€. This week, the photo was widely shared online again and became a trending item across social media and websites including Reddit.  â€œWe are finding this very funny. I personally donâ€™t see the resemblance to Tom Hanks but weâ€™ve noticed that people have been mentioning it for years,â€ she told the Guardian. She said that Murray was friendly and chatted to everyone at the golf course but that their encounter was brief. â€œWe are big Ghostbusters fans and have grown up with his movies. Although Iâ€™m also a huge fan of Tom Hanks, so that would have been awesome as well. â€ Two years later,   met Murray again when he was golfing with Huey Lewis, and she got him to sign the photo. â€œHe got a laugh from it,â€ she said.  Does Alexander, who is now four, know that his photo is causing such a stir? â€œNope. No clue. He barely knows that itâ€™s him in the photo and doesnâ€™t know who Bill is. â€",637,367,"871031716277882880	871032109422567425	871051917392269315	871058403560476672	871078323274821632	871087727432921088	871101005601005568	871111025097150464	871111100875460608	871114541551276032	871162046888509442	871170014082211841	871183938638798848	871190391734796288	871194364084711424	871237631492980736	871338752161046528	871349411988688896	871369676282114048	871379722932023297	871384123658653697	871395480177184768	871396780348502016	871408235017904130	871414701028134916	871439627890171904	871450303626956800	871485477609762819	871506474471743488	871506664175923200	871550227194490880	871569096961400833	871631190150840320	871653169247510528	871725374161420288	871905371484499968	878198697355497472	880152148356481024	888300506765967360	914785330825482240",fake

(DETAILS),"The Mona Lisa has a note reading â€œthis way upâ€ Rembrandtâ€™s Lucretia is screwed together with car parts, and Matisseâ€™s The Red Studio is covered with chicken wire. These are the revelations of an exhibition at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, which displays a new side to some of the worldâ€™s most famous paintings, thanks to an intriguing series of artworks by Brazilian artist Vik Muniz. The clue is in the name, Verso, meaning â€œthe backâ€ in Portuguese. In a special exhibition space in this museum of Dutch Golden Age art,   frames lean casually against the walls, as though waiting to be hung. They include Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s La Gioconda (the Mona Lisa) Pablo Picassoâ€™s Les Demoiselles dâ€™Avignon, and Vincent Van Goghâ€™s Starry Night. These are not the originals but minutely recreated replicas of their  . There are also five new facsimiles on show based on works in the Mauritshuis collection, including Johannes Vermeerâ€™s Girl with a Pearl Earring and View of Delft, as well as Rembrandtâ€™s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp  â€”   which, it turns out, has a warning on the back about a rather nasty splinter. Muniz first saw what lies behind art as an    on a school trip to an installation by the Italian architect Lina Bo Bardi, which was hung on glass easels in the Museu de Arte de SÃ£o Paulo. â€œI wasnâ€™t very interested by the paintings,â€ he recalls, â€œbut looking at the backs of them, they looked like medieval machines. â€ He started his Verso series 40 years later, after walking around the Guggenheim New York with   Lisa Dennison, and being fascinated by the   back of Pablo Picassoâ€™s Woman Ironing, which was leaning face down against a wall. â€œI felt I shouldnâ€™t be there,â€ he says, â€œAs though I was in the presence of somebody I knew very well, and saw that person naked. It was very intimate. â€ Muniz was allowed to take   photos of the Picasso (and the backs of other masterpieces) and began working with a team, including his own   Barry Frier and art expert Tony Pinotti, to make them into exquisite   models. â€œYou have this sense you are dealing with paintings as objects, not images,â€ he explains. â€œImages transcend physical space  â€”   they can be electronic  â€”   but an object has a physical presence. The back reflects the artistâ€™s studio, it has nails, hardware and is always changing. It shows the museumâ€™s role as conservator, too. â€ â€œHe has collected a group of paintings that are iconic works, things you should know in your mindâ€™s eye,â€ says Emilie Gordenker, Mauritshuis director and curator of the Verso show. â€œYou realise these things are actual physical objects. They are things: they get hung up, they get written on and pasted on. â€ The first room of the show is deliberately presented without signage, with paintings sitting on blocks against the walls. â€œThereâ€™s this shock,â€ she says, walking around. â€œYou come in and feel you shouldnâ€™t be here, that itâ€™s not done yet. â€ Muniz was adamant, says Gordenker. â€œHe wanted it very plain, no signs, nothing. The idea is that you should start poking around and discover for yourself what it is. â€ This being a museum show, however, there is of course a digital   with an image of each of the 15 original paintings and commentary from Muniz. Of the Mona Lisa, for instance, he says: â€œIt has handwriting saying â€˜this way upâ€™  â€”   as if somebody would make that mistake!â€ Some paintings are covered with labels charting previous owners or places to which the painting has toured others reveal signs of damage,   on material that in the case of Rembrandtâ€™s Anatomy Lesson is no longer manufactured, and curious gallery techniques. The back of the da Vinci is monitored with an electronic system that alerts curators if it expands or contracts, risking irreparable damage. The Vermeer replica also reveals complex framing techniques employed on the works of the Dutch painter so they would endure, while mysterious springs used by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in framing Rembrandtâ€™s Lucretia, are more commonly found in the US car industry. A second room shows how the team aged and recreated woods, materials and stickers for the replicas, from buying a whole tree to get the wood for the Mona Lisa to getting a woman with a collection of old looms in upstate New York to   the herringbone fabric for the Rembrandt. They created   to mimic degraded stamps, carefully painted in old marks and tracings, and even persuaded some museums to give them their own stickers. â€œThe reaction has been really positive so far,â€ says Gordenker. â€œIâ€™m looking for new ways to reconsider our old collection and this is a very good way to do it. â€ Meanwhile, Muniz, who divides his time between Rio de Janerio and New York, is planning the next works, which may prove â€œforbiddinglyâ€ costly to make: Gustav Klimtâ€™s Kiss and Edvard Munchâ€™s The Scream. He would love an invitation to the Courtauld or National Gallery in London, and hopes his exhibition will tour other museums, adding works to the series based on their collections. As a viewer, itâ€™s incredibly tempting to take a peek behind his frames. â€œThe artist would, I think, quite like it,â€ admits Gordenker, â€œbut we prefer not. We put little alarms on the back, so we know if it happens. He wants you to have a look  â€”   in fact thereâ€™s nothing there. â€ â€¢ Vik Muniz: Verso is at the Mauritshuis, The Hague, until 4 September.",237,637,"877693335317520384	877698052802224129	877705360483655680	877722042921082882	877726472089227264	877728078692102145	877760522975723520	877885371039731712	877898642161520640	877898655977529344	877900267899019268	877914933924696065	877921232095596545	877928728969355264	877928766235746305	877930864335765504	877956542783299585	877970618410520576	877970833725108225	877985719657971712	877988066052509696	877993344688836608	878029735317524480	878037820274692096	878055473781514241	878058340798091265	878085574015557632	878106638602850304	878214547449892866	878277005040427009	878329489888993280	878335617733541888	878389484852609024	878430935745744896	878456330360672256	878467772099031040	878765420085465088	878769701026881538	878815067524825088	878819121344860161	878897408062746624	879035118081519616	879140608086093824	879189890876964865	879307280264687618	879361187154202626	880113834610106371	880138471888875525	882810254018215936	882849663870672897	883392925807165441	886193559996682240	904757385842933760",fake
politifact15655,http://politifeed.net/news/abc-news-joins-obama-to-ban-american-flag-lapel-pins-heres-what-you-need-to-know,"ABC News Joins Obama In Ban Of American Flag Lapel Pins, Here’s What You Need To Know","While prime minister Justin Trudeau flogged our public assets last week, he had a soothing message: rest assured, weâ€™ll be   by the private sector. Bankers and billionaires lined up to sound a note of confidence. â€œI think itâ€™s unprecedented,â€ exclaimed Canadaâ€™s top business lobbyist John Manley. â€œA     opportunity,â€ enthused Trudeauâ€™s economic advisory council. These corporate figures are rubbing their hands because Trudeau is about to put one of our great crises in their hands: the need for historic investment in the countryâ€™s infrastructure, for so long the domain of the state. No one will deny the urgency. Roads and bridges are crumbling and congested with traffic. Subways and buses overcrowded and underfunded. We need a   of   initiatives to avert catastrophic climate change, and a   of defences to protect ourselves from floods and fires already locked in.  But many will question the Liberals plan to deal with it: selling off existing public assets to raise money, and having private investors fund, build and operate new infrastructure. If they get their way, expect a wave of privatizations â€”  targeting public services and goods like roads, ports, airports, utilities, the post office, and more. According to Adam Vaughan, one of its Liberal architects, there simply isnâ€™t an alternative: â€œto be afraid of the private sector when youâ€™re trying to fix this countryâ€™s infrastructure is shortsighted  â€¦    stupid, irresponsible. â€ By responsible and   does Vaughan mean the result of past Canadian experiments in privatization? Unsafely constructed schools. Packed, dangerous prisons. Water treatment systems flooded with sewage. Super hospitals built with faulty wiring in emergency rooms. Senior care homes   with inedible food and filth. The politicians prattle about the private sector covering the risk of projects: the enabling lie that cannot for its life find evidence. Time and again, the costs of these   partnerships have instead been borne by the public. In Ontario over the last decade alone, their   burdened citizens with an extra $8bn and racked up $30bn in public liabilities â€”  the equivalent of $6000 per household. But perhaps Canadians are just too stupid to understand their merits. Stupid enough that 75 percent of them surveyed now oppose such privatization schemes. So stupid, indeed, that in many cases they have clamoured successfully for these services to be returned to public control. Trudeauâ€™s plan for a privatization bank would expand these local disasters to a national scale. Corporate and   backers have already announced they expect returns of 7 to 9 percent on their investments. How do you think that will happen? The only way that skimping ever does: higher bills, user fees, and hidden government subsidies. Diminishment in quality of service. Cuts in jobs and pay. No wonder some of Trudeauâ€™s corporate advisors are offering their helpful advice free of charge: itâ€™s regular people who will end up carrying the cost. These costs are not an oversight of privatization but their objective: the inevitable result of opening up the public sphere to private  . For more than thirty years in Canada, such measures have been a tool of an elite agenda promoted by successive Liberal and Tory governments: the transfer of wealth from the poorer to the wealthy, from the public trust to the private clutch. Is it any wonder why most peopleâ€™s incomes and standard of living have stagnated, while those of millionaires has skyrocketed? So itâ€™s not surprise that Trudeau doesnâ€™t dare call privatization by its name. Instead his Ministers have invented hip, ambiguous names like â€œasset recyclingâ€ and the â€œflywheel of reinvestmentâ€ to describe their proposed schemes. And the public opposition might explain how the Liberalsâ€™ proclivity for consultations hasnâ€™t extended to this matter.  Because privatization serves the elite, it always spawns contempt for democracy. Take this revelatory example from a decade ago: a   used by a Canadian legal firm as they promoted privatization projects in British Columbia. One slide describing the obstacles to privatization is entitled â€œInherent diseases. â€ The obstacles? â€œStakeholders,â€ â€œtransparency,â€ and â€œpublic justification. â€ For corporations chasing endless profits, the basic value of democracy are not essential to a healthy, thriving society. They are a scourge to be avoided. All this secrecy, euphemism and dismissive rhetoric is meant to obscure a single, glaring fact: the arguments in favour of privatization are rubbish. There is no need to privatize public assets: with government borrowing rates at historic lows, the Liberals could simply take out loans and build infrastructure at a fraction of the cost. And forget the notion that weâ€™re broke. This line is regularly peddled by the political and corporate class to distract from the cash, much of it accumulated through tax cuts, hoarded by Canadian corporations: at the end of 2015, a stunning $600bn.  Youâ€™d think that Trudeauâ€™s   pledge, so crucial to his election, would have meant putting our hands on some of these obscene corporate profits. It has taken scarcely a year for the facade to fall away. He has barely shifted Canadaâ€™s taxation structure â€”  meaning government revenue, which could be the engine of a bold economic transformation, remains at the lowest since the   period. And now, none other than Donald Trump has introduced a privatization infrastructure bank proposal strikingly similar to Trudeauâ€™s. Will even that not make the Liberals blush? Those of us who anticipated and warned that Justin Trudeau would continue such policies were shouted down. But privatization, deregulation and downsizing in the scope and spending of the state: this is the neoliberal consensus that continues to grip politics across the continent. Donald Trump has become only its most racist and authoritarian expression Trudeau its most glossy and beguiling. The transition that Canadians want will require enormous levels of spending â€”  and need to be public and paid for. By strengthening and reinventing the public sphere, the government could unleash a program of mass transit, building renovations, storm barriers, urban redesign and green jobs that reduces emissions, racism and inequality all at once. But pretending the private sector can lead this is a recipe for disaster: their hunger for profits will prevent this transformation from being either ambitious, accessible or fair.   economists call it privatization. Liberal   will call it by some fanciful name. I call it the legalized fleecing of Canadians, a giant corporate giveaway. Twitter: @Martin_Lukacs",332,274,,fake

A massive response is required. UN teams are working with local officials to assess needs. â€  Power was still out, water and food were scarce on Monday, and officials said young men in villages along the road between the   cities of Les Cayes and Jeremie were putting up blockades of rocks and broken branches to halt convoys of vehicles bringing relief supplies. One convoy carrying food, water and medications was attacked by gunmen in a remote valley where there had been a mudslide, said Frednel Kedler, coordinator for the civil protection agency in the   department, which includes Jeremie. He said authorities would try to reach marooned and desperate communities west of Jeremie on Monday. The national civil protection headquarters in    on Monday raised its official nationwide death toll to 372, which included 198 deaths in  . Local officials have said the toll tops 500 in   alone. The UN humanitarian agency in Geneva, meanwhile, made an emergency appeal for nearly $120m in aid to help provide â€œ  assistance and protectionâ€ for 750, 000 people in   Haiti over the next three months.  UN officials said earlier that at least 1. 4 million people across the region needed assistance and that 2. 1 million overall had been affected by the hurricane. Some 175, 000 people remained in shelters Monday. The agency said flooding had hampered efforts to reach the most affected areas, and that the hurricane had increased the risk of a â€œrenewed spikeâ€ in the number of cholera cases. A continuing cholera outbreak has already killed roughly 10, 000 people and sickened more than 800, 000 since 2010. Roosevelt Zamos, an official with the civil protection agency, told the Associated Press that there were 40 cases of cholera in Jeremie alone. He said eight people had died of cholera in the   department since the storm. It can take 12 hours to five days for cholera symptoms to appear after a person ingests contaminated food or water, according to the World Health Organization. The   cholera treatment center at Jeremieâ€™s main hospital had no running water on Monday and at least a dozen of the new patients were under age 10. Etienne Chimene tried her best to soothe her    boy, Cenelson, who was lying in a wooden bed with a hole cut in it and a bucket underneath. â€œI feel like my baby is getting worse,â€ she said as she stroked his head and he whimpered. The center was overcrowded, and patients who were improving were forced outside. Among them was    Nedrine Cabane, who sat on the ground with her father, who had brought her a pot of plantain soup that she ate gratefully. It was her first meal in three days. â€œThe fact that there is so much dirty water around makes me think that more people are going to get sick,â€ she said. Dr Thiery Francois, lead doctor for the ministry of health at the cholera center, said he didnâ€™t know how new cholera cases had been caused by the storm nationwide. â€œCertainly there are cases we donâ€™t know anything about,â€ he said, referring to   areas. People in the seaside communities of Port Salut and Les Cayes said little to no aid had reached them by Sunday. Besides food and water, they needed clothing and especially shoes because many had cut their feet or stepped on old nails in the scattered debris. â€œI lost everything. See what I have on? Somebody gave it to me,â€ said Merlaine Chere in Port Salut. She showed off a wound from stepping on a nail and said she had been denied treatment at a local hospital because it demanded a $150 payment she didnâ€™t have. Dominique Pomper, a fisherman, said the mayor had come to distribute some rice but that was it. Among other things, he said, people here needed water. The surging ocean contaminated their wells, making water undrinkable. Pomper said he had tried to stay at home with his family during the storm but they eventually fled as the water rushed into their house. The    said it was the worst night of his life, but that he would never leave his seaside village. â€œWe are fishermen here our job is the water. We canâ€™t run away from the water,â€ he said. The airstrip in Jeremie is unable to accommodate large cargo planes, so relief was being ferried to the devastated city by helicopter. Three of nine US helicopters had arrived in Jeremie by Sunday, bringing rice and cooking oil, among other things. â€œI lost everything I own in this hurricane.

politifact13591,http://smag31.com/mom-applies-remedy-baby-moments-later-dies-careful-moms/,"Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies. Be careful with this, moms!","My father is trying to â€œeducateâ€ me about â€œthe real Hillary Clintonâ€ so he starts telling me about Vince Foster  â€”   and then itâ€™s Benghazi, again. Normally, Iâ€™d deflect with a shrug and a sigh. But now, as he follows me into the family room, still ranting, I snap. â€œSure, Dad, Hillary got to all of those people all over the world  â€”   with her laser eyes. â€ Like many millennial women who are excited about the prospect of electing the first female president in history, Iâ€™ve tiptoed on the faultline between my political passions and my desire for a   Thanksgiving. My father is decidedly less enthused about the prospect of her presidency  â€”   and he lets me know it every time I go to my parentsâ€™ house. As a baby boomer who came of age when Don Drapers inherited the earth, he still canâ€™t grasp that our next    may wear a pantsuit. My father raises the specter of â€œBillaryâ€ says that Clinton â€œalready had her turn at running the countryâ€. He rants that she wonâ€™t be â€œtough enough on the terroristsâ€. And he calls Trey Gowdy, the congressman who spearheaded the Benghazi hearings, â€œmy buddyâ€ who must, at all costs, â€œreally stick it to Hillaryâ€. Heâ€™s hardly alone in rejecting the first woman with a serious shot at the White House, just as I wasnâ€™t the only young woman tearing up the night Clinton accepted the nomination. Our dynamic plays out between fathers and daughters  â€”   around dinner tables, over phone lines and in inboxes  â€”   all over the country.  One woman from a   Facebook group says her father   asked her if the country is really ready for a woman president. Other womenâ€™s dads equate Bill Clintonâ€™s wandering eye with Hillaryâ€™s supposed failure as a human being  â€”   if she canâ€™t even hold her own husbandâ€™s interest, how can she captivate a country? Or sometimes, the   â€™ Facebook feeds are minefields of more coded sexism, old chestnuts about Clinton being too   and cold too dim to manage her personal email account too mannish in her pantsuits and, above all else, â€œtoo shrillâ€. Some of these   fathers have always leaned rightwing, and are robustly (or reluctantly) backing Donald Trump others tilt toward Gary Johnson, or are     â€”   but no matter whom these dads vote for, when they indulge in ugly   smears, they sound like Rush Limbaughâ€™s cronies to their disappointed daughters.  Several women I spoke to are taking a â€œdonâ€™t tell Dadâ€ approach to this election, citing a simple desire to come back home in peace (which is why some asked to remain anonymous) or belief that they wonâ€™t change their fathersâ€™ minds: â€œItâ€™s possible to have more productive conversations with a dishwasher than with him,â€ one woman said. Others, like Irina Gonzalez, fight back. â€œI defend HRC and emphasize how much I canâ€™t wait to vote for her. â€ Another lamented her dadâ€™s paradoxical belief that â€œcheating, â€˜Lying Hillaryâ€™â€ should â€œshow more heartâ€. One could argue that these Archie   curmudgeons canâ€™t imagine their baby girls ever dealing with catcalls or (God forbid) having a period  â€”   so how could they understand that their Breitbart bon mots reflect the real biases their daughters confront every day? For Farrah Parker, former executive director for the City of Los Angeles commission on women, these tensions are generational growing pains: â€œYoung people will always carry the burden of enlightening their families, especially if they have had diverse educational or professional experiences   â€¦     A young woman who supports Hillary can be unfairly portrayed as [questioning] her own family structure   â€¦     This can make for one long family dinner. â€ Even the women who keep mum at the kitchen table insist that their fathersâ€™ disdain doesnâ€™t sway their support for Clinton. â€œIâ€™m not ashamed of what I believe. Iâ€™m on the right side of history,â€ one woman told me. â€œBut   â€¦     Iâ€™d rather skirt the truth every four years than not go home again. â€ Cindy Butor, 29, has caucused and canvassed for Clinton because she deeply believes in her, â€œbut it amuses me how irritated my dad would be if he knewâ€. As a librarian, Butor is especially vexed by her father parroting misinformation about Clintonâ€™s tenure as secretary of state and stance on gun control sheâ€™s doubled down on debating him, but sometimes, she resigns herself to live and let live: â€œHe is   â€¦     my dad, so I want to have a relationship with him. â€  Clintonâ€™s famous pantsuits have been a source of consternation between Tabitha Clark, 31, and her uncle, the man who will walk her down the aisle at her wedding. Clarkâ€™s uncle equates Bill Clintonâ€™s roaming eye with Hillaryâ€™s supposed failures as a human being his takeaway is not to trust any woman who wears a pantsuit  â€”   never mind that Clark wears pantsuits to her job. When she reminds him of this, he says that sheâ€™s different, since sheâ€™s not in politics. â€œHeâ€™s actually very supportive of my life, except that Iâ€™m a liberal,â€ Clark jokes. Another friend explains that her   father bought her tool sets as well as Barbies: â€œMy dad is a smart guy. When the subject doesnâ€™t involve politics, we can usually have a very civil and productive discussion. â€  Though itâ€™s tempting to characterize the men of a certain age who mock Clinton as unilateral   many of them champion their own daughtersâ€™ ambitions.

The cut, which started at 5. 16pm, hit Soho, which was packed with tourists, shoppers and people enjoying the areaâ€™s bars and restaurants. Some West End plays, including Aladdin, Jersey Boys, Thriller Live, the Curious Incident of the Dog in the   and Les MisÃ©rables were cancelled, with theatres offering refunds. Lauren Tucker, whose sister and mother were planning on seeing Les Mis this evening after travelling into London from Bath and Bristol, said: â€œThe tickets, which cost Â£318 for six tickets, so Â£52 each, were birthday presents and they are unsure whether they can travel back up to watch the show. They were purchased direct with the venue who will refund the tickets, but we assume no compensation is going to be provided in terms of hotel and travel,â€ she said. The lights were back on at 9pm and other shows including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were able to go ahead with a delayed start.  UK Power Network have revealed that the disruption was due to a faulty piece of equipment on their underground electricity network. A spokesperson said: â€œAll power supplies were restored by 9pm. We apologise for the impact this incident caused and for the inconvenience. â€ The company had earlier said that 2, 300 properties were affected.

It was announced on Wednesday that theyâ€™ll be joined by James Belushi and Juno Temple. As with all of Allenâ€™s recent films, plot details on his 48th feature are being kept largely under wraps. All thatâ€™s known is that takes place in 1950s New York and that shooting is due to begin this fall. Allenâ€™s last film, Cafe Society, premiered to mostly favorable reviews on the opening night of Cannes. The Guardianâ€™s Peter Bradshaw called Allenâ€™s tribute to   Hollywood â€œamiable, if insubstantialâ€. Itâ€™s set for release on 15 July in the US. Additionally, Allen is almost near completing his   television show: an untitled   series he wrote and directed for Amazon starring himself, Miley Cyrus and Elaine May. It will premiere exclusively on Amazon Prime Video later this year. The      found himself once again at the center of controversy at the Cannes film festival in May, following repeated allegations from his son (Ronan Farrow)  â€”   which were firmly denied by the    â€”   that he abused his daughter Dylan Farrow.

Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign, which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump. But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome, a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow. He must be confirmed by the Senate. While the other leading candidates for the job held largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia, the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013. The Wall Street Journal reported: â€œFriends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson. â€ The    Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals, including a 2011 agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant   Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobilâ€™s operations overseas. Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the  . Sechin, sometimes described as the    man in Russia, is now under US sanctions. He has said that one of his ambitions is to â€œride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillersonâ€. The 2011   agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it $1bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted. â€œWe always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,â€ he said, at a shareholdersâ€™ meeting.  In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit. If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillersonâ€™s retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career. â€œTrumpâ€™s choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it,â€ said Thomas Wright, who has written extensively on Trumpâ€™s foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. â€œTillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe. â€ Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump said: â€œTo me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well. â€ Lest there be any doubt about which players the   had in mind, Trump added: â€œHe does massive deals in Russia not for himself, but for the company. â€ In a very real sense, Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces. As a state, it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin. â€œReporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens, it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude,â€ said Steve Coll, who wrote about the company in a book, Private Empire. â€œThey have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations, and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too. They make people nervous, they make people afraid,â€ Coll, now a journalism professor at Columbia University, told Texas Monthly. Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil, however. For a start, Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate. Even before Trump announced his decision on Tuesday, leading Democrats were painting Tillerson as a Moscow stooge. The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter: â€œRex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the presidentâ€™s cabinet. â€ With a slim   majority, it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillersonâ€™s job in doubt. He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks, led by John McCain. â€œI have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer, but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then itâ€™s the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no,â€ the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday. McCainâ€™s former chief of staff, Mark Salter, was far more blunt on Twitter. â€œTillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad,â€ he wrote. â€œShould be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor. â€ Even if Tillerson would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy. He would face a striking culture clash with the institution, the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy, which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee, retired general James Mattis, who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscowâ€™s assertiveness in Europe. Nevertheless, Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center, argued: â€œTillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war. â€œNot just in   relations: a   foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests, rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology. â€ Trenin added: â€œIt would be   and   not averse to the use of force, but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat. In one word: realist. â€ That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin, whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers, run by strongmen like himself. Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for. â€œThe paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values, but that would be a disaster for Russia,â€ said Kozyrev, who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington.  â€œWhy? Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine   â€¦     or in Syria is actually in American values   â€¦     that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy. â€œThe realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts. If you look at this with a cold eye, you say: â€˜Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine,â€™â€ Kozyrev said.  â€œLook at Syria.

Caring about a 401K, buying a home. Sitting through the speeches as a guest at 35 weddings, listening to the youths of people I knew and relatives being eulogized by their parents and friends, I used to wonder when I, too, would reach the turning point in my life where my youth would be tied up in a tidy, hilarious narrative  â€”   â€œat seven, she objected to the signing of biblical songs in her public school music classâ€. If I didnâ€™t get married or have children, I wondered, when would I be declared a grown up? As my cohort  â€”   I like to call us â€œGeriatric Millennialsâ€  â€”   makes the inexorable trot towards middle age, it seems to me that the defining line of youth and maturity comes not with marriage (declining in importance, unnecessary for families to be built) children (more optional than they once were) or career (uncertain, changeable). Rather, the more universal experience is one that rarely bears conversation until it actually happens: our role in the transition of our parents in their   lives. Itâ€™s fair enough that people ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, and not how they plan to deal with clearing out the accumulated detritus of a lifetime in a family home, or supporting parents as they strive to live their best lives after retirement, the loss of partners, or through illness. When my father died of cancer early in 2014, I was another unwilling inductee into the club of people whoâ€™ve lost parents at an age that wasnâ€™t young, exactly, but which still felt too soon. After a while I came to realize that, if you love your parents, thereâ€™s probably never a time that feels ideal. Even so, I found that these were the people from whom I received the best insight and empathy about the long road ahead: not just the grieving process, but of the shocking realization that as adult children, we were on our own in ways weâ€™ve never been before. Iâ€™ve never felt older than I did this week: partly because I celebrated my 35th birthday, but more because I spent the day helping my mother, along with my sister and    to move into a new home 4, 000 miles from the one that she shared with my dad. Itâ€™s been a long process, from the immediate aftermath of my fatherâ€™s death, to the huge amount of work that my mother had to do to clear out our family home. You canâ€™t, I learned, hang on to all kinds of items from your childhood in the hopes that in your retirement years youâ€™ll pull them out of a box and spend ten minutes finding them charming theyâ€™ll neither bring back your youth nor the people who they remind you of. (We also learned that no one really wants to wear or buy a coat made out of a pony thatâ€™s been dead for a century). Watching my mother unlock the door to her new home, back in the city where she lived when she met my father about 40 years ago, I thought about all of the times that she watched, but did not interfere with milestones in my progress to independence. The first time I drove a car on my own in the winter (into a snowbank). The time she left me for my first night in my college dorm (I begged the next morning to be taken home and enrolled in the local university). The time I was dropped at the airport to catch a bus to a larger airport so that I could emigrate to a different continent (our local airport was small). I felt proud of my mother, but I also felt scared: nervous about leaving her to start her new life so far away from where I live. I know Iâ€™m going to have to suppress my worry about her wellbeing, her happiness, whether sheâ€™s eating enough vegetables. I guess this is what it feels like to be an adult.

The company will invite visitors to don headsets allowing them on to virtual farms, where they can drive a tractor and help harvest the potatoes for its fries. They can also go behind the scenes with a virtual tour of supplier farms producing eggs, milk and beef for McDonaldâ€™s 1, 250 UK restaurants. The roadshow, which begins next week, is the one that was recently banned by Labour from its autumn party conference. Labourâ€™s move, deemed by critics of its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to be evidence of â€œa snobby attitudeâ€ also lost the party revenues of Â£30, 000. McDonaldâ€™s at the time said it was disappointed by the decision  â€”   it has been allowed by the Tories and SNP to set up similar stands at their conferences. Technology developers, young farmers and experts from the leading agricultural university Harper Adams have been enlisted to create the roadshow, which McDonaldâ€™s hopes will reach up to 1 million people at farming shows and other events across the UK over the next year. The â€œFollow our Foodsteps experience will make its first stop at the Balmoral show, in Northern Ireland, for three days next week, and will also visit the prestigious Royal Bath  West and Royal Highland shows in June. â€œAs a nation, we have never been more focused on food,â€ said Connor McVeigh, director of supply chain at McDonaldâ€™s UK. â€œAs one of the biggest customers of British and Irish farming, we want to lift the lid on the passion and skills that exist at every stage of the process, from farm to  . â€ The initiative comes amid staff unrest at the chain, marked by a global day of action in April, when   workers protested over pay and conditions in 40 countries. In the UK, through its   Fast Food Rights campaign, the bakersâ€™ and food union BFAWU (Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union) is fighting for a Â£10 an hour minimum wage for all staff.  McDonaldâ€™s is one of the biggest single customers of British and Irish farming  â€”   working with more than 17, 500 farmers  â€”   but wants to help its customers better understand its supply chain while challenging outdated stereotypes in farming.  A YouGov poll of 2, 000 consumers for the chain found 74% wanted to know more about where their food came from, but one in five could not explain any food production process. Two in five (41%) had never been to a working farm, despite national initiatives such as Open Farm Sunday. The initiative was given a cautious welcome by the National Farmersâ€™ Union. Its chief food adviser, Ruth Mason, said: â€œThis innovative approach to connecting consumers with food production sees McDonaldâ€™s UK build further on its efforts to demonstrate the vital role that farmers and growers play in its supply chain. However, we would like to see it improve its UK sourcing in some food sectors, particularly with chicken, where it is currently only 10%. â€ The roadshow is the latest move by retailers to try to connect consumers with the realities of   farming in the UK.  In what it claimed as an industry first, Waitrose used a â€œcow camâ€ to capture scenes from a Berkshire dairy farm for its current TV advertising campaign, with other adverts focusing on a farm producing   eggs and fishermen who supply Waitrose fresh fish counters.

Downing Street said the UK has already taken a â€œconsiderable number of unaccompanied minorsâ€ and several hundred more children and young people would be arriving in the coming weeks. The government has taken about 274 child refugees this month, mostly those with family ties to the UK under the Dublin regulation. David Cameron also promised earlier this year to take an unspecified number of vulnerable child refugees from France, Greece and Italy after coming under pressure to accept an amendment to the law from the Labour peer Alfred Dubs, who was rescued in the second world war Kindertransport evacuation. But May is still facing calls from French politicians, some British MPs and charities to speed up its processes and take more unaccompanied minors who had been living in the Calais camp but are now being transferred across France. Hollande revealed on Saturday that he had pressed May to take Britainâ€™s fair share of the 1, 500   children left in Calais who are due to be been dispersed to reception centres throughout his country. He spoke to May to ensure that British officials would â€œaccompany these minors to these centres and would play their part in subsequently welcoming them to the United Kingdomâ€. â€œTheir transfer to Britain is urgent,â€ he added. â€œWe ask you to take your responsibilities and assume your moral duty by immediately organising their arrival. â€ It is understood the phone call between Hollande and May centred on practical steps required to process the childrenâ€™s claims after they have been relocated to specialist reception centres. But sources said the prime minister did not make any new commitments to France that the UK would take in more child refugees, saying it was already taking action in accordance with the Dublin regulation and Dubs amendment. A No 10 spokesman said:â€œWe are firmly committed to working with the French to safeguard and protect children who remain in Calais  â€”   and that includes transferring eligible children to the UK safely and as soon as possible. â€œWe have already transferred a considerable number of unaccompanied minors to the UK so far this year, and as the home secretary told parliament this week, several hundred more children and young people will be brought to the UK in the coming days and weeks. â€ The dismantling of the Calais camp began last week and is expected to be complete by the end of Monday. A final service at a makeshift church in the camp took place on Sunday, attended by a small number of refugees and migrants who have not been transferred to reception centres across France. By the weekend, around 5, 000 people had so far been evacuated. A 1, 500 remaining unaccompanied minors were housed in a camp made from shipping containers, before they are transferred to reception centres around France. The announcement dismayed charities, which warned the dispersal policy could mean that many children might attempt to run away from the authorities out of fear. UK Home Office officials had expected to process the childrenâ€™s applications in Calais. However, a source told the Guardian on Saturday that â€œthe French have pulled the plugâ€ on the scheme.",483,651,9.35E+17,fake

Seeing as this column was written before the Turkey Day games, Iâ€™m going to need you to delete as appropriate from the following two options: â€˜Wow, what a great set of games yesterday. Who knew that Kirk Cousins could also kick field goals?â€™  Or: â€˜The less said about yesterdayâ€™s games the better. Still, pretty amazing to see Kirk Cousins land a punt inside the 20.â€™  When youâ€™re done with that, please join me in congratulating davelewis9, DrUHomes and YorkiePoo on becoming the only three players to predict all six games correctly in week 11. And then get on with making your picks for our latest round of games: The Chargers have scored the   points of any team in the league, and yet they occupy last place in the AFC West. The Texans have scored the   points of any team in the league, and yet they lead the AFC South. Of course, those numbers donâ€™t tell the whole story but they might tell us more than simple   records.   collapses have cost San Diego dear, but this team has not lost any game by more than one score. The loss of defensive tackle Brandon Mebane to a torn biceps is significant, but offset part by the returns of safety Jahleel Addae and linebacker Denzel Perryman during the bye week. Houstonâ€™s perfect   home record does give me pause, but in the end I just donâ€™t fancy Brock Osweilerâ€™s chances of keeping up with with Philip Rivers.  Chargers to win, The Bengals could hardly be in any worse shape as they enter the last chance saloon. At    they are not yet out of contention in the AFC North  â€”   where no team is better than    â€”   but a loss to division leaders Baltimore would just about do it. This was probably not the idea moment, then, for Cincinnati to lose both AJ Green and Giovani Bernard to injury. If there is one thing going for the Bengals, it is that they have dominated these rivals in recent    â€”   winning five straight   . And the Ravens are not exactly flying right now. After opening the season   they have won just two of their last seven  â€”   and one of those was against Cleveland. Still, it is hard to move past the fact that Marvin Lewis and his staff were struggling to get the Bengalsâ€™ offense going even with a full set of weapons at their disposal.  Ravens to win, How many ways have the Cardinals found to shoot themselves in the foot? From botched snaps on   field goals, to blocked punts and kicks (sometimes in the same game) they have consistently found ways to lose games they should have won. In Minnesota last weekend, they mostly outplayed the Vikings, but wound up suffering a   defeat after giving up touchdowns on both a   interception and kickoff return. There is still the seed of a good team in there somewhere. David Johnson has been possibly the most impressive back in the league, thriving despite a porous offensive line, and the defense is giving up the fewest yards of anybody. If they could put it all together, they would be capable of beating Atlanta. But will they? Of course not.  Falcons to win, The image of Luke Kuechly exiting the field on a cart, slumped forward with tears in his eyes, during Carolinaâ€™s win over New Orleans last Thursday was harrowing for reasons that go far beyond wins and losses. Nevertheless, from a sporting standpoint, his presumed absence this weekend  â€”   and it would be an astonishing development if he did emerge from the leagueâ€™s concussion protocol to play on Sunday  â€”   will damage the Panthers immensely. The teamâ€™s sacks leader, Mario Addison, is also expected to miss out after suffering a foot injury in the same game, and cumulatively that is a lot to lose in a showdown with one of the NFLâ€™s more potent offenses. Throw in the fact that the Panthersâ€™ formerly reliable running game has ground to a halt in recent weeks, and a tall task starts to look unscalable.  Raiders to win, Was that a blip, or a warning sign for Kansas City? Many had questioned whether the Chiefs were as good as their record suggested  â€”   they now sit at   despite ranking in the   of the league for both total offense and total defense  â€”   but few expected them to lose at home to Tampa Bay. This team has traded heavily on its ability to generate turnovers, but the Broncos are not far behind on that front, and will be boosted by the return of Aqib Talib. The cornerback has three interceptions in seven starts, although his impact on Denverâ€™s secondary runs much deeper. When he plays this season, the Broncos give up an average of just 175 passing yards per game. When he doesnâ€™t, that figure rises to 255. 7. The Chiefs were never likely to air it out at Mile High Stadium, but given that they have not fielded a   rusher since week six, they cannot rely entirely on the ground game, either.  Broncos to win, After four consecutive defeats, the Packers travel to face a Philadelphia team that has a perfect   record at home. Are there any reasons to believe that they turn things around at the Linc? Maybe. One of Green Bayâ€™s greatest deficiencies (admittedly, out of many) during this recent slide has been a shabby pass defense, but even this   and bumbling secondary is unlikely to be carved apart by the likes of Nelson Agholor and Dorial  . It is also true that, despite decidedly uneven performances, the Packers have continued to put points on the board.

politifact14718,https://nypost.com/2017/11/06/ex-friends-say-shooter-was-creepy-atheist-who-berated-religious-people/,Texas church shooter was a militant atheist,"Zayn Malik is publishing an autobiography at the age of 23. Penguin Random House confirmed the British singerâ€™s â€œfirst autobiographyâ€ entitled Zayn, will be published worldwide on 1 November. Rather than pages of written narrative, however, the book will feature his thoughts, drawings and personal photographs. â€œIâ€™m going to show you as much as I can so that you can judge me on my own terms, not on what the press or anyone else says,â€ said Malik in a statement. Malikâ€™s celebrity ascent has been rapid: as one fifth of One Direction, the boyband discovered on the television show The X Factor in 2010, the group went on to headline stadiums around the world. After various run ins with tabloid media, Malik announced his departure from One Direction in 2015, firstly as a result of doctorsâ€™ orders, but then to pursue life as a â€œnormal 22 year oldâ€.  Since then, Malik has found success on his own as an RB solo artist. Despite support from fans, Malik has been sparing in his public statements since leaving the pop group.

politifact15512,http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/pope-calls-for-world-wide-gun-confiscation-except-for-the-un/,Pope Calls for World Wide Gun Confiscation Except for the UN,"Hacked emails from the personal account of Hillary Clintonâ€™s top campaign official, released by WikiLeaks on Saturday, show some of the attention her team paid to courting African American voters. There were worries about Vermont senator Bernie Sandersâ€™ appeal to that historically Democratic voter group and angst over whether Clinton should give a speech on race relations. A South Carolina Democratic party official voiced concerns that Clinton hadnâ€™t visited a particular region of the state. The emails were stolen from the email account of John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as part of a series of   computer hacks of Democratic targets that US intelligence officials say were orchestrated by Russia, with the intent to influence the 8 November election. It was impossible to authenticate each hacked email that WikiLeaks published, but Democrats have openly acknowledged they were hacked and have not pointed to any specific case where an email was altered to inflict political damage. Some of the emails released on Saturday concerned a debate over whether the candidate should give a speech on race. Chief speechwriter Dan Schwerin emailed Podesta, communications director Jennifer Palmieri and others in February 2016 to say that, as conceived, the speech would demonstrate Clintonâ€™s â€œsustained and comprehensive commitmentâ€ to improving race relations and her lifelong sympathy toward the plight of minorities in the US. Both former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton were clear that the speech shouldnâ€™t be â€œa big mea culpaâ€. The former president also said: â€œWe shouldnâ€™t try to defend the indefensible. â€ Schwerin said adviser Minyon Moore had raised tough questions about the wisdom of making the speech because it could â€œunintentionally end up elevating questions that arenâ€™t yet being widely asked and introduce new damaging information, especially super predator, to a lot more votersâ€. In a 1996 speech about Bill Clintonâ€™s crime bill when she was first lady, Hillary Clinton described young people in gangs as â€œ â€. Some African Americans find the term offensive and have sought during the campaign to hold her accountable for it. Hillary Clinton has said she regrets using the term. After a â€œgut checkâ€ conversation with Moore and talks with policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris, Schwerin said in the email that the campaign hierarchy was â€œmostly persuadedâ€ by Mooreâ€™s concerns. Instead, he suggested, a decision to push the supreme court nomination issue could replace the race speech. Schwerin closed his memo with the idea that â€œif weâ€™re slipping fast, maybe itâ€™s worth rolling the dice and doing the speech. If weâ€™re holding relatively steady, maybe we see if we can ride this out without doing the speechâ€. Clinton offered a detailed plan to overcome racial disparities in a February speech in Harlem. In an apparent effort to court young African American voters in South Carolinaâ€™s Pee Dee region, meanwhile, Clinton staffers promised Jamie Harrison, the stateâ€™s Democratic party chairman, that his area would not be overlooked. They also offered up some bold names in black entertainment who could stump for votes. In an email from 28 January 2016, Brynne Craig, deputy director of state campaigns for Hillary for America, summarized a conversation with Harrison, who was unhappy that Clinton had not visited the Pee Dee region, the   corner of the state, about 100 miles east of Columbia, the state capital. Craig said he assured Harrison that such a visit was a top priority for the former first lady or her husband. Clinton visited the region in late February and later won the stateâ€™s primary. Craig said Harrison also mentioned the need to bring younger surrogates into the state, not just   and older politicians. He said he offered Harrison a partial list of black entertainers who had been asked to travel to the state, including singer Usher, actors Anthony Anderson and Gabrielle Union and athletes Alonzo Mourning and Grant Hill. Craig wrote: â€œI feel confident we will be able to increase the amount of surrogates we have in South Carolina  â€”   more importantly the RIGHT kind. â€ Worries about Bernie Sandersâ€™ appeal to black voters remained strong throughout the primary, although Clintonâ€™s support from that group remained strong. In a July email, Podesta fretted to other campaign staffers about Sanders, who had challenged Clinton through to the end of the primary process with an   Street,   message with strong appeal to progressives. In the email, Podesta wrote: â€œHeâ€™ll be at Sharpton rallies pretty soon,â€ referring to civil rights activist Al Sharpton. â€œStill think we should do something with him on VRA [Voting Rights Act] anniversary. â€ Sanders visited Dallas and Houston in July for a series of   meetings in southern cities to help boost his support. Clinton called in to Sharptonâ€™s nationally syndicated radio show on the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act on 6 August, to appeal to African Americans to turn out to vote during the primaries. Her support among African Americans in the south helped her gain a big delegate advantage over Sanders.",658,165,"992530484008706048	992530613969223680	992532976658472960	992561874016358402	992725698992361472	992727643152887813	992787546366267393	992793277832355840	992801006714007554	992826552042876928	992892373163130880	992964128963735552	993093113194348544	993095424679563265	993130393078501376	993167592121622528	993186010228899840	993186007402012672	993233461006782469	993263323549401094	993282418940497920	993287326666313728	993309273609392128	993309362331553792	993362689677131777	993397745443639296	993424984008724480	993426659616403456	993470187017064448	993479109576667136	993534248459161600	993534957581750273	993541961826099200	993554339930300417	993567339995172864	993646884161024001	993679360493309952	993713018998525952	993735711000936449	993736808772046848	993848159960002560	993930750360670208	994002585878171648	994046134929641472	994112494250668033	994298141967970304	994365551651803136	994740033327267841	994983770091646981	995067079509278721	995465405476024320	995517009487126529	995725956458385410	995896072668098560	996553231869267968	996684788709945345	996686005439811585	996824104127918080	996870870156173315	996879579171229696	997120213815410688	997225260750602241	997477976030707712	997720287327260675	997895151593967616	998004001030443009	998113751579623424	998186689427333120	998203332643753984	998595648864899072	998679005355167744	998937291937714176	998971789664505857	999059179120799744	999129095408635904	999274135166640129	999430151808208896	999588686948978688	999594812985634816	999832138479472641	999948466796154880	1000574109120593920	1000695899281031168	1000766454281768961	1000805474684588033	1000826756083933184	1000922002369245184	1001176557266919425	1001229322445840386	1001547706697908224	1001644710446927873	1001646913358385153	1001906633721729025	1001930212760793088	1001952059225190400	1001955669812154369	1001973420106682368	1002175923414855680	1002658162619572224	1002700640278069248	1003170956943155200	1003207926901714944	1009421328397586432",fake

So we shouldnâ€™t be too surprised that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, whose economic policies can broadly be described as a big goofy mess, has managed to hit the nail on the head with at least one critique. And it happens to be an important one for the wallets of most Americans.  On Labor Day, Trump said that the Federal Reserveâ€™s   interest rates have created a â€œfalse economyâ€ and that â€œat some point the rates are going to have to change. â€   Thatâ€™s hardly   news. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserveâ€™s team of policymakers, and her colleagues agreed to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade since December. But they also passed up a handful of opportunities to hike rates further, while events beyond their control (Chinaâ€™s economic struggles, unexpectedly anemic US economic data, the Brexit shock) forced them to the sidelines on other occasions.  When interest rates are that low, thereâ€™s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market. And thereâ€™s no other reason to invest in stocks except the fact that thereâ€™s no other place to put it that might earn a reasonable return.  Translation? At this stage, the geriatric bull market is hooked on cheap money from the Fed, not fundamentals. Which means all those records you keep reading about the SP 500 index and other market bellwethers setting simply arenâ€™t justified. That, in turn, means that Trump has correctly pointed out that the Fedâ€™s policy of flooding the market with cheap money, via   interest rates, is creating a speculative stock market bubble. You remember how the last one of those  â€”   in housing  â€”   ended, donâ€™t you? Yes, exactly.  The Fedâ€™s policymakers seem to be terrified of what will happen when they begin normalizing interest rates. Perhaps theyâ€™re right to worry, because almost certainly weâ€™ll witness a big hit to our stock and bond portfolios simultaneously.  Bond prices will fall because thatâ€™s what happens whenever interest rates rise  â€”   they move inversely, because the value of the fixed interest payments on those existing bonds declines as new bonds are issued at a higher price. Stocks will lose value because by this point in the geriatric bull market, the chief element supporting them is the fact that rates are low  â€”   the argument in their favor is a relative one rather than an absolute one, that stocks are alluring in their own right. Pundits of all kinds have been making that argument for months now, pointing out that stocks are expensive. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, downgraded stocks of all kinds to â€œunderweightâ€ in early August and noted that the median valuation for an SP 500 stock was in the 98th percentile. Kostin anticipated a 5% drop in the months following his note to clients, but in its immediate aftermath, the SP index only went on to post new highs.  Investors who are looking at their statements and celebrating really should send the Fed flowers and chocolates in gratitude.  But these gains arenâ€™t happening because of a robust improvement in corporate fundamentals across the board. In the second quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters     SP 500 corporate profits actually declined 2. 2.%. Stripping out   energy companies improved the picture somewhat and resulted in a   increase in profitability of 2. 2%. But the reality is that weâ€™re in the midst of a prolonged period in which profits are barely growing, and corporate revenues are shrinking  â€”   and yet in which stock prices are roaring higher. Thatâ€™s counterintuitive.  In fact, one analyst has calculated that low interest rates can explain 93% of the first eight years of the stock marketâ€™s bull run, from March 2008 until March 2016.  So, Trump is right: the Fed has spawned a bull market, and quite possibly one that has spun out of control.  During the Republican primary season, some other isolated bits of   common sense surfaced from Trump, including noting that low rates arenâ€™t always such a bad thing, especially if you happen to be running a business or otherwise in need of debt financing. â€œThe best thing we have going right now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that arenâ€™t being done, amazingly,â€ he said. Toss out the mangled syntax, and what Trump is suggesting is that we squandered the opportunity to borrow at a low cost and reinvest in innovation and infrastructure.  In Trumpâ€™s worldview, of course, the Fedâ€™s reason for keeping rates so low for so long was political. Yellen and her predecessors were trying to make Barack Obama and his economic policies look good.  They did so by getting us all hooked on monetary crack: cheap money, via low interest rates. Debt became inexpensive (if we could get it from the banks) and stocks (for those of us with the cash to invest) were guaranteed to go higher because, letâ€™s face it, what else was everyone else going to invest in? It was a great way to transform a speculative market  â€”   stocks  â€”   into what was very nearly a sure thing.  In fact, if the Fed is in anyoneâ€™s pocket, itâ€™s likely to be that of the treasurers of Fortune 500 corporations. The minute that policymakers raise interest rates, swoosh, in will come a lot of capital from overseas, in search of the higher yields they could get on   US Treasuries. Zoom  â€”   up would go the US dollar in response. And that crashing sound? Well, that would be the reverberations from the plunge in corporate profits.  As Iâ€™ve already pointed out, revenues and profits are already under pressure, and nearly half (about 48% to be precise) of revenues at SP 500 companies come from overseas. If the dollar goes up in value, every pound, euro, yen, etc that they earn overseas will be worth fewer dollars. The Fed has a mandate to keep unemployment levels stable, and you can be reasonably sure that theyâ€™re aware that a sudden plunge in earnings would lead to layoffs. They donâ€™t need Obama to whisper into their ears. Hillary Clinton chose to seize the moment that Trump finally said something sane and sensible to scold him, warning him not to comment about what the Fed does â€œwhen you are either running for president or you are presidentâ€. She went on to warn: â€œWords have consequences. Words move markets. Words can be misinterpreted. â€ Not Trumpâ€™s, clearly. The market has plodded along ever since he made his remarks, apparently oblivious to his views of the Fed and the market. Trump isnâ€™t Warren Buffett, BlackRockâ€™s Larry Fink or David Kostin of Goldman Sachs.  Itâ€™s a pity, because this time heâ€™s right. It may not happen very often  â€”   we may not see it again on an issue of real substance during this campaign. But this is a stock market bubble that has been inflated by the Fedâ€™s easy market policy. You donâ€™t have to believe that the Fed is politicized to agree on that diagnosis. You should accept that this is what weâ€™re confronting, however  â€”   and prepare for the fallout whenever it ends.",177,875,"898360623670730753	898458348449824769	898477703770361856	898539384395321344	898702448142860288	898987188687298562	898987522763538432	899255801625407488	899469847096176641	900025503637135365	900039333545115648	900750379880722440	900779179897114624",fake

Rescuers have brought more than 150 people ashore and recovered 43 bodies, including several women and a child, and hundreds more are missing, according to local officials and news agencies said.  â€œWe are deeply concerned at reports that hundreds of people may be missing at sea,â€ said Matthew Saltmarsh, spokesman for the United Nationâ€™s refugee agency, UNHCR. â€œEvents like this highlight the importance of rescue operations as part of the response to the movement of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean and the need for real, safer alternatives for people needing international protection. â€  Like most boats used for human trafficking, the ship that sank not far off the Egyptian coast appeared to have been dangerously overloaded, security officials said. Smugglers operating from Egypt often use old fishing boats for the long journey to Italy. Manypassengers are crammed below deck, with little chance of surviving if the boat sinks. â€œInitial information indicates that the boat sank because it was carrying more people than its limit. The boat tilted and the migrants fell into the water,â€ a senior security official in northern Beheira province told Reuters. He said the dead were mostly Egyptian, Sudanese, Eritrean and Somali nationals. Relatives of missing Egyptians gathered at a coastguard post to wait for news within hours of the tragedy. â€œI am not going to leave until I see Mohamed,â€ Ratiba Ghonim told Reuters, as she mourned her    brother. â€œIt is his destiny to leave yesterday and come back dead today. They still havenâ€™t pulled his body out of the water. â€ The tragedy is part of a growing human trafficking problem out of the country. Neighbouring Libya is still the starting point for most efforts to reach Italy by boat from north Africa but, after years of lawless chaos in the region, a rising number of people are setting out from Egypt instead. In the first seven months of this year, Italian data showed that the number of migrants who reached the country by boat from Egypt was nearly 70% higher than the same period of last year. Arrivals from Libya fell slightly. A safer embarkation point has not made the journey itself any less perilous. Thousands of people have lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean, with nearly 3, 000 dead or missing in the first eight months of this year, according to UN data. The deadliest month was May, when hundreds of people died in three separate incidents that overwhelmed rescuers. In June, more than 300 migrants who had set off from Egypt died when their boat capsized near Crete. Rescue services are patchy, a mix of privately funded operations and an EU   mission that helps out with rescues when needed, but is not officially assigned to search and rescue operations. Charities have warned that the Mediterranean is becoming a â€œmass graveâ€ as Europe looks away from tragedy. Crossings from Turkey to Greece fell dramatically after an   pact earlier this year, that aimed to deter prospective migrants by promising the deportation of most people arriving through that route. Several thousand people are still risking that voyage each month and experts say only the prospect of safe and effective resettlement schemes will stem the flow of people risking their lives. At the summit in New York this week, the US president, Barack Obama, announced that a coalition of more than 30 countries had agreed to concrete measures to tackle the refugee crisis. They include a commitment to double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4. 5bn, provide education to 1 million more refugee children and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults.

It has been a week of endless questions and limited answers  â€”   how? why? And, perhaps most important of all: what now? More specifically, some have wondered whether Donald Trump would have been defeated if he had faced a different Democratic candidate: Bernie Sanders. On Wednesday, CNN journalist Wolf Blitzer asked Jane Sanders, wife of the former candidate for the Democratic nomination, if her husband would have had a better chance of beating Trump than Clinton. â€œAbsolutely,â€ she replied, â€œbut it doesnâ€™t matter now. â€ Thereâ€™s mixed evidence for that certainty.  In the primaries, Sanders gained more votes than Clinton in Wisconsin and Michigan. Those are important states. Wisconsin, a formerly Democratic state, was narrowly won by Trump in the presidential election on Tuesday. In Michigan, the race was even closer, with Trump winning by just 11, 837 votes (which represents 0. 25% of all votes cast there). If Clinton had won just 109, 000 more votes in those states (plus Pennsylvania where she also narrowly lost) we would be calling her, and not Trump,  .  But that is a big â€œifâ€ for a number of reasons. Perhaps Sanders would have won Wisconsin and Michigan but lost Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota and New Hampshire  â€”   states that were only narrowly won by the Democratic party in the presidential election. Itâ€™s true that Sanders won all of those states except Nevada in the primary season but thereâ€™s a much larger caveat here: voting behavior in the primaries is different to voting behavior in the presidential election.  If we canâ€™t rely on primary vote counts to gauge Sanders chances, weâ€™re not left with much else besides polling  â€”   a deeply flawed analytical tool. Nevertheless, itâ€™s understandable why one of those polls is now being widely circulated. It found that in a race between Sanders and Trump, Sanders would have won with 56% of the vote. The national poll, which spoke to 1, 600 registered voters two days before the general election was conducted by Gravis Marketing. Even more than most polls, that one is deeply flawed because it asks individuals to consider an alternate reality where Sanders was a nominee. Considering completely hypothetical and   choices encourages some unrealistic answers in surveys  â€”   otherwise 27% of US adults would waterboard someone suspected of terrorism. Slightly better then is polling which regularly asks a far less hypothetical question: â€œDo you have a favorable opinion of candidate X? â€. The answers to that question are crucial in understanding why 2016 was no ordinary election year: Clinton and Trump were two of the most unpopular candidates US voters have ever been told to choose between. That dislike seemed to endure right up to the end of election season.  The story for Bernie Sanders though looks very different (the strength of that feeling might explain why, in Vermont, Sandersâ€™ home state and one he has served as Senator since 2007, 18, 183 voters decided to write his name into their ballot as their presidential choice): More accurate perhaps is polling that asks about broader attitudes rather than people (if we had more such polling in the lead up to the election, perhaps the campaigns would have been more focused on policies).  One such attitude seems important in this election: trust in government is at a historic low according to research by Pew Research Center and 81% of likely voters said that federal government was corrupt according to a survey by Rasmussen Reports in February. (It should be noted that trust in mass media is at a historic low too).  Although Bernie Sanders has 34 years of political experience under his belt and Donald Trump has zero years, both candidates campaigned as outsiders and used   rhetoric regularly in their speeches. Thatâ€™s potentially important for votes because more Americans identify as Independent today than at any time in the last few decades. In 2015, Gallup found 42% of US adults said they were independent, compared to 29% who said they were Democrat and 26% who said they were Republican.  There is one major drawback to all of these numbers though: they were collected before Donald Trump won a US presidential election  â€”   in the face of even the most trusted predictions. Everything is different now, and if Sanders were to test the numbers by competing against Trump in 2020, he will probably be doing so in a very different set of circumstances.  â€¢ This article was amended on 16 November 2016. An earlier version said Sanders had won several named states in the primary season except Colorado. He won those states except Nevada.

politifact15564,https://babylonbee.com/news/senate-democrats-demand-supreme-court-nominee-not-be-unduly-influenced-by-u-s-constitution/,Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution,"Equity is likely one of the more realistic financial sector films out there because I had no idea what the hell anybody was talking about. Well, thatâ€™s not exactly true. Director Meera Menon and her three leads, Anna Gunn, Sarah Megan Thomas and Alysia Reiner, extract the drama from Amy Foxâ€™s screenplay while still leaving the jargon intact. I donâ€™t know squat about IPOs (if I did, Iâ€™d be on my yacht) but I do know a juicy morality play when I see it, and Equity takes us inside modern Wall Street in a unique and gripping manner. You may have noticed that all the names listed so far are women. That this is a â€œfemale lookâ€ at Wall Street is more than a marketing gimmick. Like our main character Naomi Bishop (Gunn) this movie strives to make it on its own terms, avoiding opportunities to draw attention to it being any less of a corporate thriller than one starring men. Of course, when your lead is, in fact, a woman, as is her (perhaps untrustworthy)    (Thomas) as well as the old college chum now working for the government investigating securities fraud (Reiner) we are seeing this familiar world through new eyes. New for film audiences, that is, not new for actual working women for whom announcing pregnancy is met with a steely â€œcongratulationsâ€ which implies â€œyour career is over, how dare you knife me in the back this way?â€ The actual plot of Equity is, to a degree, less interesting than the keenly observed moments of the world of high finance. Bishop is a big shot banker who brings companies in on their initial public offerings. Again, I donâ€™t precisely know how this works, but Menon makes every scene understandable to dunces like me who will never know the difference between buying stocks or playing roulette. Bishopâ€™s last deal went bust because the client decided, at the last minute, that he didnâ€™t trust her. The rumour is as simple as he didnâ€™t like her dress. But this new company, a new social network run by an obnoxious pipsqueak in a hoodie (Samuel Roukin) is going to make everyone a zillion dollars. There are, however, a few problems. Bishop discovers from a hacker (another woman) that the new company is not quite as impervious to attack as they claim. Then thereâ€™s Bishopâ€™s boyfriend (James Purefoy) who is some other kind of banker, but is corrupt, and tries to squeeze info out of Bishop. She wonâ€™t offer it up, though. She is ruthless in business, but never dishonest. But her long   assistant might be the weak link. Meanwhile Samantha the investigator (who has two children and a female partner back home) uses her female wiles with men to snoop around for illegalities. This all builds to a sequence where everyone runs around the floor of the stock exchange shouting: â€œBuy! buy! buy!â€ but by this time youâ€™ll realise that no matter what the outcome is, this is a toxic and irredeemable system. (Much like steroids in sports, isnâ€™t just time to assume that everyone making real money on Wall Street is using insider info?) There are a number of fascinating themes to chew on in Foxâ€™s script, but for me nothing tops watching Bishop tussle with the knowledge that her companyâ€™s product may be flawed. The implication is all about how it will effect the deal and her perception in the companyâ€™s eyes, and if sheâ€™ll be indemnified once the service is inevitably revealed to be bunk. Not once does the issue of screwing over the consumer come up. Keep in mind, this is the good guy weâ€™re talking about! All of the performances are top notch, and if thereâ€™s any justice Equity will propel Anna Gunn to   status. The only    characters, actually, are the men. Purefoy is just a boy version of a femme fatale, and Alyssa Reinerâ€™s cheap   partner is straight from central casting. Is Meera Menon so dedicated a feminist that sheâ€™ll intentionally make the male characters   to counteract that hundreds of movies with bland wives and girlfriends? Probably not, but for a movie all about deception for a bigger payoff, Iâ€™d like to pretend that itâ€™s so.",881,449,"1012718144832638976	1012724305615032320	1012728650670567424	1012728955328192512	1012729072475148290	1012729520598781952	1012729769904009216	1012730622408839168	1012731025699590145	1012733091939536897	1012733291512778757	1012733626994384896	1012734395441143815	1012734588177797123	1012735223707131904	1012747498488725504	1012752028756533248	1012752112005124096	1012768272435982336	1012768868195012609	1012778460912275457	1012790348408655872	1012803259965288449	1012808864063021056	1012814558933630977	1012815202876870657	1012822949781561346	1012838674785034240	1012843028787138561	1012847269022875648	1012855301752664064	1012856507996594176	1012863284238745600	1012881405414707200	1012898154994380800	1012913500098891776	1012913511888977920	1012956151468748801	1013056194573946885	1013070058648526848	1013098295915249664	1013099496899784706	1013106089133592577	1013110153099468800	1013111835006922752	1013121316386426880	1013153506692403200	1013191199136604160	1013192317090476032	1013221805371211777	1013442625444171776	1013443328015261696	1013463313928392704	1013471163446710273	1013507123693654018	1013522113519607808	1013542417126100993	1013563837658882048	1013566473154056192	1013568803270250496	1013573816075685888	1013625258690207744	1013756306598047744	1013762031755948033	1013781723556007937	1013810640430010374	1013812994659274755	1013813566661709826	1013816475327651842	1013817303027322882	1013818454233804800	1013832215527116800	1013841793778094081	1013854287615746051	1013880588468551681	1013894039341490180	1013911688708542465	1013922540572626945	1013960676359000066	1014003556750422016	1014140376242950149	1014142712885284864	1014146116986732544	1014147299524530178	1014168823107411969	1014216575833071616	1014286823642750977	1014312027941109760	1014313098902228992	1014495515873042432	1014608423550365696	1014660837334831104	1015504419004141570	1015925191166185473	1016308254417174529	1016361244381581313	1016385162224066560	1016406883270135808	1016406930711928832	1016407349630722048	1016795875425779714	1016842865752854528	1017745459367038979	1017751523374313472	1017823705232113664	1017826868769288192	1018991474711515136	1019371729666367488	1021757502885646338	1022073354860343296	1025433169338740736	1025553577190641664	1025580184563535872	1025608106519289856	1025881513987072000	1025974276179087360	1026170272704094208	1026251030781194240	1026359851440631808	1026540123347775488	1026886840144543745	1027015342281904128	1027948253751533569	1028264860700667905	1038437227288768512	1038576399970459648	1040583300862169088	1041543261645688833	1047843821130801157	1047980692540461056	1051519604609220609	1053325799745568768",fake

The rise of celebrity culture did not happen by itself. It has long been cultivated by advertisers, marketers and the media. And it has a function. The more distant and impersonal corporations become, the more they rely on other peopleâ€™s faces to connect them to their customers. Corporation means body capital means head. But corporate capital has neither head nor body. It is hard for people to attach themselves to a homogenised franchise owned by a hedge fund whose corporate identity consists of a filing cabinet in Panama City. So the machine needs a mask. It must wear the face of someone we see as often as we see our   neighbours. It is pointless to ask what Kim Kardashian does to earn her living: her role is to exist in our minds. By playing our virtual neighbour, she induces a click of recognition on behalf of whatever grey monolith sits behind her this week. An obsession with celebrity does not lie quietly beside the other things we value it takes their place. A study published in the journal Cyberpsychology reveals that an extraordinary shift appears to have taken place between 1997 and 2007 in the US. In 1997, the dominant values (as judged by an adult audience) expressed by the shows most popular among   to 11   were community feeling, followed by benevolence. Fame came 15th out of the 16 values tested. By 2007, when shows such as Hannah Montana prevailed, fame came first, followed by achievement, image, popularity and financial success. Community feeling had fallen to 11th, benevolence to 12th. A paper in the International Journal of Cultural Studies found that, among the people it surveyed in the UK, those who follow celebrity gossip most closely are three times less likely than people interested in other forms of news to be involved in local organisations, and half as likely to volunteer. Virtual neighbours replace real ones. The blander and more homogenised the product, the more distinctive the mask it needs to wear. This is why Iggy Pop was used to promote motor insurance and Benicio del Toro is used to sell Heineken. The role of such people is to suggest that there is something more exciting behind the logo than office blocks and spreadsheets. They transfer their edginess to the company they represent. As soon they take the cheque that buys their identity, they become as processed and meaningless as the item they are promoting. The celebrities you see most often are the most lucrative products, extruded through a willing media by a marketing industry whose power no one seeks to check. This is why actors and models now receive such disproportionate attention, capturing much of the space once occupied by people with their own ideas: their expertise lies in channelling other peopleâ€™s visions. A database search by the anthropologist Grant McCracken reveals that in the US actors received 17% of the cultural attention accorded to famous people between 1900 and 1910: slightly less than physicists, chemists and biologists combined. Film directors received 6% and writers 11%. Between 1900 and 1950, actors had 24% of the coverage, and writers 9%. By 2010, actors accounted for 37% (over four times the attention natural scientists received) while the proportion allocated to both film directors and writers fell to 3%. You donâ€™t have to read or watch many interviews to see that the principal qualities now sought in a celebrity are vapidity, vacuity and physical beauty. They can be used as a blank screen on to which anything can be projected. With a few exceptions, those who have least to say are granted the greatest number of platforms on which to say it. This helps to explain the mass delusion among young people that they have a reasonable chance of becoming famous. A survey of    in the UK revealed that 54% of them intend to become celebrities. As soon as celebrities forget their allotted role, the hounds of hell are let loose upon them. Lily Allen was the mediaâ€™s darling when she was advertising John Lewis. Gary Lineker couldnâ€™t put a foot wrong when he stuck to selling junk food to children. But when they expressed sympathy for refugees, they were torn to shreds. When you take the corporate shilling, you are supposed to stop thinking for yourself. Celebrity has a second major role: as a weapon of mass distraction. The survey published in the IJCS I mentioned earlier also reveals that people who are the most interested in celebrity are the least engaged in politics, the least likely to protest and the least likely to vote. This appears to shatter the mediaâ€™s frequent,   claim that celebrities connect us to public life. The survey found that people fixated by celebrity watch the news on average as much as others do, but they appear to exist in a state of permanent diversion. If you want people to remain quiescent and unengaged, show them the faces of Taylor Swift, Shia LaBeouf and Cara Delevingne several times a day. In Trump we see a perfect fusion of the two main uses of celebrity culture: corporate personification and mass distraction. His celebrity became a mask for his own chaotic, outsourced and unscrupulous business empire. His public image was the perfect inversion of everything he and his companies represent. As presenter of the US version of The Apprentice, this spoilt heir to humongous wealth became the face of enterprise and social mobility. During the presidential elections, his noisy persona distracted people from the intellectual void behind the mask, a void now filled by more lucid representatives of global capital. Celebrities might inhabit your life, but they are not your friends. Regardless of the intentions of those on whom it is bequeathed, celebrity is the lieutenant of exploitation. Letâ€™s turn our neighbours back into our neighbours, and turn our backs on those who impersonate them.

Just ask Jerry Miller, founder of FarmersOnly. com, the dating site aimed at anyone who doesnâ€™t count themselves as a city slicker. But Miller is thrilled when people stumble on his delightfully goofy commercials for the site. â€œPeople go on YouTube and Twitter and say it is the stupidest commercial, you have to watch it, and it spreads virally, and the jingle gets into peopleâ€™s heads,â€ explains Miller. The websiteâ€™s first commercial, which has now been viewed over 1m times on YouTube, was made by going around local farms with a digital camera and asking the farmers he met to play its loveless subjects. These days, he can rattle off the celebrities that have gently poked fun at the site and its advertisements from Ellen Degeneres to Carrie Underwood to Carmelo Anthony.  All that ribbing has translated into five million subscribers across the US and Canada since the site launched in 2005 with its silly homemade commercial and the tagline: â€œCity folks just donâ€™t get it. â€ The site attracts an even split of men and women and an age range across the spectrum, from young people looking for their first relationships to those looking to remarry after getting a divorce or being widowed. Miller, who works in agricultural marketing, got the idea to start the dating service when he kept meeting lonely farmers through his work. Living in a rural area where the nearest neighbor is miles away and everyone knows each other does not leave a lot of dating options. Suburban sprawl has wiped out a lot of small farms near urban centers, Miller explains, leaving fewer farms and farmers in the US. â€œThey call us flyover country,â€ says Miller, â€œyou look out the window when you fly from New York City to Los Angeles, and in the nighttime you see a couple of clusters of twinkling lights, small communities in the middle of nowhere. â€ Itâ€™s not just the isolation and lack of choice that makes finding companionship difficult in rural areas, say Miller. It is also the rural lifestyle. Miller points to the original copy he wrote for the homepage of his site, in which he categorized all Americans into two groups, those in â€œhigh heels, blue suits, taxi cabsâ€ and those who like â€œwide open spaces and blue skiesâ€. While he recognized that his generalizations are just that, the odd hours and lack of weekends of farm life donâ€™t make for easy dating. One of the original farmers who inspired Miller to start the site told him she tried regular online dating, but when prospective suitors would invite her to coffee at 9pm, she would have to explain that she needed to go to bed around that time so she could be up early to feed the animals, and the potential relationships would fizzle before they began. Miller, the rural dwellerâ€™s biggest cheerleader, also cites a lack of understanding of not just the hours but the importance of farming and ranching by those outside the community as a hurdle to dating. A rancher Miller knew went to a singles party at the nearest city and when he told women he was a rancher, they looked at him in confusion. â€œThey did not respect him and it hurt his feelings, so he never went back,â€ says Miller.  â€œThese people donâ€™t understand where their food comes from,â€ Miller tells me, indignantly. â€œThey donâ€™t respect all the hard work it takes to bring food to market. â€ Not everyone turns their nose up at a rancher. Some tend to romanticize farm life  â€”   after all who hasnâ€™t dreamed of giving up the rat race for a life cavorting with goats on a   hilltop, but reality can make for a rude awakening. Magazines like Modern Farmer with articles on miniature pigs and the joys of raising alpacas can make the lifestyle seem Pinterest perfect, but â€œyou donâ€™t just sit on the front porch and drink iced teaâ€ Miller points out.  Reality TV shows like the Fabulous Beekman Boys, about a successful couple from the city who gave up their careers to raise goats for milk, can make farming look easy, but the lifestyle shift would be difficult for most who were not raised with it. The dairy farmers Miller knows talk about not taking a single day of vacation for over 15 years, working seven days a week to keep their farms going. These days Miller happily points to marriages that resulted from his website between   individuals. While Miller does not push marriage, and is in fact happy if his site can provide companionship of any kind to subscribers, even if it is just someone to email, he is firmly against his site being used to facilitate hookups. In keeping with his emphasis on what he calls â€œserious relationshipsâ€ Miller rails against what he considers a high divorce rate, unsurprisingly attributing it to people with different backgrounds marrying each other. Despite all his    talk and bewilderment when it comes to anyone working 9 to 5 in a   office (Miller seems unable to comprehend how I can enjoy living in New York City) Miller himself bucks one stereotype of rural people. His website is for all rural dwellers, including gay and lesbian ones. It seems the days of Brokeback Mountain are long gone. At least when it comes to farmers, ranchers and other rural dwellers, â€œwe are for everyoneâ€ Miller explains.",365,490,"887013620042936321	887158984041390080	887279450165006336	887542186920771584	889531987509133316	898897098434904064	900292330707574784	922819740611080194	925724076064362496	925724085425975296	925772831681601537	925788115276587009	925941642443612160	926085177134247938	926138703977832448	926176230319251456	926234713290764289	926279746098548736	926354506232709120	926505281021911040	926513083010375680	926678087407931392	926810349097095168	926891208848429056	927214181324955648	927220847844188160	927279381537361921	927361945463939072	927362021171048448	927512951095021568	927519240126697472	927535967606657025	927607893054164996	927631027190816768	927964121441632256	928233073522683904	928262316080037888	928321324954435584	929172677000089600	929177394736492544	929811139508158464	929857288600473600	929924188684587009	930182929392766978	930515471211773953	930793103375470594	930843361384185856	930949977014263808	931170575782948864	931172298895319040	931343521159753728	931680299234275328	931680637756506112	931713307458920448	931721046746652672	931768195765211136	931872333253488640	931969110551830528	931981466782896128	932008481686720515	932008508027015168	932157800305881088	932316696286707712	932317729276784640	932318140184309760	932334301257129984	932340540166868993	932340744597266432	932355626080055296	932363346191507456	932372103785013249	932426981727019008	932428924897890305	932429452461641729	932429894851575809	932432640933801985	932446893635973120	932447057734000641	932474238304387072	932602859455111168	932603145162653696	932611891209424896	932650130880294913	932916048575176704	932994746687029249	933000362147110912	933003308834291717	933003378577235968	933003434634002432	933043687897968640	933058540201267200	933105314446143488	933167458650939393	936035800533303296	956261792807755776	956261815134117890	956261950920515584	956262188880093184	956262293553197057	956263497179934720	956280166141124613	956281286787846146	956282571326763008	956283802984308737	956286316832018433	956295939114889216	956308244129075200	956310139916693504	956310388190208001	956310689903194114	956312708277817344	956327458436870144	956366389874393088	956375573823152128	956411746457145345	956414755828314112	956432107970224128	956444265235865601	956518547840208896	956520015192363008	956528940633423872	956553609751261185	956572018304061441	956577161929895938	956579349116878849	956590173927673856	956639892574015488	956685383609221122	956700119256182784	956713274116059137	956731455203241984	956793909052628992	956805863804579840	956805867344625664	956919871165685760	956927072173096962	956983895974608896	957033562783526912	957044042503806978	957047486669041665	957088290682884096	957095783483965442	957126627309293568	957140414263451648	957234305784139776	957424926402605056	957446641279295494	957514256605417472	957669282321707008	957681682856980480	957697532322373632	957725754573324293	957732424263315456	957823646516613120	958004819884675073	958019577115500544	958043848202182656	958155115990536192	958164045026095104	958175253141876736	958194718403383297	959231962673287169	959866247302320128	960509317848842242	963432635799408640	964580864851144704	965221831077777408	965221940268011520	965221998245957632	965222150427828224	965222626670112769	965609422893363201	967554224266629122	967691390778998784	967870290599522305	968181734373195776	968188101414731776	968191932676628481	968205262556418049	968225618927280128	968226040567939073	968226697261867008	968233404083908608	968242426568757249	968247618978512898	968279384250466304	968283187175714816	968317760831881216	968336877983010817	968345215714123776	968345324069752832	968360832525656064	968363826302406658	968363871617671168	968364103222865920	968424749717250048	968435647252922368	968454862559219712	968461171542999041	968462699049955328	968506029716705281	968511769760051200	968536052859219968	968537758473113601	968538195297292288	968639662762815488	968663478360793088	968692522661941255	968879982377422848	968921108400562176	968923793459728384	969239946598014978	969298937831153665	969315825550163968	969615415134605312	969648046475763712	970146195778621440	970526545243721728	970715446788927489	970736491105341441	970997571559804929	971006245699141632	971131062058336257	971132109078212608	971135202620837891	971135672538095616	971228570868682753	974790527739670529	975008951195455488	975154803335720960	975155677588082688	975161776747708417	975164550432657408	975165525398638593	975199498799591424	986749875583766528	986753029989781504	986995971895844864	987029327576535041	992156300443357185	992418452366340096	1009086284428709889	1009490076420726784	1009790469805502469	1010189588692811778	1011363159502925824	1012955156974055425	1013211968524546048	1013947837955133441	1014959341655470081	1018932896000806914",fake

In partnership with music video director Mondino, he created the   cover portrait for BjÃ¶rkâ€™s acclaimed first album, Debut. Blame had requested that BjÃ¶rk simply bring her favourite clothes from her own wardrobe for the Paris shoot. However, when the airline lost her luggage (â€œshe walked into my hotel room carrying just a model of a boat, a little satin Martin Margiela dress and a big pair of bootsâ€) they changed plan and headed to Margielaâ€™s showroom. â€œSheâ€™d talked a lot about the fact the album was quite techno but she wanted to look like a little animal, so I just yanked that little furry jumper off Martinâ€™s rail. Then [the French   artist] Topolino came in and put those two sequins under her eyes and that was it  â€”   the full stop!â€ recalls Blame. And so pop musicâ€™s inimitable cyber pixie was born: a   synergy of quiet vulnerability and extrovert determination. Surreal, subversive and typically Gaga, the infamous meat dress (painstakingly crafted from real slices of meat) that she wore to the MTV music awards in Los Angeles in 2010 divided commentators: was it an artistic statement with a feminist agenda (women as meat) or   dig at the   fashion and music industries? Franc Fernandez, who was originally commissioned to create a meat purse, developed the idea into a into a   dress, and drafted in the family butcher to bring it to life. Grace Jones collaborated with French art director, filmmaker and then lover   Goude to create performances, album art and music videos that propelled her   image into the stratosphere. The cover for the album Nightclubbing (1981) boasts the image Goude believes most truthfully crystallises his overall vision of her  â€”   a fearless modern hero, with extreme, subversive beauty. Jones boasts a sharply structured   a black,   Armani suit (later retouched to look more extreme) and a torso so sculpted that the    could be male or female. Her skin is inky black (Goude painted it black then overlaid it with blue powder to deepen the look) her lips dark red  â€”   countered by the sleek stick of a white cigarette. â€œIt was about extremity, playing on her masculinity. Grace simplified to the maximum,â€ says Goude. While Jennifer Lopezâ€™s persona was inarguably built on sexually charged charisma, stylist Andrea Lieberman, who put Lopez in a   Versace dress for the Grammy Awards in 2000, said it was about reclaiming ownership over that sensuality. The Get Right video is a vision of sports luxury way before the term â€œathleisureâ€ was coined in 2014. Together, they constructed an identity so popular that Lopez kickstarted global trends such as the Juicy Couture velour tracksuit (Iâ€™m Real, 2001) and the Manolo Blahnik,   stiletto boots (Jenny from the Block, 2002) inspiring a whole generation of emerging female   artists. One of â€œ â€ stylist Anastasia Maranoâ€™s most significant relationships has been her work with the outspoken    songwriter, rapper and general creative agitator MIA. The pair worked together on a series of stage shows and festival performances, including her appearance at the 2009 Grammy awards when nine months pregnant. It was a   moment thanks to a bodycon Henry Holland monochrome mesh minidress with strategically placed polka dots. Echoing heavily pregnant Neneh Cherryâ€™s appearance on Top of the Pops two decades earlier, MIA accessorised it with hotpants and   Reebok trainers, unapologetically subverting the conventional    stereotype. â€œIt was a really special moment in her life,â€ says Marano. â€œShe had a major song, Paper Planes, a album and a baby. The dress was actually a very sexy dress to start with she wanted to look more like an artpiece. â€ After redefining the suit in the suavest, slinkiest form for public appearances, couturier Antony Price next collaborated on Roxy Musicâ€™s artwork. One of their most notable album covers is For Your Pleasure featuring Amanda Lear, stalwart of the 1970s club scene,   to Salvador DalÃ­ and friend of Bryan Ferry. Sheathed in black latex and holding a panther on a leash, Lear poses in film noir meets art provocateur Allen Jones style. The enigmatic Lear was a fitting symbol for a band who were carving out a niche as popâ€™s perfect artefact. While these images were sometimes criticised for bordering on the chauvinistic, the designs coincided with the emergence of the first international supermodels, glamazons with heavenly bodies, formidable characters and the aura of a stratospherically unattainable lifestyle, and cemented the bandâ€™s legacy. â€¢ This is an edited extract from Fashion + Music by Katie Baron (Laurence King, Â£30).

The Americans were taking part in the annual Port Huron Float Down on Sunday in the St Clair river, which runs between the US state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario.  The winds blew the flotilla of inflatable rafts and inner tubes off course and towards the Canadian shore. Some rafts deflated, spurring a rescue effort by the Canadian coast guard as well as federal and provincial police, coast guard spokeswoman Carol Launderville said in an email.  Most â€œfloatersâ€ had to be rescued from the water, with many towed to shore, according to the coast guard.  â€œThey were terrified of entering another country without documentation. No one carries their passport or any ID, and a lot were drinking alcohol,â€ Peter Garapick, superintendent of search and rescue for the coast guard, told CBC television.  Some tried to swim back to the United States.  â€œWe had to pull a lot of people out of the water and say â€˜noâ€™,â€ Garapick said.  The Americans were gathered at Sarnia, Ontario, and bussed back to the United States by the cityâ€™s public transit.  Sarnia police did not say whether anyone was charged in the incident, and only minor injuries were reported.  Launderville said the event has no official organizer and poses â€œsignificant and unusual hazardsâ€ due to the riverâ€™s   current and participantsâ€™ lack of life jackets.  A Facebook page for the event, which dates back more than 30 years in the city of Port Huron, west of the border from Sarnia, made a post on Sunday night thanking Canadian authorities.  â€œYouâ€™ve shown us true kindness and what it means to be amazing neighbors!â€ the post read.  The Facebook page appears to be operated by a group named Port Huron Float Down, which says on its website it is not an organizer.

Lauren Seitz, 18, died last Sunday after she was exposed to the amoeba at the US National Whitewater Center (USNWC) a   center where she went with a church group earlier this month. According to officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Seitz died of a rare brain infection caused by the amoeba naegleria fowleri. â€œInitial test results found naegleria fowleri DNA was present in the whitewater system,â€ the USNWC said in a statement. At a press conference, Mecklenburg County health director Marcus Plescia said most of 11 samples tested by the CDC this week showed preliminary evidence of the amoeba. â€œOn behalf of the USNWC, I wish to express our sincere condolences and sympathies to Lauren and her family,â€ chief executive Jeffrey Wise said in a separate statement. â€œOur focus is always on stressing safety and risk in the most appropriate manner possible. â€ State health officials noted that the amoeba is common in warm lakes, rivers and springs in summer, and said in a statement that it does not cause illness if swallowed, but can be fatal if forced up the nose. The   organism does not survive in saltwater and cannot infect a person who drinks contaminated water.  In the event of brain infection, the amoeba causes illness up to nine days after exposure. Symptoms include headache, fever, vomiting, confusion, seizures, loss of balance and hallucination. Death usually follows within five days. The fatality rate, according to the CDC, is more than 97%. The CDC stresses that infections are extremely rare. In the last 53 years officials recorded only 138 infections in the US, compared with about 10 drowning deaths a day over the last decade. Millions who swim in lakes and rivers every year without infection.  â€œIn other words, there are no outbreaks,â€ Wise said. In the last decade, 33 people were infected during recreational activities and three by contaminated tap water forced up the nose  â€”   prompting warnings about the use of Neti pots for nasal irrigation. One person was infected by contaminated water on a backyard Slip â€˜N Slide.  Deaths in recent years have occurred in Texas and Louisiana  â€”   southern states where warmer waters are more habitable for the amoeba  â€”   though the amoeba have also been found in the north. According to the USNWC, Seitzâ€™s â€œonly known underwater exposure was believed to be when riding in a raft with several others that overturnedâ€ at the center. State and CDC officials are investigating the death with the centerâ€™s cooperation. The USNWCâ€™s water is sourced by county utilities and two wells on its premises. Wise said the water is disinfected with ultraviolet radiation, filtered and periodically given a dose of chlorine. It has weekly water tests carried out by a   lab, he added. â€œThe levels of UV radiation disinfection utilized every day, continuously, at the center are sufficient to â€˜inactivateâ€™ the   amoeba in question to an effective level of 99. 99%,â€ the   said in a statement.  But Wise admitted inherent danger.  â€œDespite every measure we take, there is always a risk of injury or harm based on the very nature of what we do and who we are,â€ he said. â€œWe are deeply saddened any time harm occurs as a result. â€ James Seltz, the victimâ€™s father, sent a statement to an Ohio affiliate of NBC, describing her as a talented musician and writer who cared deeply about nature. â€œOur family is completely heartbroken and lost without Lauren,â€ he said. â€œIt is unacceptable that a person who loved nature so much, and was so passionate about environmental issues should be taken from us in this way. â€ The center remains open for activities unrelated to the whitewater rafting. Health officials said people should hold their nose shut or keep their heads above water when in warm freshwater areas, and should avoid water activities at times of high temperature and low water levels. The amoeba can also be found in sediment and wet soil, meaning people should avoid digging or disturbing sediment in areas where the organisms are often found.",202,855,"926133843924578304	926142608518283264	926227707356221441	926253322515943425	926261133652168704	926299416658628609	926386092437377030	926429917948076034	926429937145393152	926497306072973313	926503913695559681	926506079969861632	926518536197025793	926695138067341312	926772043781111809	926856426814877696	926978680336867328	927004103720529920	927024973939691520	927182599964983296	927354592567939072	927363615895715841	927497181384314881	927523851675856896	928094021750312961	928101343201517568	928162767957307392	928322938637516801	928330530843709440	941449294636371970	941678080468377600	941734205503033344	941758076104912897	941760250813829125	942059433743605760	944092177692491776	944164032239378432	944264872568803328	944264870454792193	944264870408720384	944312831759015941	944474490116898817	944474533859418112	944992862957076482	945336155276316672	945476614162407424	994055322821185536",fake
politifact14273,https://politicalmayhem.news/state-minnesota-just-handed-full-control-muslims-can-take-infidels/,State Of Minnesota Has Just Handed Over FULL CONTROL To Muslims So They Can Take Down ‘Infidels’," The worldâ€™s whaling watchdog has voted to conduct stricter reviews of whales killed under an exemption to a    moratorium which Japanâ€™s critics say it abuses to hunt for meat.  The resolution on Thursday, opposed by Japan and fellow whalers Norway and Iceland, was adopted by 34 yes votes to 17 against, at the 66th meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). It is not legally binding on members of the commission, which has no policing or penalty function. Submitted by Australia and New Zealand, the resolution seeks to â€œimproveâ€ the review process for scientific whaling programmes  â€”   which Japan alone conducts, netting more than 15, 000 of the marine mammals since 1986. â€œWe welcome this result as an important reaction to Japan unilaterally issuing its own permits for   scientific whaling,â€ said Matt Collis of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. â€œWe all know that scientific whaling is sham science, and simply commercial whaling by another name. â€ Japan defended its annual Southern Ocean whale hunt, saying it was gathering scientific data. The country insisted its actions were in keeping with a 2014 ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which found that permits issued by Japan were â€œnot for purposes of scientific researchâ€ and instructed the country to halt its Jarpa II programme. â€œReports oftentimes say (that) irrespective of the ICJ judgment Japan started the research, or in violation of the ICJ judgment . .. and thatâ€™s not true,â€ Japanâ€™s commissioner to the IWC, Joji Morishita told fellow delegates. In the judgment of the court itself, â€œit is clear that the ICJ assumes there can be future research activities,â€ he insisted. â€œThe ICJ also said . .. that the use of lethal sampling per se is not unreasonable in relation to the research objectives,â€ Morishita added. After the court ruling, Japan cancelled its   hunt, only to resume it the following year under a new programme called   (New Scientific Whale Research Program in the Antarctic Ocean). It killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean  â€”   many of them pregnant, according to observers. The Southern Ocean hosts one of two whale sanctuaries in the world. The issue is a deeply divisive one at the biennial meetings of the IWC, which turned 70 this year. The meat from Japanâ€™s hunts ends up on supermarket shelves and in restaurants, in line with an IWC stipulation that whales taken for research must be eaten. Under the IWC moratorium, all whaling other than for aboriginal subsistence, or science, is prohibited. Japan hunts under the science exemption, while Norway and Iceland lodged formal objections to the moratorium and continue commercial hunts. New Zealandâ€™s commissioner Amy Laurenson expressed her countryâ€™s â€œdeep disappointmentâ€ with Japanâ€™s resumption of whaling without IWC approval. Japan had referred   to the IWCâ€™s scientific committee, but started whaling before it could complete a review, she said, and accused Tokyo of sidelining the commission. â€œOn the basis of the information the commission has before it, it is clear that   is not in fact for purposes of scientific research,â€ the commissioner argued, and called on Japan to â€œcease the lethal component of  â€. â€œJapan has still not justified the use of lethal sampling,â€ she said. For Kitty Block of the Humane Society International, Thursdayâ€™s vote shrank the scientific whaling â€œloopholeâ€. â€œWith its continued defiance and its unfettered whaling, Japan is not just killing whales but making itself a true outlier in the community of nations,â€ she said.",581,657,"878949351376265216	878956676275204096	878957154161618944	878966192446201856	878966215917613056	878977645962067968	879119581549342720	879167353728098305	879170751840104448	879181846160039937	879333592756649984	879437034443722753	1055721704893415424	1056094962985693184",fake

politifact15137,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/miley-cyrus-donald-trump-is-a-fking-nightmare-20160302,Miley Cyrus: 'Donald Trump Is a F--king Nightmare',"Drizzle welcomed festivalgoers on the first day of Governors Ball, with Elle King on the main stage doing her best to engage soggy fans. Her 2015 single Exâ€™s  Ohâ€™s does the job, with the poppy rockabilly and Kingâ€™s louche stage presence leading to a mass singalong. Elsewhere, Alicia Bognanno and the rest of Bully impressed fans on the Big Apple stage with their 90s   piercing through the poppier strains of Meg Mac on the adjacent stage.  Tracks such as I Remember, Trying and Too Tough jolted the early crowd into action, with a small circle pit forming and disbanding in unison with the bandâ€™s   compositions. On the main stage, Christine and the Queens delivered a theatrical performance that was part   and part pop party. In a grey suit, Christine entertained listeners with Michael   dance moves accompanied by her backing dancers, and covers of the   Chaka Khan hit I Feel For You and Kanye Westâ€™s Heartless.  Years  Years delivered their   from the Honda stage, with lead singer Olly Alexander battling with a damp keyboard to get through covers of Katy Perryâ€™s Dark Horse and Drakeâ€™s Hotline Bling. Action Bronson was probably the most raucous act of the weekend. At one point, he threw a watermelon over his head, narrowly avoiding his DJ, the Alchemist, before shouting out to fans from Queens who had made the short trip, offering the stage presence of an ornery shopkeeper after the end of a long week. Tracks like Action Silverado had the crowd singing along and laughing at the same time. Now more than ever, the Strokes evoke that sliver of time in New York between the death rattle of grunge and   at the fore of a   revivalism that brought forth acts like the White Stripes and the Vines. All but three songs from 2000â€™s seminal Is This It? were worked into Friday nightâ€™s exhilarating headlining gig, a dramatic if not wholly unexpected departure from a Tuesday   gig chock full of deep cuts in nearby Port Chester. Thatâ€™s not to say the coolly dispassionate Julian Casablancas and co  â€”   who took the stage 25 minutes late (in sunglasses, natch)  â€”   didnâ€™t include a surprise or two during an   set. Between   renditions of erstwhile singles The Modern Age, Someday, Under Cover of Darkness and Juicebox came a cover of the Clashâ€™s Clampdown that had been on the shelf for more than a decade. There was also the tender dedication of Electricityscape to the Canadian artist Brett Kilroe, a friend of the band who designed several of their album covers (as well as the cover of Olâ€™ Dirty Bastardâ€™s Return to the 36 Chambers) who died of cancer in March. Two new tracks from the   Future Present Past EP blended seamlessly with the old material. Yet it was the signature moments  â€”   including Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr trading hilly, melodic guitar lines on Last Nite  â€”   that turned Fridayâ€™s finale, only two years after the band last headlined here, into a rollicking New York City hit parade. A humid Saturday afternoon, and all seemed well midafternoon as festivalgoers chugged away on 24oz cans of Miller Lite gently warming in the humidity. They were watching the excellent Thundercat, whose real name is Stephen Bruner. Brunerâ€™s impeccable musical pedigree goes from playing bass in Suicidal Tendencies to performing with Erykah Badu from putting out two   albums on Flying Lotus to becoming a pivotal part of Kendrick Lamarâ€™s musical team on To Pimp a Butterfly. He was unashamedly muso, but never   stretching out songs like Lotus and the Jondy into a   explorations of psychedelic soul. â€œIs this Governorâ€™s Island?â€ he inquired at one point. â€œAre we still in New York?â€ Thundercat has the ability to take us into a whole other zone.  Over on the main stage, LA   Lord Huron tiptoed the line between beguiling beauty and earnest blandness in a slot that seemed a bit too big for them. It was time to head over to the opposite corner of the festival, where De La Soul were about to teach some lessons. â€œWhoâ€™s under 30?â€ demands their DJ, Mason, adding to the cheering crowd: â€œI love your energy, but youâ€™re going to learn some shit today. â€  The rap trioâ€™s 1989 album 3 Feet High and Rising expanded the parameters of   with a dazzling sampladelic style, surreal humour and a lyrical refusal to be hemmed in by the macho tropes of the time. Almost three decades later, songs like Say No Go still sound inspired, while later work like Ooh Ooh Ooh and A Rollerskating Jam Named Saturday have a technicolour vigour that delights the crowd, even those too young to remember their â€œdaisy ageâ€ heyday. â€œEverybody on crack right now, make yourselves known,â€ they joked from the stage, absolutely confident in their own dextrous ability to conjure a party out of thin air. They might have been sandwiched between Thundercat and Miguel, but De La Soul proved that they still sound ahead of their time, their kaleidescopic sonic palette having barely dated.  Miguel himself was wearing a psychedelic poncho, but the rain gods nevertheless seemed displeased  â€”   it bucketed it down so hard that a good chunk of the crowd fled to underneath the nearest tree to get some shelter. The rain continued to hammer down right through Miike Snow, the collaboration between the Swedish producers Bloodshy and Avant (famous for hits including Britney Spearsâ€™s Toxic, not to mention their EDM project Galantis) and the American songwriter Andrew Wyatt, who has collaborated with a bewildering combination of people, ranging from grubby indie types (Carl BarÃ¢t, the Big Pink) to perky pop stars (Pixie Lott, Bruno Mars). As if to showcase their songwriting versatility, their set ranged from the sleek, strutting pop of Genghis Khan to the fuzzy Swedish pop of Sylvia, concluding with the 21st century Sting of Animal. This   also meant their performance seemed more like a somewhat dilettante DJ set than the work of a band with a specific identity, though the faithful   moshers at the front of the stage clearly couldnâ€™t have cared less.  The first fat drops of rain fell only minutes into Miguelâ€™s   set on Saturday at Governors Ball and quickly graduated to a   summer storm, but those who braved torrential conditions that might have spelled disaster for lesser performers were treated to a gripping set of   neosoul that rated among the truncated festivalâ€™s undisputed highlights. Clad in a knit poncho, torn white jeans and heeled boots  â€”   like a character from some lost interstellar spaghetti western  â€”   the   Los Angeles native baptized the crowd with 75 minutes of spacey RB and that drew heavily from last yearâ€™s critical smash Wildheart. After opening with A Beautiful Exit and The Thrill, the skies opened for the coy sex anthem Sure Thing off the Los Angeles nativeâ€™s 2010 debut, All I Want Is You, immediately sending passersby scurrying for cover. Yet several thousand fans remained for a   set that seemed to escalated with energy as the conditions worsened  â€”   and worsen they did. Midway through, soggy poncho long since tossed aside, Miggyâ€™s white tee was soaked through and torn at the left armpit, clinging to his chiseled abs. â€œLove the rain!â€ he exhorted between bars of Coffee, finally tearing the shirt off and powering through the climax. He writhed and gyrated and bopped with verve, delivering lyrics supine, missing nary a note and playing to the crowd with an effortless charisma. A brief cover of 2Pacâ€™s I Get Around offered a   surprise, while a   rendition of Adorn  â€”   the Kaleidoscope Dream smash that earned him a Grammy in 2012  â€”   left the crowd in awe. â€œIâ€™ll never forget that time we danced in the rain together,â€ he said near the finish before launching into a   How Many Drinks?  â€”   the club banger powered by liberal samples from Kendrickâ€™s Swimming Pools  â€”   that saw him descend from the stage and deliver a   climax surrounded by   listeners. At the front of a   summer that includes stops at Bonnaroo, Londonâ€™s Wireless Fest, Pitchfork and Outside Lands, Saturdayâ€™s rapturous reception augurs well. The Killers closed Saturday with an     set of their safe, overwrought pop rock, drawing exclusively from their back catalogue despite rumblings of a new album in the works. A predictable laundry list of their greatest hits (Mr Brightside, All These Things That Iâ€™ve Done, Read My Mind, Somebody Told Me, Human) peppered with covers of Elvis Presleyâ€™s Canâ€™t Help Falling in Love and Obstacle 1 by Interpol, showcased an act at the height of their vapidity, which is saying something.

politifact14085,usleader.net/index.php/2017/05/11/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals/,BREAKING: Bill O’Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By ‘Tolerant’ Liberals,"DeEtta Williams is frightened every day. She stays inside as much as possible. She makes sure that she is rarely alone. She visits a therapist. She takes medication for anxiety. The man she said sexually assaulted her daily for six months is somewhere out there, and â€œheâ€™s got nothing to loseâ€. He raped her so often and for so long, the    said, because she was serving time at the California Institution for Women and he was a prison guard there. Williams has filed a federal lawsuit against officer Michael Ewell, who has since been fired, and the California department of corrections and rehabilitation. She wants her story told, she said, and she wants the world to know what happens behind bars. In the   lawsuit and in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Williams alleges that there is a pattern of sexual assault at the womenâ€™s prison and that state officials â€œknow and just donâ€™t botherâ€ to do anything about it. â€œOfficer Ewell had a history of sexually assaulting women, a history well known to CDC,â€ according to the suit, which was just filed in late July. In September of 2013, Ewell was accused of sexually assaulting â€œa fellow CDC officer, [and] was inexplicably transferred to a womenâ€™s prison. He was assigned his own unit to supervise, giving him unfettered access and power over the female prisoners in his unitâ€. Bill Sessa, spokesman for the department of corrections, said Ewell entered the agencyâ€™s training academy in 2008 and was â€œterminatedâ€ from his job at CIW on 26 May 2015 after working there for two years. â€œOther than thatâ€ Sessa said, â€œwe have no commentâ€ on the lawsuit. Several attempts to reach Ewell, who lives in Moreno Valley east of Los Angeles, by phone and email on Friday were unsuccessful. A spokeswoman for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association did not respond to a request for comment. Williams, who was released from prison on the day after Thanksgiving, lives in San Diego with her wife and her disabled    son. She has twin    sons in college and a    daughter who works with children in Louisiana. She is a home healthcare worker. In 1997, when she was a housewife in a failing marriage, she set up a drug deal that went bad. â€œSomebody ended up getting killed,â€ said Williams, who is also known as Dee. â€œI called 911 and reported it. â€ Williams was convicted of aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Williams was incarcerated in CIWâ€™s segregated housing unit in 2013, when Ewell was transferred to the Corona, California, prison from the California Institution for Men. Williams says that what began as sexual harassment  â€”   comments about Williamsâ€™ body and her â€œneed for a manâ€  â€”   segued into staring at and photographing Williams as she showered, the suit said. After Williams was transferred out of segregation, the suit alleges, Ewell engineered her transfer to a unit where he worked and had her assigned to a job cleaning the guardsâ€™ office and small bathroom, which â€œensured Officer Ewell would have isolated access to Deeâ€. He would â€œpopâ€ her out of her cell at 5. 30am, when no other officers were on shift, and have her clean the secluded area. He told her, â€œI know you want a real man. â€ He groped her. He forced her to kiss him. He pressed his penis against her when she was bent over cleaning. On Valentineâ€™s Day in 2014, he cornered her against a wall and began to choke her, the lawsuit said. He pushed her underwear aside, forcibly performed oral sex and masturbated. When he left the room, she got in the shower and sobbed. In later months, he would slap her, rape her, choke her. He threatened her children. He forced her to perform oral sex. â€œThe worst day was every day that I had to get up and face him,â€ Williams said. â€œWho could I tell? Once I was violated, I didnâ€™t feel safe. Being violated by your peers is one thing. You expect it in prison. Being violated by staff, by someone in authority, it takes a whole different turn to everything. â€œAt that point,â€ she said, â€œwho do you go to? Another staff? Thereâ€™s no protection there. Everything goes out the window. â€ Eventually, Williams said, she broke down. She lost weight. Her hair fell out. She tried to kill herself. And she told warden Kimberly Hughes that she had been raped over and over again.  â€œWhen I was talking to her about it, I lost it,â€ Williams recounted. â€œIt was in a conference room in segregation. I was yelling. I was screaming. I told her it was her fault. I told her she knew everything that was going on in the prison . .. I blamed her for everything, and her staff. I got her attention. She took action. â€ Hughes was sympathetic, Williams said. And receptive. And compassionate. She transferred Williams to a single cell and had the prisonâ€™s internal investigator get the journal that Williams said â€œhad the dates of everything that happenedâ€. CIW authorities launched an investigation into Ewellâ€™s conduct, the suit said, and Williams participated. In March 2015 she testified against Ewell in front of the state personnel board. Two months later, his employment was â€œterminatedâ€.  Earlier this month, Hughes and the warden of the stateâ€™s other major womenâ€™s prison resigned amid allegations of persistent problems, according to the Associated Press, including suicides at CIW and sexual assaults at Central California Womenâ€™s Facility in Chowchilla.  Officials at the California Institution for Women declined to comment and referred questions to Sessa. â€œI ended up in the mental ward of the prison. Thatâ€™s where I paroled from,â€ Williams said Friday. â€œI still have nightmares and panic attacks.

The Jewish delicatessen, open since 1937 and known for its gruff wait staff and massive sandwiches  â€”   its motto: â€œIf you can finish your meal, weâ€™ve done something wrongâ€  â€”   announced its impending closure in a Facebook post on Friday.  Speaking to staff in an emotional address, owner Marian Harper Levine said the stresses of running a restaurant in New York City had grown too much to bear. â€œThe restaurant business is one of the hardest jobs in New York City,â€ she said. â€œAt this stage in my life, the early morning to   days have taken a toll, along with my sleepless nights and gruelling hours. â€ On Seventh Avenue at West 55th, in midtown Manhattan and in the shadow of rising towers on â€œBillionairesâ€™ Rowâ€ the Carnegie is one of few businesses surviving from an era before rampant corporate investment and rising commercial rents. Recently, though, times have been hard. In 2014, the deliâ€™s owners were ordered to pay a $2. 65m settlement to 25 employees who alleged they had been cheated out of fair wages. Harper then went through a contentious divorce, in which she claimed her husband, Sandy Levine, had shared secret recipes with his girlfriend, whose family allegedly launched a â€œrogueâ€ Carnegie Deli in Thailand. From April 2015, the deli was closed for more than nine months after the utility firm Con Edison discovered an illegal gas line hookup that had been working for six years, similar to a hookup that caused an explosion in the East Village, killing two people and destroying Pommes Frites, another famous restaurant. A fine and a backdated utilities bill of more than $40, 000 followed. The only beef that mattered to the Carnegieâ€™s customers, though, was the meat layered lovingly in its famous sandwiches. For loyal regulars, news of the deliâ€™s demise brought heartache. On Saturday, the   comment on the restaurantâ€™s Facebook page said: â€œYouâ€™re literally a part of the fabric of NYC. â€ â€œMy kids will never know what it is like to see their first MASSIVE sandwich appear before them!â€ read another. â€œAnd the knishes! And chopped liver! Life will never be the same. â€ The Carnegie owed some of its fame to an appearance in the 1984 Woody Allen film Broadway Danny Rose, in which it was the setting for the framing device, a discussion by kvetching Jewish comedians about the adventures of the titular character, a hapless talent manager played by the director himself.  After the Carnegie closes, anyone pining for pastrami on rye and matzoh ball soup with a side of   glamor will still be able to take a cab to Katzâ€™s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side, to have what Meg Ryan had in When Harry Met Sally.",317,560,"812157455211892740	812349255104991232	812505834383114240	812653772975513600	813872573020860417",fake

Mina Justice, who was asleep and oblivious to the fact a gunman had opened fire in the Pulse nightclub, was woken up just after 2am by a text from her son. â€œMommy I love you,â€    Eddie Justice wrote on 13 June. â€œIn the club they shooting. â€ She tried to call him but there was no answer. She texted back and Eddie told her he was being held hostage in the bathroom and to call the police: â€œHeâ€™s coming Iâ€™m gonna die. â€ The pain of losing a child is profound, but hearing from them directly, just before their death, produces a more complicated kind of heartache. Those final messages force parents to helplessly relive their loved oneâ€™s   final moments, but they also become an eternal reminder of a childâ€™s love. Below, three mothers share their final connection with the children they lost, and how those words have shaped their grief. The night of the mass shooting at the Century 16 movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, Sandy Phillips received a text from her    daughter, Jessica, who was about to see the midnight screening of The Dark Night Rises with her friend Brent. Phillips had been awake for about an hour, texting and scrolling through Facebook, unable to sleep. A minute before the movie started, Jessica wrote to her mother in San Antonio: â€œGet some sleep mom. Iâ€™m really excited for you to come visit. Need my mama. â€ â€œNeed my baby girl,â€ Phillips replied. â€œHang in there. â€ In four days, Phillips was going to visit her daughter to help set up a new apartment she had no idea â€œNeed my mamaâ€ would be the last message she would ever receive from Jessica. About half an hour later, Phillipsâ€™ phone rang. When she saw it was her daughterâ€™s friend Brent, she had a bad feeling.  â€œHi baby, whatâ€™s going on?â€ she asked. She heard screaming in the background. He told her there had been a shooting and that he had been hit twice.  â€œWhereâ€™s Jessi?â€ she asked. â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ he said. â€œBrent, tell me sheâ€™s OK,â€ said Phillips. â€œIâ€™m sorry, I tried,â€ he said. â€œOh God Brent, tell me sheâ€™s not dead. Tell me sheâ€™s not dead. â€ Brent didnâ€™t answer. She screamed. Phillipsâ€™ husband rushed from the bedroom and caught his wife as her back slid down their hallway wall. What came next were not days, but a blur of grief. Every time Phillips woke up, she wondered: â€œWhy am I not dead?â€ Her only solace was the final messages exchanged with her daughter. She reread them for the first time the morning after the shooting when an ABC news reporter  â€”   someone her daughter knew  â€”   asked to see Phillipsâ€™ phone. â€œMy first thought was â€˜Thank God she knows that I love her and I know she loves me because I have that last text,â€™â€ she says. â€œSo that became very [important] to protect that text at all cost. â€ A few months after the shooting, her phone crashed. She told the technician: â€œYou donâ€™t understand how important this is, you have to save [the texts]. â€ Whenever Phillips leaves her cellphone somewhere she panics (she was unaware she could back up the texts) and when she has to get it repaired, she points to the messages and tells whoever is behind the counter: â€œThis is the only thing that matters. Do. Not. Lose. This. Text. â€ Four years after her daughterâ€™s death, Phillips and her husband have become gun control advocates. Last April, they sold most of their possessions, bought a camper trailer and hit the road. They now travel across America telling their daughterâ€™s story to organizations and others who have lost loved ones to gun violence.  Phillips usually rereads the final messages from Jessica four times per year: on her own birthday, her daughterâ€™s birthday, the anniversary of the shooting and Motherâ€™s Day. They provide comfort but can also send her down a spiral of looking at old pictures and reliving her trauma. â€œWe call it â€˜going into the pitâ€™,â€ she says. â€œItâ€™s like you get sucked under and canâ€™t get yourself back out. â€ Sometimes reading the texts can transport her back into the theater, imagining the terror her daughter will soon feel. But sheâ€™s grateful her daughterâ€™s texts werenâ€™t sent during the shooting â€œout of fearâ€. â€œIt was just â€˜I miss my mommaâ€™ and â€˜I miss you baby girl,â€™â€ she says, choking up. â€œI had no idea how much I was going to miss her the rest of my life. â€ On the morning of 11 September 2001, Anne Mulderry was at a 9am yoga class in Kinderhook, New York. She had moved into the village that summer, after her son, who worked at an investment firm in the World Trade Center, bought a retirement home for her. When Mulderryâ€™s class ended at 10. 30am, she stopped by the post office, a daily ritual, and saw she had a package.  â€œI hope itâ€™s something fun,â€ she told the woman behind the counter. â€œI hope so too on a day like this,â€ the postal worker responded, explaining that planes had flown into the World Trade Center. Mulderryâ€™s body went still.  â€œI have a son who works in the World Trade Center,â€ she said. The woman looked up from the mail, a pained expression on her face, and locked eyes with Mulderry. The mother had no idea that the south tower, where her    son worked, had collapsed at 9. 59am, but from that moment on she knew she was â€œheaded into hellâ€. In the living room, Mulderryâ€™s answering machine light was blinking red. Her first message was from Stephen, and amid the panic, he mixed up his words. â€œA building went into my plane,â€ she remembers him saying. â€œI just want to tell you that I love you. Iâ€™ll be all right and Iâ€™ll call you. â€ His normally buoyant voice was hesitant and broke a little when he said â€œI love you. â€ Mulderry knew it was a goodbye.  She listened to the other voicemails, from her daughterâ€™s fiance, friends and relatives. Her husband, who she was separated from, left a message in a voice â€œtwisted with sufferingâ€ telling her not to turn on the television. She took his advice and went to the backyard. She sat on a plastic chair underneath a maple tree and prayed for strength. â€œI knew I would be tempted to just want to die and   â€¦     I didnâ€™t want to do that,â€ she says. â€œI wanted to be strong. â€  A little while later the portable phone on her lap rang. It was her daughter Amy, who worked in a building near the towers, calling to say she was alive. Mulderry was overjoyed, but her happiness was quickly paired with pain. â€œWhereâ€™s Stephen?â€ she asked. Amy, who had heard the south tower go down after she had been evacuated, didnâ€™t answer. Mulderry let out a primitive howl. It would be some time before she would listen to her sonâ€™s final message again. Her neighbor had made CD copies from the voicemail tape, but Mulberry was reluctant to hear it. â€œI didnâ€™t want to face the fear again,â€ she says. â€œThere was a catch in his voice that allowed me to know that   â€¦     he knew he was facing death. â€ She kept the recording in a cabinet next to her television, along with tapes of Stephenâ€™s college basketball games and a recording of him singing as a child.  Mulderry, now 80, doesnâ€™t remember exactly when she first replayed the message, but she knows it took her a long time. Though sheâ€™s listened to it again since, always alone, sheâ€™s had to control her urges. â€œIf I indulged, I could listen to nothing else,â€ she says. â€œAnd that would not be a good thing for me or anyone else to do. â€  When Mulderry hears the voicemail the grief she initially felt on   returns, but the message also reminds her of her sonâ€™s integrity. Stuck in the conference room, she now knows that Stephen and his colleagues passed around a phone to say their final goodbyes. â€œHe knew he was going and his last wish was to send messages of love,â€ she says. â€œIn the midst of that terror   â€¦     they still had that human impulse to connect one more time. â€ Though her son sounds afraid, she thinks the message proves his love was stronger than his fear.  Last month, Mulderry moved from her cabin in Kinderhook to an apartment on the Upper East Side to be closer to her sons and daughters who live in the city. She burned a lot of the mass cards she received around   but put the CD marked â€œAnneâ€™s answering machineâ€ in a trunk along with other memories of Stephen.  Will Mulderry listen to the voicemail again? One day, sure, when she feels up to it. â€œI donâ€™t want to face that fear again,â€ she says. â€œBut I want to encounter the expression of love. â€  On 27 April 2014, Regina Wood was getting ready for work when she learned a tornado was speeding towards her son, Jeffrey Hunter, in Vilonia, Arkansas. The state suffers from frequent natural disasters, but the weather channel was calling this twister â€œvery dangerousâ€ and â€œvery destructiveâ€ predicting it would be the most severe of the year. The national weather service anticipated hail larger than golf balls. The    was 20 miles away and terrified for her baby boy. Before Wood was about to leave for an overnight nursing shift at 7pm, she received a troubling text from her son. â€œMama, Iâ€™m so scared,â€ wrote the    college senior who was visiting his dad and stepmomâ€™s house for dinner. â€œItâ€™s going to be a direct hit. â€  While Jeffrey hid in a bathroom, his mom stayed glued to the weather channel, texting him the exact location of the tornado as it moved through town. There was little she could do  â€”   the winds were already up to 200mph. His next text made her heart stop. â€œGoodbye mama   â€¦     Itâ€™s heading right for me. â€ Her only thought was to find him. She jumped in her car and drove towards the disaster despite the danger.  â€œI love youjeff you will make it,â€ she texted. â€œGoing to elpaso. â€ He didnâ€™t write back. She tried to call but there was no answer. She pictured his phone smashed on the ground and hoped he was still alive. By the time Wood was on the road, the tornado was wreaking havoc. It had split open houses and splayed their insides  â€”   dishes, clothes, framed pictures  â€”   all over the roads. She ignored her emotions and focused on rescuing her â€œgentle giantâ€.  Tornadoes were one of his biggest fears, and it made her sick to think how scared he must be. But as she drove on, and the extreme weather sirens started to howl, Wood realized she was entering a death trap. Big black clouds spread like ink blots across the ominous sky and lightning electrified the darkness. After 10 minutes, she turned the car around. As she pulled into her driveway, her daughter Anna called. She told her mother Jeffrey had been found dead. Wood screamed. She frantically called the hospital and police station to try and find her son but they had no information yet. She sat on her bed, still in her hospital scrubs, and reread the last messages from her son over and over.  â€œMama, Iâ€™m so scared. â€ â€œGoodbye mama. â€  â€œI kept reading them because that was my connection to Jeffrey,â€ she says. â€œI just wanted to feel [near him]. â€ As she cried, she questioned whether she had done everything possible to save him. But she was powerless against the force of nature. The tornado ended up being the deadliest of the year in the US, killing 16, injuring 193 and devastating three counties.  Wood didnâ€™t eat or sleep for days. She was stunned and completely lost.  Wood says the grief has consumed her life. Sheâ€™s retired from nursing and become more reclusive. She spends most of her time alone, watching TV, playing guitar and making jewelry, diverted only by occasional visits from her stepson in Michigan. Wood keeps the cellphone containing his messages powered off and in a safe. She reads the screenshots loaded on to her computer once a month. The messages remind her how scared Jeffrey must have been, but they also give her a sense of security. â€œI loved him very much and I know he loved me,â€ she says. â€œThat is the one solace and comfort. If a child is reaching out to you like that in the face of adversity  â€”   thatâ€™s the most blessing you could have. â€ The Orlando shooting triggers a lot of pain in her watching parents grieve transports her back to the worst moment of her life. But when Wood thinks of Mina Justice, who received the final texts from her son, she wants her to know they will become a gift over time. â€œYou will always   â€¦     know you were loved,â€ she says. â€œ[At first] all you feel is the heartache but then you think of how special he was just to be able to reach out. â€",174,608,"862157449763205120	862304212213878785	862416262869254145	862471771387199492	862611246696112128	862629336200822784	862797984106524672	862815102269087744	863008251897688064	863068589711966208	863092372921516032	863239135678447616	863249002468261888	863267867810287621	863281253331591169	863282967086456832	863294485970784256	863303478801813504	863313895825580033	863317951226630145	863318537540177920	863319971803258880	863320807166136320	863388532827721728	863401531902644225	863424292570238976	863425114687234048	863440450237079552	863471571863707649	863485133097099264	863528752336093184	863546202897481728	863555081857253377	863571857609342978	863599962898087936	863611661172613120	863627512013836288	863644008630845440	863649326840422400	863682087127105536	863691163408248832	863741399509999618	863742488640708608	863778257321066500	863798092725923840	863858772292272130	863871865420468224	863879900247326721	863986092822765568	864086537327136769	864091399100170240	864106421520027649	864164804386185216	864248000469708800	864351531000254464	864411460377563136	864426263045451776	864474323540684800	864531465211711488	864957929795055617	865220024402882561	865253459087335424	865349473454747650	865397997219205120	865457592444665857	865465837926227968	865793282718093312	865910352466386944	865936704900825090	866057132982112256	866203803514687488	866659516586348546	867509162502008837	874031643069231107	874160254321348608	880416351923220486	893971956449529856	933147054049656837	933373323844579328",fake

Neither did a number of the other women I called who had crossed paths with Donald Trump. But few of them had documented their encounters as thoroughly as Harth, whose 1997 lawsuit alleging attempted rape against Trump is a matter of public record. Harth had kept quiet for almost 20 years. But a few months after my call, her lawyer got in touch. The impetus, as Harth put it in an emotional   interview at the Guardianâ€™s New York office in July, was Trumpâ€™s repeated insistence that any woman alleging misbehavior on his part was lying.  Trump is still calling Harth and many others liars, even as the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct has risen into the double digits.  Long before crass tapes of Trump boasting about sexual groping entered the picture  â€”   and Harthâ€™s story suddenly became   news  â€”   the Guardian was the rare publication that took Harthâ€™s story seriously. We were the first to publish her account last July, even as other outlets dismissed stories like it as too frivolous or implausible. We also published the accounts of   beauty queen Alicia Machado and legally bullied Sheena Monnin, well before Trumpâ€™s mistreatment of women became the defining story of the presidential election. Harth, who charged Trump with sexually assaulting her in one of his childrenâ€™s bedrooms at his    estate in 1993, didnâ€™t come to the Guardian by chance. She came to me because she knew the Guardian was committed to telling her story and she sensed I had the time, flexibility and resources I needed to tell it. She was right. When Trump clinched the nomination last spring, my editors asked me to dig deeply into Trumpâ€™s long history of misogyny, and gave me the support I needed to do so. But the Guardianâ€™s commitment to this kind of   reporting is time consuming and expensive. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing to ask for your support by making a contribution or becoming a member. The business model for investigative journalism is broken. As comedian John Oliver explained recently in this brilliant segment, nobody in journalism has figured out a sustainable formula for making money on the internet. Online ads generate a tiny fraction of the revenue that print ads once did  â€”   and news publications like the Guardian are competing with tech giants Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue.  From Bill Cosby to Roger Ailes to Donald Trump, this election year may go down as the moment our country finally started taking sexual assault seriously. These stories found an audience because of the brave women who told them, but also because of the journalists and the editors who listened first. We did that at the Guardian, and now we hope youâ€™ll listen back.

politifact14265,https://mainerepublicemailalert.com/2017/06/24/breaking-johnny-depp-taken-into-custody-by-secret-service/,BREAKING: Johnny Depp Taken Into Custody By Secret Service,"â€œThey didnâ€™t go out in public at all,â€ says     an emergency response coordinator for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recalling a Syrian couple she met in Berlin in February. The young parents of three children  â€”   a    and infant twins  â€”   had tried to wait out the bloody civil war in Syria. But then they lost their familyâ€™s two electronics shops and home after military skirmishes, forcing them to flee the city of Homs. The couple found an apartment near Aleppo, Syria, one of the worldâ€™s most dangerous cities. They kept their children inside day and night. Then, on a rare occasion, the mother let their oldest son play on the balcony. Explosions cracked outside. The boyâ€™s scream ripped through the air. â€œShe went out, and a severed arm from a victim had flown over into the balcony,â€   says. And with that, the parents decided they all had to leave Syria. They took what belongings they could and eventually made it to Europe after crossing into Greece on a dinghy. â€œThe mother said: â€˜We were either going to die in Syria, or we were going to die on the ocean,â€™â€   recalls. â€œThey really captured why we need to offer asylum. â€ This family is part of a larger movement of refugees seeking safety. Some 4. 8 million refugees have poured out of Syria since 2011, with many traveling through Greece to countries like Germany and Sweden, which have earned reputations for being relatively welcoming to outsiders. Others from   areas such as Afghanistan and Iraq are also escaping their countries. Governments, nonprofit groups and volunteers in Europe are faced with the challenge of helping these people settle in foreign lands. Fallout from closed borders, The refugee situation has evolved significantly over the past two years. It was chaotic in 2015 as an influx of people started to overwhelm Europe. At the peak of that yearâ€™s movement, about 6, 800 refugees per day crossed into Greece, which is the closest European nation for many people coming from the Middle East. For the year, more than 1 million arrived in Europe by sea. Those figures have dipped in 2016 due to stringent European border regulations implemented in March. An average of 46 refugees per day arrived in Greece in July, and there have been 271, 218 arrivals by sea in Europe for the year. However, the border tightening has left about 57, 000   refugees stuck in Greece, often separated from family members. â€œThey donâ€™t know if they can leave, or when,â€ says Lena Panagiotarea of Athensâ€™ Volunteer4Greece, which will be renamed Ethelon in September. â€œ  percent of those are kids, and the big issue now is trying to find accommodations to help them build a proper life. â€ â€œThey feel like theyâ€™ve survived the war, and yet theyâ€™re in this state of flux,â€ adds  . The situation also has resulted in Middle Eastern host countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan becoming overburdened. Developing nations host 86% of the worldâ€™s refugees  â€”   13. 9 million  â€”   compared with 2. 2 million in places like the EU and North America.   says she believes developed countries must be more open to accepting refugees. New systems of support, Volunteer groups are offering guidance and support for refugees in these volatile environments. Theyâ€™re also working to foster an inclusive atmosphere in European communities where refugees might not be welcome, says Meridith Rentz, chief of staff for Points of Light, a   nonprofit that mobilizes volunteers globally and works with companies on their employee volunteering efforts. â€œIf youâ€™re willing to take the risk to pack up your family and leave your home country, you are a pretty amazing,   capable person,â€ she says. â€œSo instead of looking at refugees as a problem, we can flip the script and say, â€˜How do we tap into the amazing power and skills of these individuals?â€™ That really changes the narrative. â€ In Athens, groups are helping to turn former schools and hotels into overflow housing. Having a stable home base is critical because poor conditions in refugee camps are an issue. â€œIt was really difficult to visit some of the sites in Greece, because youâ€™d have thousands of people, with one latrine per thousand,â€   says. Technology for all, Beyond a safe and sanitary home, nutritious food and access to   are needed. â€œRefugees need to be connected with their family group,â€ Panagiotarea says. â€œAnd if, for example, you want to have an application for asylum, some information is provided through the internet. â€ As refugees look to integrate into their new home communities, Rentz points out opportunities for crowdsourcing technology and apps that can help teach language skills, educate children who arenâ€™t in school, post job alerts or facilitate simple human bonding. â€œItâ€™s about figuring out how we can help them through the transition as theyâ€™re building new homes and new lives,â€ she says. â€œEvery single person is like their own universe,â€ adds Kathy Hertz, who organized the DCRally4Refugees in August. â€œYou do the best you can, and you give everything you have to the person in front of you. â€ Corporations have a role in resolving the crisis as well. Last year, Points of Light and its affiliate Volunteer4Greece helped to enable the delivery of 1, 408 relief kits from the UPS Foundation to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Greece to distribute to families living in the refugee camps. On a larger level, UPS has contributed more than $3m to the crisis, transported more than 28 ocean containers of relief supplies and created the UPS Relief Link tracking system for the UNHCR to ensure fair supply delivery across locations. Laura Lane, UPSâ€™ president of global public affairs, spent time volunteering at a refugee camp in Berlin in March, and was moved by the impact that small gestures can make. â€œThe refugee crisis isnâ€™t a European, Middle Eastern, African or American issue,â€ she says. â€œIt is a human issue. â€ Lane emphasizes that to better respond to the crisis, governments and global businesses like UPS need to work    forming new partnerships and sharing information. Those partnerships, she suggests, are essential to helping both the refugees themselves and the countries absorbing the impact of the unprecedented flow of people.   still keeps tabs on the family of five she met in Berlin this year. The oldest son now attends a local school, can speak German and sometimes translates for his parents. The family has taken big strides in forging a new life. Stories like theirs will be common as serious conflicts persist in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. And dedicated groups and volunteers will still be needed to keep giving displaced people guidance, security and community support. â€œIn many ways, itâ€™s the jackpot for refugees to become resettled,â€   says. â€œBut at the same time, that also involves a tremendous amount of trauma in recognizing they probably will never be going back to their home. Making them feel like they have another landing pad or support system makes a huge difference. â€ This content is paid for by

politifact14384,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/fbi-agent-peter-strzok-will-testify-before-congress.html,"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress","The Republican partyâ€™s descent into civil war has revived Democratic hopes of an improbable treble by winning the presidency, House and Senate, allowing Hillary Clinton to pursue an aggressive agenda without the obstacles that have faced Barack Obama. With Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign at risk of imploding, there are growing signs that both parties are focusing on the battle for Congress, where Republicans have everything to lose and could find Trump dragging them underwater like a drowning man. Trumpâ€™s apparent declaration of war against the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Republican establishment on Tuesday will have done little to soothe nerves. Republican members of Congress seeking   now face the perilous choice of whether to risk alienating moderates or angering Trump diehards. Some are evidently trying to have their cake and eat it. The Senate consists of 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats and two independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats. The House breaks down as 246 Republicans and 186 Democrats with three vacancies. This year was always going to be an uphill battle for Republicans in hoping to retain the Senate. Democrats are defending just 10 seats while the GOP has to hold on to 24. Democrats also tend to do better in a presidential election year with higher turnout.  If Clinton wins the White House, Democrats need to take only four seats to gain control because the   has the casting vote in the event of a tie. But key Senate races, which include presidential battlegrounds such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, have remained competitive.  The House also seemed to be safe in Republican hands, due in significant part to the gerrymandering that has made districts more partisan. Despite Democratsâ€™ best efforts to cast their opponents as the â€œParty of Trumpâ€ few signs have pointed to the brash real estate mogul being as deadly to   candidates as they once feared. But last Fridayâ€™s release of an    video in which Trump boasted about sexual assault have again shaken the party to its core. As his poll numbers plunge, there are fears that independent and even some Republican voters will turn against the party, or at least stay at home on election day, potentially handing Democrats a crucial advantage. Suddenly the Senate looks in grave jeopardy and even the House could be in play again. Voters support Democrats over Republicans for Congress by seven percentage points, according to an NBC   Street Journal poll taken after the release of the tape but before Sunday nightâ€™s presidential debate. Democrats have been looking to tie candidates to Trump for some time and are now intensifying their efforts. One TV ad for a House seat in Wisconsin attacks Republican Mike Gallagher by playing the Trump video and stating: â€œMike Gallagher still says we have to support Donald Trump. No, we donâ€™t. We donâ€™t have to support Mike Gallagher either. â€ Among the most vulnerable incumbent Republican senators are Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Richard Burr in North Carolina, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Mark Kirk in Illinois, and Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania. Also facing tough   battles are senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain in Arizona, who have managed to run parallel races to Trump despite endorsing him.  In the wake of the lewd tape, Ayotte, Portman and McCain rescinded their support for Trump. So did Joe Heck, who is running for the open Senate seat in Nevada that is being vacated by the retiring minority leader, Harry Reid.  Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully against Trump in the Republican presidential primary, stuck by his former rival on Tuesday. â€œI have never hesitated to oppose his policies I disagree with. And I have consistently rejected his offensive rhetoric and behavior,â€ Rubio said in a statement that captured the awkward contortions of many Republicans. â€œI disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for president. But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next president. â€ Rubio has led his Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy in most polling of the Florida Senate race, the latest being a University of North Florida survey showing the senator up by seven points. But an NBC   Wall Street Journal poll also released this week showed Rubio with just a   advantage among likely voters, proving the contest is far from over.  Both polls were also conducted before the controversy over Trumpâ€™s tapes, which Murphy has sought to capitalize on. The congressman appeared with Hillary Clinton at a rally in Miami on Tuesday, paraphrasing Michelle Obamaâ€™s speech at the Democratic convention: â€œWhen Donald Trump goes low, Marco Rubio is right there with him. â€ Other Republican senators continued to walk a tightrope, uncertain whether to embrace Trump or denounce him and risk a backlash from his vociferous supporters. In Pennsylvania, Toomey trails Democratic rival Katie McGinty by one point, according to the Huffington Postâ€™s average of publicly available polling. Toomey has made sharp criticisms of Trump but not yet made clear whether he will vote for him.  The challenge of holding Trump at armâ€™s length, while acknowledging that victory may elude them without his enthusiastic army of supporters, was apparent as Republicans sought to mitigate the damage from his comments about women. Ryan was jeered at a rally in Wisconsin for criticizing Trump, while Heck and the former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney faced similar protests at a campaign event in Nevada.  â€œThey risk alienating the most loyal Trump supporters if they denounce him. And theyâ€™re still going to be criticised by Democrats for supporting him for months,â€ Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno, told USA Today. â€œI donâ€™t think you can walk back your support for Trump at this point and actually gain voters. The best you can hope for is you might limit the bleeding. â€ In the House, Democrats can target Republicans in 26 districts that Obama won four years ago. He came close in a further 23 districts. Some of the most vulnerable Republicans have denounced Trump in recent days. Barbara Comstock of northern Virginia has been a longtime critic of him but Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett has thrown Trump at her on the debate stage and in commercials. For now, the true   impact of Trumpâ€™s recent crash remains unclear. Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the   Cook Political Report, who has been closely tracking the races, said: â€œI understand why Democrats are optimistic but that optimism isnâ€™t based on any meaningful data yet. â€ Shaun Bowler, professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, had a similar assessment.  â€œIt isnâ€™t clear  â€”   or at least not from the data that are public yet  â€”   just how much damage Trump is doing to the GOP brand,â€ Bowler said. â€œYes, there are lots of hardliners sticking by him regardless  â€”   it just isnâ€™t clear though whether that support will translate into a win for candidates lower down the ballot. â€œIt seems likely that the wave after wave of attacks from fellow Republicans coupled with what seems to be generally regarded as Trumpâ€™s poorly run campaign will depress turnout among Republicans. Which means  â€”   for some candidates  â€”   there is a problem. On the one hand they can see the blowback Ryan is experiencing, suggesting there may be costs to bailing on Trump on the other Trumpâ€™s candidacy simply may depress the number of voters who turn out. This is a harder group to talk about since it does depend on    knowledge. â€ Whit Ayres, a veteran political consultant and pollster for Rubioâ€™s presidential campaign, agreed: â€œItâ€™s really too early to assess until weâ€™ve had time to get some polling data back. I did believe that Republicans have an excellent chance to hold on to the House and a   chance to retain the Senate, both of which are more optimistic than many peopleâ€™s view last summer. â€œThat said, we donâ€™t know the effect of the tape, the debate and Trumpâ€™s pledge to essentially take the party down with him. â€ In 1984, former   Walter Mondale was demolished by Ronald Reagan yet Democrats gained two Senate seats. In 1996, former Kansas senator Bob Dole lost to Bill Clinton by more than 8% but Republicans won two Senate seats.  â€œThereâ€™s nothing written in the stars that just because the top of the ticket goes down, the members have to lose their seats as well,â€ Ayres said. Ryanâ€™s priorities as the nationâ€™s top Republican, at least, are clear.  On Monday he told colleagues in a conference call he would no longer defend Trump, nor would he campaign with the nominee, and would instead concentrate on trying to hold on to the partyâ€™s majorities in the House and Senate. The goal, Ryan said, was to ensure Clinton did not get a â€œblank checkâ€ with a   Congress should she win.  Ryan received both support and criticism from House members, some of whom warned that it was the very strategy of ostracising Trump, rather than backing him, that could cost them the House. On Tuesday, Trump used Twitter to fire off attacks on Ryan. Disloyal Republicans â€œare far more difficultâ€ than Clinton, he posted. â€œThey come at you from all sides. They donâ€™t know how to win I will teach them!â€ Forty Republican senators and representatives have revoked their support for Trump, with nearly 30 of those calling on him to quit the race altogether, according to a count by the Associated Press. But Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, insists that the party stands by the nominee. There are also signs of a shift in emphasis in the Clinton campaign, aware that control over House and Senate would present her with a historic opportunity to enact a progressive agenda that includes issues such as gun control and climate change. Last year, Clinton accused the other Republican candidates of maligning Muslims after Trump proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country. â€œTheir language may be more veiled than Mr Trumpâ€™s, but their ideas arenâ€™t so different,â€ Clinton said during a December campaign event in New Hampshire.  â€œDonald Trump didnâ€™t come out of nowhere,â€ Clinton said during a March speech at the University of Wisconsin â€”  Madison. â€œWhat the Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics, they are now reaping with Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy. â€ By May, when it was clear Clinton would win the Democratic primary, her campaign took a different tack.  â€œThe campaign does not want to connect Trump and the Republican party. They want to make Trump look even more extreme than the    Republican Member of Congress,â€ an internal email exchange between officials at the Democratic National Committee, made public by WikiLeaks as part of a huge   revealed. The campaign spent much of the summer months casting Trump as far beyond the pale while touting endorsements from business leaders and influential Republicans.  But when the tape of Trump boasting about using his fame to prey on women was made public and the   tensions between factions of the Republican party erupted into a   civil war over the weekend, Clintonâ€™s campaign gleefully fanned the flames. â€œItâ€™s pretty stunning that right after the debate the speaker of the House has to come and say heâ€™s no longer going to defend Donald Trump and that each Republican member of Congress has to decide for themselves whether theyâ€™re going to support the nominee,â€ Clintonâ€™s campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters this week. â€œI understand why theyâ€™re doing that, but Paul Ryan and leaders of the Republican party  â€”   there was a time when they could have stopped Donald Trump. There was a time where they couldâ€™ve spoken out against him. That time was the summer and obviously itâ€™s too late now. â€ In a signal that the campaign was not abandoning its courtship of Republicans and independent voters, Palmieri noted that the campaign launched ads featuring Republican voters backing Clinton in key battleground states, including Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Iowa.  â€œDonald Trump didnâ€™t become the nominee of his party on his own. The leaders helped legitimise him and I think they have a lot to answer for, and I imagine voters will hold them accountable, too,â€ Palmieri continued, singling out the Senate races in Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republican incumbents McCain and Ayotte had withdrawn their endorsements of Trump. On Monday, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was forced to contend with his decision to disavow Trump.  â€œItâ€™s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of our party,â€ the Arizona senator said during a debate in Phoenix with his Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick. â€œHe won the nomination fair and square. But   â€¦     I have daughters. I have friends. I have so many wonderful people on my staff. They cannot be degraded and demeaned in that fashion. â€ Ian Prior, communications director of Republicansâ€™ Senate Leadership Fund, remained optimistic.  â€œFrom day one, Senate Republicans have been running their races focused on the particular issues that are important in their respective states,â€ he said. â€œBecause of that, they are well positioned to withstand any cross currents from the top of the ticket and, consequently, this gives Republicans a good chance at retaining the majority in the Senate. â€ But Obama, arguably still the most effective messenger for Democrats, twisted the knife while campaigning for Clinton on Tuesday.  â€œYou canâ€™t have it both ways here!â€ Obama told voters in North Carolina. â€œYou canâ€™t repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say, â€˜But Iâ€™m still gonna endorse â€™em to be the most powerful person on the planet!â€™ â€œThe fact that now youâ€™ve got people saying, â€˜Well, we strongly disapprove. We really disagree. We find those comments disgusting, but weâ€™re still endorsing him.

politifact14190,www.veterantv.com/trump-removing-marines-from-the-navy/,Trump Removing Marines From the Navy,"Like any   generational epithet, to be a millennial is not as simple as it sounds. If you read the news, you might be forgiven for thinking that weâ€™re a mass of    gay biracial angels whoâ€™d rather take a BuzzFeed quiz than think for ourselves  â€”   weâ€™re responsible for the death of the car industry, the cable industry, weâ€™re lazy, weâ€™re entrepreneurial, weâ€™re overly nostalgic and weâ€™re narcissistic. But however handy the descriptive term, the truth is that weâ€™re a widely various crowd. Just look at this election. Millennials are not lining up for Hillary Clinton, nor any candidate, for that matter. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that support for Hillary Clinton among voters ages   in a   race is a paltry 31%. Libertarian Gary Johnson finished second and secured 29%. For the olds of America, this is a scary prospect. A recent New York Times   by Charles M Blow claimed that young people voting for   candidates this election cycle, seen by many as a form of protest against the establishment options, is â€œincredibly problematic and potentially  â€. While that might be true, his piece illustrates a disagreement on how democracy should be structured and how demographics work. Iâ€™m not going to chastise anyone for rejecting the false binary of American politics. Claiming that someone is wasting their vote is undemocratic, even if the outcome is undesirable. In fact, it should be heartening that young people are even aware enough to know that there are more than two political parties in this country. But I do wonder how we got to this point after the utopian high of the 2008 election, when Shepard Fairey posters were hanging on college   walls and will. i. am was releasing inspirational, triumphalist music videos.  Eight years later, whatever people wanted from Barack Obama they didnâ€™t quite get, and Clinton is struggling to claim her potential presidency as an extension of his legacy. Besides Clintonâ€™s unique, complex issues with   â€œlikabilityâ€ thereâ€™s another reason millennials arenâ€™t lining up to to buy Iâ€™m With Her tote bags: traditional appeals to court our vote no longer work and weâ€™re losing patience with the political system of this country. I can still remember a time when youth brands felt the need to hawk dusty old concepts like â€œcivic responsibilityâ€ and â€œdemocracyâ€. Take, for instance, this dire MTV Rock the Vote commercial starring Madonna and two anonymous   dancers. Marvel at Madgeâ€™s lackadaisical attempt to drum up a modicum of tepid patriotism. â€œIf you donâ€™t vote, youâ€™re going to get a spanking,â€ she says while sporting nothing but a bit of red lingerie and an American flag.  In 2004, youth voting went up again, because of (or perhaps in spite of) Puff Daddyâ€™s insipid Vote or Die campaign. Vote or Die didnâ€™t literally mean that you would die if you didnâ€™t vote, though there was certainly the implication that you might get drafted and sent to Iraq if you didnâ€™t support Democratic candidate John Kerry. Puff Daddy has since been on record saying he thinks voting is a â€œscamâ€. Heâ€™s not alone. These days, youâ€™d be better off selling canned farts at a flea market than promoting the necessity of exercising the franchise in November. Despite its association with the grunge 90s  â€”   or maybe because of it  â€”   Rock the Vote still exists, even if the idea of â€œrockingâ€ is about as relevant to the youth vote as a rotary phone. This year, Rock the Vote is joining forces with Glamour magazine, Refinery29, Jezebel and the Cut to register at least 100, 000 women before the election, an initiative called #OurVoteCounts. As one would imagine with the strategic placement of the hashtag in the name, most of this registration drive will take place online, unlike the   campaigns of yesteryear. To better appeal to its newer, younger, sexier partners, Rock the Vote might want to also consider rebranding for the 21st century  â€”   maybe something like Electric Democracy Carnival? Organizers can hold voter registration drives in the desert, hand out glow sticks and pacifiers, and build a giant wooden statue of Thomas Jefferson that they can set on fire every evening. Still, itâ€™s good to see Rock The Vote make the jump from the airwaves to the internet. Youth political mobilization is occurring online, through organizing methods that are either independent of any sort of official PAC or are merely social networks of   individuals looking for a tightly sealed echo chamber. Donald Trump manages to stay in the news cycle some days purely by saying something hateful or stupid on Twitter  â€”   posing with a taco bowl, blaming Hillary Clinton for any negative headline, and often outright lying. Hillary Clintonâ€™s recent appearance on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis was a funny, though transparent, attempt to get â€œthe kidsâ€ to be â€œdownâ€ with her. The bogeyman of this election cycle is the   a movement that doesnâ€™t have a central figurehead  â€”   though Donald Trump is its pet project of the moment and both implicitly and explicitly promotes its agenda  â€”   but has frightened liberals enough that Hillary Clinton felt compelled to call the movement out in a stump speech.  While the   isnâ€™t engaging in     activities as of yet, supporters are making their voices heard through the favored persuasive tactics of my generation  â€”   social media harassment and florid think pieces (many of which appear on the Breitbart News website). Whereas Rock the Vote sought to infuse music rebellion into politics, the   seems to be hoping to inject politics into rebellion. When diversity and acceptance are buzzwords and mainstream pop culture is increasingly socially liberal, it stands to reason that anyone with a taste for anarchy and transgression would turn to the right. But both sides of the millennial political divide have come to distrust their elders, even if the candidates of the   fringe  â€”   Johnson, Trump, Stein, Sanders  â€”   are old enough to collect whatâ€™s left of social security. There is an increasing awareness in this country that somethingâ€™s gone wrong. Millennial dissatisfaction with the course that the United States is taking is growing. Earlier this year, the GenForward survey, a collaboration between the Black Youth Project and the Associated   Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago, discovered that 52% of millennials feel the country is â€œfalling behindâ€ and another 24% believe itâ€™s â€œfailingâ€. That same study found that 17% of black millennials arenâ€™t planning to vote, which could be a devastating blow for Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, as sheâ€™ll be relying on the youth and minority vote to overcome Trumpâ€™s significant advantage with white Americans. The apathy of the millennial voter might simply be a symptom of having two candidates in their late 60s or early 70s who donâ€™t have the air of hipness that Barack Obama employed. What pops a hole in that theory is that millennial voting rates fell 7% from 2008 to 2012. Instead, thereâ€™s the very real possibility that as millennials age, they are less apt to stomach a thing called hope. The Obama presidency did not usher in a new age of cooperation. Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner did not announce they would be going on a nationwide concert tour performing the hits of the Carpenters.  Racial tension, climate change, gun violence, terrorism, and poverty persist. Easy answers do not exist, and even if they did, they wouldnâ€™t be coming from one of the two major political parties  â€”   groups often more concerned with their own survival than practical solutions to tangible issues. As the global situation appears to become more and more hopeless  â€”   thanks to actual horrors, plus the media saturation that occurs after every tragedy, which amplifies our malaise  â€”   it should come as no surprise that millennials as a group and the nation at large disagree on how to turn things around. Consensus might just be a thing of the past MTV is far from the unchallenged thought leader for American youth. What this election might be remembered for is the moment when the American political system became so ossified and incapable of solutions that we decided, at last, to junk it and start from scratch.

Not to be just yet, for hanging upside down inside my mother with my head pressed against her pelvis while getting repeatedly battered by Claudeâ€™s cock thrusting inside her isnâ€™t what I call a meaningful existence. Itâ€™s enough to give a foetus a migraine. My mum is up to something. Iâ€™m sure of it. I can hear her plotting with Claude. As you may have guessed Claude is not my father. Iâ€™d recognise his cock anywhere. The shame of it. â€œO that this too unsolid flesh would melt. â€ Theyâ€™re drinking again. If Iâ€™m going to get another hangover then Iâ€™d prefer a Chateau Elsinore rather than a cheap Sancerre. Claude and Trudy do a lot of drinking. Too much Iâ€™d say. Sometimes I think she isnâ€™t the slightest bit bothered about me. Iâ€™ll give her a kick to remind her. â€œThe babyâ€™s kicking again,â€ says Trudy. â€œNot long now. Weâ€™ll soon be rid of it. â€ Thatâ€™s Claude. â€œSo hereâ€™s the plan. We invite my brother round for a drink and put some   in a smoothie. Once heâ€™s croaked Iâ€™ll get to keep the St Johnâ€™s Wood house and weâ€™ll be Â£7m to the good. â€ My brother! That means Claude must be my uncle. Thatâ€™s disgusting. God! What a piece of work is a man. And a woman for that matter. Iâ€™ve got to think of a way of putting an end to this. â€œIâ€™ll bide my time until vile Claude be pissed And passed out in Trudyâ€™s incestuous bed. â€ Let me tell you a bit about my dad. Heâ€™s called John. Yeah, I know you thought he was going to be called Ham but weâ€™ve all had a few nasty surprises lately. So John writes and publishes poetry which basically means heâ€™s broke. Apart from the St Johnâ€™s Wood house which he inherited. And is now about to lose, along with his life if Iâ€™ve heard correctly. I really ought to do something about it. â€œIf I were man enough, Iâ€™d take revenge. Though pâ€™raps tis best to give myself a break For I still lack sufficient evidence. â€ The place is a dump. Trudyâ€™s a complete slob. I donâ€™t want to blame her too much as sheâ€™s only 28. She got married far too young and isnâ€™t ready to settle down. Still, I do think she could make a bit of an effort for my arrival. She could get the Norwegian cleaners in. Thereâ€™s a ring on the doorbell. Itâ€™s my father with another woman. â€œHi Trudy,â€ he says. â€œThis is Elodie. Sheâ€™s a poet and weâ€™re planning to get married. Donâ€™t come over all surprised. Iâ€™ve known about you and Claude for a while. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be very happy together. So hereâ€™s the deal. Youâ€™ve got a month to get out of the house. Iâ€™ll be over tomorrow to sort out the details. â€ What? My fatherâ€™s got a girlfriend? Iâ€™m pretty sure that was never in the script. Everyoneâ€™s started to ad lib badly here. Nor did he even mention what was going to happen to me. Neither of them seem to want me. No wonder Iâ€™m having an existential crisis before Iâ€™m even born. â€œOr could it be that I oâ€™er think my life And take my torment far too personally From too much thought doth little action come Thus conscience makes cowards of us all. So man up, foetus, get thyself stuck in Remember this: I think, therefore I am. â€ To cut a short story shorter. Claude and Trudy fucked and got pissed, before Claude went off to mix up the  . The next day John came round and Iâ€™m moving and kicking as best I can to make Trudy think twice about offing him. No joy, Claude sneaks up and tips the poison in his ear. Just kidding. I shout â€˜Donâ€™t drink itâ€™ but no one hears. Next thing I know thereâ€™s a news item saying heâ€™s been found dead on the M1. How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world! The police have come round. They havenâ€™t arrested them yet but they donâ€™t seem to be buying the suicide story. Canâ€™t say I blame them. Theyâ€™re getting pissed and fucking again. Iâ€™ve got a headache and bruises all over me. Iâ€™ve had enough, Iâ€™m going to hang myself with the umbilical cord. â€œAnd when I die, make sure the whole world knows I was a decent bloke for the most part. â€ I couldnâ€™t go through with it. Claude and Trudy are planning to do a runner. Theyâ€™re going to dump me. God, I donâ€™t want to be alone in exile in Poland. I must do something. â€œGet off thy butt, foetus! From this time forth My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth. â€ â€œOh my God,â€ yells Trudy. â€œIâ€™m giving birth. â€ I just need to hang on till the police arrive. The rest is silence.

Yet if there is one mistake EU leaders should avoid now, it would be to think that the forces at play represent a strictly British phenomenon. Twin dynamics have been brutally exposed: the breakdown of the link connecting British voters to elites and institutions  â€”   who all argued for remain  â€”   and the rapidly fading connection between citizens across the continent and EU institutions. Itâ€™s true that Britain is a special case in Europe. It joined belatedly, and purely for economic reasons. It has had all sorts of  . For years it fought for and won special statusfor a specific status and it got it in diverse ways. This was a product of Europeâ€™s past  â€”   not just of British identity or domestic politics, or even the media environment. Unlike postwar France and Germany, Britain  â€”   as Jean Monnet, the father of the EU, acknowledged in his memoirs  â€”   â€œfelt no need to exorcise historyâ€. But this vote is not one that affects Britain alone, and for which just one country will bear the consequences. It puts the cohesion and strength of western liberal democracies at stake in a global environment plagued with uncertainties. Picking up the pieces of this wreckage will require   decisions and a new approach across Europe. Whether that will happen is now the big uncertainty. The first thing to avoid is going into denial about the magnitude of what has happened. Now populist,   and   forces will push forward in the belief that a precedent has been set for other â€œexitsâ€. Look at the statements from Marine Le Pen, the head of Franceâ€™s Front National, and the Dutch   leader Geert Wilders  â€”   and the messaging from the Kremlinâ€™s propaganda machine. The very survival of the EU is now in peril, and not just because a country representing its second largest economy and a key pillar of its security is set to withdraw. Surely, that much is clear to all. Yet some reactions are already baffling. Angela Merkel has solemnly called for calm. FranÃ§ois Hollande has declared that there needs to be a â€œrefoundationâ€ of the EU. Donald Tusk, European council president, quotes Nietzsche: â€œWhat doesnâ€™t kill you makes you stronger. â€ Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, believes â€œthe chain reaction being celebrated everywhere now by Eurosceptics wonâ€™t happenâ€. Stand by for more such delusional talk in the days and weeks to come. Most will betray the angst of damage limitation rather than a recognition that one era has ended and the new is not yet born. But if there is one lesson, it is that the usual rituals of the EU simply wonâ€™t do. Diplomatic choreography wonâ€™t be enough to restore what has been shattered, and what the Brexit vote has starkly reflected: there is no longer confidence among European citizens that a collective endeavour of solidarity and values can deliver what they need and want. The confidence of the lower and middle classes is now closer to zero than it ever has been. Remember recent surveys: only 38% of the French view the EU positively today (the same poll said it was 44% of the British). The French historian Fernand Braudel once wrote that â€œhistory can be divided into three movements: that which moves rapidly, moves slowly and appears not to move at allâ€. History is now accelerating right before our eyes. It is moving swiftly in a bad direction, and for those who, as I did, witnessed the spread of democracy and the reunification of the continent that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, or who were brought up to think that Europeâ€™s future lay in the coming together of its disparate parts, it is an ominous and painful moment. The British divorce will be messy and drawn out. It will divert energy needed to address other challenges like security, unemployment, migration, and the geopolitical chaos in the EUâ€™s neighbouring regions. It could make it even harder to address the gap that increasingly divides the political elites from the public mood across the continent.   politicians are in denial if they think more European integration slogans are the solution. Citizens simply wonâ€™t buy it. For more than 10 years now,   referendums have been a disaster. The   European constitution project was rejected in 2005, and this year the Netherlands voted against an EU association agreement with Ukraine. Hungary is due to hold a referendum on EU refugee quotas. Expect a no. If something can be salvaged, the EU needs to rebuild itself from the ground up, not top down. It is a folly to think measures to fix eurozone governance will suffice, however needed those may be. Anyone who has regularly travelled across Europe in recent years and sounded out grassroots perceptions knows that something else is lacking: a sense of purpose, a belief that Europe stands for something positive and that it can act in peopleâ€™s interest. The European project was built by a small group of visionary politicians in the 1950s who believed that citizens would over time see its positive impact on their lives. For a long time thatâ€™s what happened. And many young people, including in the UK, do grasp the advantages. But for many reasons that link is in danger, and if it is further weakened Europe will unravel. This is the one priority that should obsess those who sit in Brussels and people everywhere who care about preserving fundamental values. If trust and hope are not restored in the notion that the EU can be democratic in its functioning and deliver concrete outcomes to citizens, the Pied Pipers of populism will continue to attract confused electorates. More illiberalism and toxic divisions will seep into the continent. This vote is a   call: Europe needs saving.",403,975,"859504242167513089	859547851206144003	859550400797716480	859552656406216704	859561512087822336	859563216430653440	859567680927391745	859572465168764929	859594814345674752	859597578505039872	859599596900700160	859608135048343552	859611225616900096	859613256624865281	859613514880606208	859615365718044672	859616364641865731	859699144054550529	859703368549380096	859759173554376705	859794626965884928	859798061165367296	859834974173835264	859836227851362308	859876527621668864	859912724201050112	859921706529550337	859957800528736256	859971206216331264	860000018022969344	860023778910142464	860029373667307552	860031993244987392	860041035623407617	860130191066247171	860149557128253441	860171584815890432	860267457495400450	860291847473594368	860472455470620673	860488746096926720	860631830583586816	860771451212668930	860823330907197440	860880446435053571	860945803803635712	860985125927911424	860985315434962944	861236632661495808	861598441977257984	861706366729236484	861971159159537666	863203124298887168	863244316625567745	863354136649183232	866704719632228352	866704758014263297	866704762493837312	866704767120101377	866704783297527808	866704781502435328	866704797793083393	866704803841228800	866707041536147457	866707270486433792	866707575546552320	866725890239062016	866758726350458880	866760699719987200	866769341487828992	866776701178716161	866867985759305729	866883061668958208	867046455755886593	868286577730097152	869607007585751040	873188422638333952	887912934986452992	947607603655467008	991707147472920576	991733684771393536",fake

Government statisticians reported the change in rankings on Friday, drawing from a review of 15 years of death certificates.  â€œI think most people, when they think of childhood cancer, think of leukemia,â€ said Sally Curtin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. â€œThis is kind of a changing of the guard. â€  Cancer is the fourth leading cause of death for children overall, accounting for about 1 in 10 childhood deaths in 2014. About a quarter these cancer deaths, or 534, were due to brain cancer. There were 445 leukemia deaths. Accidental injuries remained the leading cause of death for those under 19, followed by suicide and murder, according to the report.  There are still more new cases of leukemia each year than new cases of brain cancer, but it no longer accounts for the most deaths. Thatâ€™s due to advances in leukemia treatment over the past few decades and because leukemia is easier than brain cancer to treat, experts said.  â€œSome types of leukemia that a generation ago were almost universally fatal are now almost universally treatable,â€ said Curtin, a statistician who worked on the report.  But the rate of death from brain cancer for children has held at about the same level for at least 15 years, according to the CDC report.  The trends are similar for adults too, according to the American Cancer Society.  Leukemia is a type cancer that affects the blood. That makes it easier for doctors to get to it and fight it with treatments like chemotherapy.  The brain is protected by a barrier which helps keeps many dangerous chemicals  â€”   including many cancer drugs  â€”   from getting to brain tissue or brain tumors. Surgery is difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on where the tumor is located in the brain. Radiation treatment can damage the development of a childâ€™s brain.  â€œThereâ€™s survival, and then thereâ€™s survival at a price,â€ said Dr Katherine Warren, an expert in pediatric brain tumor research at the National Cancer Institute.  Another factor is that scientists have only recently begun to understand that pediatric brain cancers may be biologically different from adult versions, and could require different approaches to treatment.  In 2014, the brain cancer death rate was about 0. 7 per 100, 000 children ages 1 through 19. The leukemia death rate was about 0. 6. The overall pediatric cancer death rate dropped by about a fifth between 1999 and 2014, the CDC reported, helped by the reduction in leukemia deaths.

Up to 300 people were also reported to have been injured in the strikes on Monday morning around 130 miles west of the city of Palmyra, which was retaken from Syrian forces by the Islamic State group. Witnesses to the attacks say that none of those who died had blast injuries. â€œMost of the dead were families,â€ said Ahmad al Hamawi, head of a regional council. â€œThey had built primitive shelters and they ran to them, not knowing it was poison gas. While they were in the shelters the gas entered because of the wind direction, and killed dozens, mostly women and children. â€ The high death toll is not consistent with the spate of chlorine gas attacks across Syria in recent years, which have killed scores of people in total but have not caused mass casualties at this scale. Photographs purportedly taken after the attacks show rows of children lying on the ground. All appear to be dead and foam is apparent near the nose of one young boy.  The images resemble those taken in the aftermath of an attack that killed more than 1, 300 people in the suburbs of Damascus in August 2013, which the United Nations said was â€˜indisputablyâ€™ caused by sarin gas. On that occasion the US, UK and France blamed the Assad regime. The UN said the sarin used had probably come from regime stockpiles. After the attacks, Syria signed up to the convention for the prevention of chemical weapons and surrendered its stockpile of sarin under international supervision. Weapons experts and western governments have since alleged that officials hid some sarin from inspectors. The OPCW claims it has accounted for 94% of Syriaâ€™s sarin stockpiles.  The villages hit on Monday are held by Isis in the far east of Hama province, where up to 40 small communities remain under their sway. They mark the furthest point of Isis influence from the groupâ€™s stronghold in eastern Syria. Isis forces did not storm Palmyra from the area, travelling instead across open desert from Raqqa. However, the five villages, which are little more than farming hamlets, are the closest area of Isis influence to the famed archeological site, the loss of which for a second time has stung the regime of Bashar  . Al Hamawi said that one village, Jrouh, had been targeted with two rockets, which killed 35 and wounded up to 200. A second attack in nearby Salaliyah killed 46 people. A third attack in Hammadi Omar, about 4 miles (6km) away, sent victims fleeing to a rudimentary   clinic.  â€œIt doesnâ€™t have a single doctor the only people who were there were paramedics. They were treated with primitive methods like giving them unpasteurised milk to make them vomit as well as washing them with water and removing their clothes,â€ said al Hamawi.  â€œThe symptoms they had were foaming from the mouth, sometimes with blood, reddening of the eyes, convulsions and hysteria. People were in terror because there were dead on the streets. â€ Ahmad al Dbis, the regional hospitals and trauma director at the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations (UOSSM) said medical volunteers had contacted the organisation looking for treatment advice. â€œThe missiles used had a small effect radius, so they didnâ€™t have the same destructive power as the missiles usually used. â€œThe attack also happened during the time when schoolchildren in the area go to their schools, so more than 20 children in Jrouh were suffocating and a large number of them died. â€ Medical staff said victimsâ€™ symptoms were suffocation, hysteria, vomiting, involuntary urination, foaming at the mouth, sometimes with blood, heavy coughing, red eyes and constricted irises. Death is said to have occurred quite quickly after victims breathed the gas. Medics on the ground claimed the gas had no colour or smell, and was distinct from the smell of chlorine. â€œThere were also no oxygen generators or tanks. So those who inhaled a lot of the gas died immediately and those who had breathed in a smaller amount were placed in an open air environment and they slightly improved, but there are still some critical cases,â€ said al Dbis.

politifact14737,http://freeinfomedia.com/breaking-supreme-court-issues-first-bench-warrant-ever/,BREAKING: Supreme Court Issues Its First Bench Warrant Ever,"Brock Turner, the American college athlete whose sexual assault case sparked international debates about campus violence, was released from jail on Friday after serving half of a   sentence, prompting protests by victimsâ€™ advocates and womenâ€™s rights groups. The    former Stanford University swimmer drew national notoriety after he was convicted of multiple felonies for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a fraternity house on the elite campus in California. Rape survivors and activists gathered outside a local courthouse in San Jose on Friday to criticize the short sentence as an insult to victims and to call for the removal of the judge who chose not to send Turner to state prison. â€œThis kind of unfair and unreasonable and unjustifiable sentencing is not going to be tolerated any longer,â€ said Jacqueline Lin, a    student who says she was sexually assaulted while at Stanford. Turner, who was released early for good behavior, which is standard in California, did not comment as he rushed past a mob of news cameras and entered a car waiting for him. On the night of 18 January 2015, two Swedish graduate students were biking by Stanfordâ€™s Kappa Alpha fraternity when they saw a man â€œthrustingâ€ on top of a motionless woman next to a dumpster. The bystanders intervened and held Turner until police arrived and found the woman, then 22 years old, â€œcompletely unresponsiveâ€ and partially clothed. In an unusual outcome for sexual assaults that occur on American college campuses, prosecutors filed criminal charges, and more than a year after the attack, a jury found Turner guilty of assault with intent to rape and sexually penetrating an intoxicated and unconscious person. The Ohio native faced a maximum of 14 years in prison, and state statute prescribed a minimum of two years for his convictions. But California law allowed the judge, Aaron Persky, to make an exception if he deemed the case to be â€œunusualâ€ and he ultimately ordered a   county jail term for Turner on 2 June. Persky, who is also a former Stanford athlete, expressed sympathy for Turner, telling a crowded courtroom in Palo Alto that he had already suffered from the media attention and that there was â€œless moral culpabilityâ€ because he was drunk at the time. The survivor anonymously released a powerful   statement, offering a graphic and disturbing account of the assault and the aftermath of a lengthy trial. â€œThe fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class,â€ she wrote. The victimâ€™s words rapidly spread online and made Turner and Persky globally reviled figures overnight. Outrage swelled after news broke that Turnerâ€™s father had called the attack â€œ20 minutes of actionâ€ and that Turner had continued to claim that alcohol was to blame and that the encounter was consensual. Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor and family friend of the victim, launched a formal campaign to recall Persky, and the judgeâ€™s past and ongoing cases have since faced intense scrutiny. In the wake of repeated accusations that he has failed to treat violence against women seriously, Persky recently removed himself from criminal court, transferring to civil cases. The case inspired new state legislation mandating prison for those found guilty of sexually assaulting unconscious victims, and survivors across the country have come forward to share similar accounts of trauma. The recall campaign leaders and protesters, who carried signs saying â€œProtect survivors not rapistsâ€ and â€œHold Persky accountableâ€ said they would continue the fight until the judge was removed from the bench entirely. In her speech, Dauber, chair of the recall effort, called on the state attorney general to investigate Persky for his actions in another case in which he delayed sentencing of a young domestic violence offender so he could play football in Hawaii. Kamilah Willingham,   of Survivors Eradicating Rape Culture, said the short jail sentence for Turner had galvanized many survivors and their allies.  â€œThere is now a national and international movement based on his lack of accountability,â€ said the    activist, who was featured in The Hunting Ground documentary, telling her story of assault while at Harvard law school. Persky is a part of the problem, she added. â€œIf judges valued survivors more, maybe the Brock Turners of the world would as well. â€  Persky, who has not responded to repeated requests for comment, recently launched a campaign to fight the recall, arguing that he is a strong advocate for â€œjudicial independenceâ€ and that he has a â€œreputation for being fair to both sidesâ€. Stephanie Pham,   of the Stanford Association of Students for Sexual Assault Prevention, said that more survivors are refusing to be silent and that she hopes their voices will help society recognize the seriousness of assault.  â€œRape isnâ€™t some regrettable act. Rape is a crime,â€ she said. â€œAnd the fact that that mentality is changing in some way right now is great, but itâ€™s obviously not enough. â€  Cianne Anthony, a    student, brought a sign that read â€œHow would you feel if it were your mother? Your sister? Would 3 months be enough?â€ â€œAfter reading the survivorâ€™s letter, I was completely torn up and felt I had to help in some way,â€ she said. â€œI hope people see the negative affects of   and leniency. â€  Tim Lennon, 69, said he was a survivor of sexual assault and that harsher punishments were a critical step to prevent further rapes.  â€œIf institutions like the Catholic church or the university continue to gloss over and ignore and dismiss sexual assault, weâ€™re never going to solve sexual assault. â€  Lennon, who works with the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, added, â€œThereâ€™s an element of racism here. If this had been a black man   â€¦     would he have gotten three months? Itâ€™s outrageous. â€  Jessica Williams, a    teaching assistant who carried a small sign that said â€œDONâ€™T RAPEâ€ said she was sick of hearing about what victims were wearing or drinking and wanted to see more education focused on consent and accountability of perpetrators.  â€œNobody is sending the message that you shouldnâ€™t rape,â€ she said. â€œThese types of crimes should be taken a lot more seriously than they were by Judge Persky. â€ ",418,402,"927570881433559040	927578435354054656	927581749403516928	927587208118317056	927590680842657793	927606175184678912	927634833622347781	927675663158579200	927683419387068416	927703371850571776	928997875186626561	929371172143280128",fake
politifact14095,https://usawatchdog.com/clinton-foundation-largest-unprosecuted-charity-fraud-in-history-charles-ortel/,Clinton Foundation Largest Unprosecuted Charity Fraud in History-Charles Ortel," Piers Sellers, a climate scientist and former astronaut who gained fame late in life for his eloquent commentary about the earthâ€™s fragility and his own cancer diagnosis, has died. He was 61.   Sellers, who flew on three space shuttle missions between 2002 and 2010, died on Friday morning in Houston, Texas, of pancreatic cancer, Nasa said in a statement. Sellers shared his astronautâ€™s perspective on climate change in Leonardo DiCaprioâ€™s documentary, Before the Flood, released earlier this year. He told DiCaprio that seeing the earthâ€™s atmosphere as a â€œtiny little onion skinâ€ from space helped him gain a fuller understanding of the planetâ€™s delicacy. He also wrote a New York Times   about grappling with the meaning of his lifeâ€™s work after learning he had terminal cancer. In both the film and the   he was optimistic, arguing that he expected human ingenuity to rescue the planet from a dire future of runaway global warming. The Nasa administrator, Charles Bolden, described Sellers â€œa tremendous public servant who was dedicated to Nasa, the nation and the worldâ€. â€œPiers was dedicated to all facets of exploration,â€ Bolden said. â€œHis curiosity and drive to uncover new knowledge was generously shared with audiences around the world, both from space and in wide travels to reach as many people as possible with an essential understanding of our fragile planet. â€œHis legacy will be one not only of urgency that the climate is warming, but also of hope that we can yet improve humanityâ€™s stewardship of this planet. His cancer diagnosis became a catalyst for him to work even harder on efforts to save the planet from global warming for the benefit of future generations. â€ Bolden said Sellers â€œwas a strident defender and eloquent spokesperson for our home planet, Earthâ€.  â€œSpacewalker and scientist, free thinker and friend to our planet, and all who seek new knowledge  â€”   to say he will be missed would be a gross understatement,â€ he said. Originally from Crowborough in East Sussex, the University of Leeds and Edinburgh graduate gained American citizenship to fulfil a childhood dream of flying into space. â€œWhen I was a kid, I watched the Apollo launches from across the ocean, and I thought Nasa was the holy mountain,â€ Sellers said earlier this year when Bolden presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal, the agencyâ€™s highest honour. â€œAs soon as I could, I came over here to see if I could climb that mountain. â€ Sellers was deputy director for sciences and exploration at Nasaâ€™s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He started working for Nasa as a scientist in 1982 and joined its astronaut corps in 1996. He logged 35 days in space during the three shuttle missions to the International Space Station and was appointed an OBE in the New Yearâ€™s Honours List in 2011.  â€œAs an astronaut, I spacewalked 220 miles [354km] above the Earth,â€ Sellers wrote in his  . â€œFloating alongside the International Space Station, I watched hurricanes cartwheel across oceans, the Amazon snake its way to the sea through a brilliant green carpet of forest, and gigantic   thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles along the equator. â€œFrom this Godâ€™  view, I saw how fragile and infinitely precious the Earth is. Iâ€™m hopeful for its future. â€ Sellers wrote that the best way he could imagine spending his final months was to continue working, despite knowing he would not live to see the worst of climate change or the harnessing of possible solutions. â€œNew technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate,â€ Sellers wrote. â€œThere is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. â€ Associated Press and Press Association contributed to this

politifact15584,https://gellerreport.com/2018/07/facebook-declaration-independence-hate-speech.html/,You are being redirected...,"The question that had dominated the Tour since the summit of the Peyresourde on 9 July was whether Nairo Quintana would be capable of taking the fight to Chris Froome once the race reached the Alps and on the evidence of the first of this weekâ€™s four Alpine stages, the Colombian will not be up to the task. Last yearâ€™s   was unable even to hold the pace of Froomeâ€™s closest rivals in the final kilometre after the race leader and his former   Richie Porte had flown the nest and, while his loss of 28 seconds may not prove conclusive, the trend is in one direction only. This finish was never expected to be definitive but the portents are ominous for Froomeâ€™s rivals as the race leader chipped away more time, finishing with Porte ahead of Adam Yates  â€”   who remains third overall at 2min 53sec  â€”   Fabio Aru and Romain Bardet, with Quintana limiting his losses but looking utterly spent. There were bigger losers: most notably the Dutchman Bauke Mollema, who slipped back inside the final two kilometres but retained second place, 2min 27sec behind Froome, while Alejandro Valverde cracked 4. 5km from the line and dropped from fifth to seventh overall. Froome said: â€œQuintana tried but perhaps he didnâ€™t have the legs. Richie was very strong today. It wasnâ€™t easy today, the first phase was flat out. Itâ€™s never easy but Iâ€™m feeling better than in any third week of a Grand Tour before. â€ He expects Quintana and Porte to be the danger men in Thursdayâ€™s mountain time trial the latter looks set to move up towards the podium but citing the Colombian as a threat seems a mere courtesy. Up above this remote spot only a few kilometres inside the Swiss border, Mont Blanc was unseasonably white, with snow warnings still in place for footpaths, in spite of the fact the Tour again baked in searing temperatures. Porte looked the coolest of Froomeâ€™s opponents and the 1min 45sec he lost in the stage finish at Cherbourg could cost him dear. The Australianâ€™s attack with two kilometres to go prompted a response from Quintana but Wout Poels was put to work on Froomeâ€™s behalf, with his effort enough to dislodge Mollema, which in turn prompted Froome to accelerate. Quintana hung on before cracking 400m from the line as Aru, Yates and Bardet wisely kept at their own pace. Froome and the little circle of contenders for the top 10  â€”   it is stretching reality to promote them as more than nominal threats for the overall title  â€”   fought out their own battle, initiated by Irelandâ€™s Daniel Martin, but won convincingly by Froome. A few minutes earlier the stage victory had been contested by two of the trio who dominated the final phase of Sundayâ€™s stage through the Jura to Culoz, with Ilnur Zakarin of Russia taking the stage from Jarlinson Pantano of Colombia. The Russian eluded Pantano and the king of the mountains Rafal Majka at 7. 5km to go, with the Colombian chasing to no avail. Zakarin struggled horribly in the final kilometre, to the extent that when he tried to take his hands off the handlebars to do up the zip of his jersey to display his sponsorâ€™s name, he wobbled and nearly fell off. By then he had all but sealed a timely win for the Katyusha team but inevitably, given the state of Russian sport, the      from Tatarstan, the world junior time trial champion in 2007, has a doping history. He tested positive for the steroid methandienone in 2009 and served a   suspension, although he insists it was merely a youthful peccadillo, that he was misled and has seen the error of his ways. He came to prominence last year when he won the Tour of Romandie ahead of Froome and added a stage win on a   day in the Giro dâ€™Italia. This year, he showed strongly in Romandie, where he held on to Quintana on the second stage but was disqualified from the win for misbehaving in the sprint. He was unlucky to crash out of the Giro when fifth overall. With 13 teams still to win a stage, the battle to get into the escape that would decide the stage finish was intense, which in turn led to 51km being covered in the first hour southwards out of Berne. A group of 11 riders emerged, joined by a further eight, including the points leader Peter Sagan, who has a practice of getting in mountain escapes, snaffling the intermediate sprint points and then   into the finish. Together with Sagan were past stage winners Majka and the Culoz winner, Pantano, plus Zakarin, who had felt he was robbed of the Culoz victory by a mislaid contact lens. By the foot of the final double ascents  â€”   30km of climbing split into two by an 8km downhill  â€”   they had a 12min lead, and one of their number was assured of the stage win. Both the front peloton and the main group stretched and split as soon as it reached the first slopes of the first category, Col de Forclaz, a relatively wide road cutting across a steep hillside between   vineyards above the town of Martigny. The sight was a familiar one: Team Skyâ€™s domestiques on the front, the rest lined out behind. The Forclaz was followed by a brief descent and then, at the point where the road into France went straight ahead, a right turn on to the finish climb, 10. 4km long, at an average gradient of around one in 11. This finish among a complex of three hydroelectric dams close to 2, 000m above sea level on the   border was a vast logistical experiment. The large team buses could barely get up the   mountain road on the final climb, while the podium was sat precariously between a rockface and an abyss with the reservoir at its foot. There was barely space for 50 people to watch the jerseys being awarded. The Tourâ€™s massive publicity caravan was not permitted to drive up to the finish, making this a curiously muted occasion. The action on Thursday shifts down the valley past Chamonix to the 17km climb through the town of Combloux to the ski resort of MegÃ¨ve for the Tourâ€™s first mountain time trial since 2013, when Froome won a longer stage in the south of the Alps. There is a flat   to the initial steep ascent, which then drags upwards before what should be a breathtaking 2. 5km sprint down to the line. The start is in Sallanches, a small commune with 16, 000 residents near the Mont Blanc massif and with immense resonance for French cycling fans as this was the site of Bernard Hinaultâ€™s victory in the world road race championship in 1980. This was one of the Badgerâ€™s most emphatic wins, forged on the slopes of the Domancy hill, which features in the course. This nod to what now seems a golden era underlines that this has been a poor Tour for the French, still without a stage win and with only Bardet in the top 10 overall  â€”   and five days to reverse that trend. 1 Ilnur Zakarin (Katusha) 4:36:33 2 Jarlinson Pantano (IAM Cycling) +55 3 Rafal Majka (Tinkoff) +1:26 4.

Even by those standards, however, you have to admire how his campaignâ€™s latest effort on the enduring   of Barack Obamaâ€™s birthplace ascends to its point: â€œIn 2011, Mr Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,â€ this hallucinates. â€œMr Trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Inarguably, Donald J Trump is a closer. â€ Always. Be. Closing. Still: was that an argument, or a performance of Glengarry Glen Dross? By any relevant yardstick, it doesnâ€™t matter. Like the 90s or herpes simplex, birtherism is back, if it ever even went out of fashion. What did go out of style, as is remarked upon several thousand times daily, is truth in politics. Is it terminal? Will truth in politics ever come back into fashion? Its influence has certainly contracted at such a rate that it seems reasonable to imagine the imminent establishment of the Spherical Earth Society. Membership of the Flat Earth Society  â€”   which maintained that the Earth was not a globe, despite absolutely overwhelming evidence to the contrary  â€”   is said to have peaked in the   at about 3, 500. At the current pace of decline, there is every chance that the Spherical Earth Society could hope for similar numbers by 2025. We must picture these last few pitied or ridiculed souls as a community who stubbornly trade political statistics and facts, despite the absolutely overwhelming evidence that such things are of sublime irrelevance in the modern era. As someone who still covets the wisdom of age, and always hopes to belatedly acquire the wisdom having banked the age (I am 42) I have not enjoyed watching so many of the righteous public figures I have long admired fail to make any headway in pushing back against Trumpâ€™s   world. They seem so   â€¦     impotent. Donâ€™t get me wrong  â€”   it doesnâ€™t mean their immense experience is a joke or that theyâ€™re wrong or misguided to try. Far from it. That an American psycho stands but one remove from the White House is as deadly serious as it gets, and those opposed to Trumpâ€™s hideous and historically ominous ideology must do everything they can to stop him. I do not mean to sound defeatist. But I am constantly staggered at how staggeringly ineffectual those who were once the best and the brightest are in the face of   posturing. I wish it were otherwise, but there is something very dating about the mere act of engaging with Trumpâ€™s lies, like watching a respected comedian misfire with an    bit about Snapchat. To watch a pundit even begin to pick apart that birther   is to watch a human being age 10 years on screen in the time it takes to get to â€œDonald J Trump is a closerâ€. You might as well have a Socratic debate with a fart. A decade or so ago, I remember reading a statistic about how pretty much everyone under a certain   age instinctively rang doorbells with their thumb  â€”   raised on games consoles and mobile phones and whatnot  â€”   while pretty much everyone over the age still used an index finger. I detect something of that quaint chasm now when I watch even political idols rebutting Trump. The brilliant David Simon, creator of The Wire, on Thursday seemed to be agreeing with the author Jeff Pearlman that the downsizing of journalism was responsible for â€œterribleâ€ coverage of the election. â€œYou can hire    to write,â€ Pearlman lamented, â€œbut can they report?â€ â€œOr think about what they are reporting or not reporting,â€ added Simon, â€œand why. â€ I know what they mean. But with the greatest of respect to these viewpoints, I canâ€™t help feeling that a good portion of our best hope for countering Trumpvision lies in the hands of that younger (to me) generation, who reflexively seem to understand what in the name of insanity is happening now far better than their elders, and increasingly seem more likely to find a way of countering it. Youth isnâ€™t always wasted on the young, and even the most   old hands must concede that Trump has almost all of them looking flatfooted. Please think fondly of that exchange in the Simpsons, where a hack says to Bart after some impudence: â€œIâ€™m an investigative reporter whoâ€™s on the road a lot, and uh, I must say that in my day, we didnâ€™t talk to our elders like that. â€ â€œWell,â€ replies Bart, â€œthis is my day, and we do. â€ Perhaps truth in politics will have some of its status restored in the event of a Hillary Clinton win. Perhaps truth in politics will return ironically, like dad jeans or Rick Astley. Whether truth will ever be the market leader again, however, seems less certain with every hour of this mesmerically modern US presidential campaign (just as it did, in a smaller and even more   kinda way, during the Brexit referendum). Then again, perhaps anxiety about the absence of truth is far older than we neophytes care to imagine, there being precisely nothing new under the sun. â€œIf truth be not fled with Astraea,â€ remarked Jonathan Swift all the way back in 1711, â€œshe is certainly as hidden as the source of the Nile itself, and can be found only in Utopia. â€ Perhaps she can once again be found in the

politifact14818,thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration,FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot before Obama administration approved controversial nuclear deal with Moscow,"The wildfire that raged through northern Alberta and forced the frantic evacuation of more than 90, 000 people was probably caused by humans, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Tuesday. After more than six weeks of investigation, police have determined the fire did not start naturally. â€œWildfire investigators for the province of Alberta have established that the fire was most likely the result of human activity, having ruled out lightning as a probable cause,â€ the RCMP said in a statement.  Investigators are now exploring whether the cause is linked to any sort of criminal offence. The fire was sparked on 1 May near a wilderness area popular with outdoor enthusiasts and police are asking anyone who was there in the days before the fire to come forward. Potential causes linked to humans, said Travis Fairweather of Alberta Wildfire, include campfires left unattended, debris caught in recreational vehicles and downed power lines. â€œWeâ€™re not ruling out any possibilities. â€  He said it was too early to speculate on the consequences that could emerge after the investigation. â€œWithin the Forest Protection Act you can be held accountable for the cost of putting out a wildfire, which, with a wildfire of this magnitude, could be a very high cost,â€ he said. â€œBut thatâ€™s not an avenue they go down unless they think it was some real negligence on that personâ€™s part. â€ Authorities are also investigating what he described as â€œincendiaryâ€ causes, ranging from playing with matches to setting off fireworks to arson. If evidence is found to suggest the fire was deliberately set, the RCMP could pursue charges. The fire was first spotted by an airborne forestry crew about nine miles   of Fort McMurray, a town of some 90, 000 people in the heart of Albertaâ€™s oil sands. Dry conditions, unseasonably hot weather and shifting winds quickly transformed the blaze from one that was largely in control to a â€œnasty, uglyâ€ inferno, in the words of the local fire chief, sending it swelling from about 1, 200 hectares in size to its current size of nearly 590, 000 hectares. As it grew, its flames breached Fort McMurrayâ€™s city limits, prompting the hurried evacuation of the burning city. Residents jumped in their cars  â€”   often with little more than the clothes on their backs  â€”   only to be trapped in gridlocked traffic as flames licked the highway.   â€œIt was something out of a movie,â€ resident Erica Decker said after the evacuation. â€œIt was absolutely apocalyptic, there were vehicles stranded everywhere, the sky was black and orange, there were so many people trapped. â€ After some 45 days of firefighting, authorities in Alberta said this week that crews had finally managed to gain the upper hand against the fire and had managed to halt its spread. Depending on weather conditions, it could take another month or two before the wildfire is completely contained and extinguished.  Earlier this month, the thousands of residents displaced by the fire began   the city, starting the sluggish process of rebuilding their lives amid the rubble. The blaze destroyed about 10% of the cityâ€™s homes. Oil sands projects in the region have slowly began ramping up production again, after the fire forced more than 1m barrels a day of oil sands production offline at one point.",518,564,"934836334581006337	934843848236216320	934844436483330049	982004607281844224	990738396061536256",fake

Baseball teams across the country held moments of silence after a gunman wielding an   rifle and a handgun opened fire inside a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday. At least 50 people were killed and the gunman died in a gunfight with SWAT officers, according to police. â€œWe begin with our thoughts and prayers for the Orlando community and all of those affected by the tragic events this early morning,â€ Father Geoff Rose of St Francis de Sales High School said Sunday at Nascarâ€™s race in Michigan. A moment of silence was also held prior to Sundayâ€™s Game 6 of the Stanley Cup final between the Penguins and Sharks. Many prominent athletes took to social media to express themselves in the wake of the incident. Shaquille Oâ€™Neal, who began his storied career with the Orlando Magic and is the most prominent star to ever play in the city, tweeted: Current Magic guard Shabazz Napier also chimed in: Michael Sam, the first openly gay player in NFL history, wrote a short essay on Instagram, stating in part that â€œ50 people lost their lives because of a hateful coward with a gun. Let this hateful act of terror of the #LGBTQ community be a wake up call for America. Men and women of all races, ages, and sexual orientation are being slaughtered because of hate crimes. How many more must die from a hate crime? We need to create awareness to ALL that hate is not the foundation of our nation. Friends DO NOT let this coward put fear into your hearts! !!â€ WNBA star Brittney Griner, also using the hashtag #prayfororlando, posted a picture of five hearts in the colors of the LGBT flag, with a red heart split in half. Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James, asked about the suspension of Warriors forward Draymond Green for Game 5 of the NBA finals because of a flagrant foul he committed against James in Game 4, began his answer by instead offering condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the shooting. â€œI think itâ€™s another hit for us as Americans and what we have to deal with in our world today, and it definitely puts things in perspective on basketball.

Speaking to National Public Radio, Chris Inglis, who retired in 2014 after 28 years at the agency, said the filmâ€™s narrative â€œwas a gross mischaracterisation of what NSAâ€™s purposes are. And a gross exaggeration of Edward Snowdenâ€™s own particular role in that. To the point where you could come away from looking at that movie, saying, â€˜Why are 50, 000 people at the NSA dead wrong? And one is absolutely correct? â€™â€ An NSA deputy director does feature in the film, played by Patrick Joseph Byrnes, and commissions Snowden to lead an important project in Hawaii. Inglis says he and Snowden never met and such a scene is â€œpreposterous   â€¦     for many reasonsâ€. â€œThat a deputy director would reach down to a contractor  â€”   whoâ€™s performing an important but relatively   function  â€”   and ask them to take on a Jason   activity? It simply exceeds all propriety. â€ Inglis told NPR he was concerned about what viewers would take from the film about the motives of the NSA and its employees, and expressed concern with its billing as â€œa dramatisation of actual eventsâ€. â€œDramatisation to me means you add the occasional exclamation point,â€ said Inglis. â€œYou bring in a musician to perhaps add some background music. But you donâ€™t tell a story that is fiction. â€ Inglis pointed to a scene in which Snowden completes an aptitude test that usually takes five hours in 38 minutes.  â€œClearly [heâ€™s] a clever person. But NSA makes a habit of hiring smart people. Extremely smart people. Also principled people. So he was clearly the former turns out he wasnâ€™t the latter. â€ The former deputy director does concede that Snowdenâ€™s own motive may not have been wholly   although it is unclear whether Stoneâ€™s film contributed to any reassessment.  â€œI do see him as a more nuanced character,â€ Inglis said. â€œSomewhere, there was an attempt or perhaps an intent on his part to do something noble. â€ However, he cast scorn on Snowdenâ€™s own suggestion  â€”   when the first trailer was released in April  â€”   that â€œ[f]or two minutes and 39 seconds, everybody at NSA just stopped workingâ€.  â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s true,â€ said Inglis. â€œI think Edward Snowden wants to be important. Who doesnâ€™t? Who doesnâ€™t want to matter?â€ Snowden opened in the US a week and a half ago, to mixed reviews and slightly disappointing box office returns, taking $8m on its first weekend of release.

politifact15097,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2017/target-recalls-water-absorbing-toys,Target Recalls Water Absorbing Toys Due to Serious Ingestion Hazard,"Batman has always been defined by his Batwear. Tim Burton ushered in a new era for Gothamâ€™s dark knight by jettisoning the familiar colour scheme sported by Adam West in the   1960s show in favour of typically gothic black and an armored, musclebound look. George Clooneyâ€™s awful Batnipples, intended as a paean to classical visions of the gods, came to define the floundering Joel Schumacher years. With Ben Affleck sporting a new goggled look in the upcoming Justice League, we look back at Batmanâ€™s classiest capes and darkest sartorial disasters. The camp tone of the   show and its 1966   movie heavily inspired Westâ€™s outfit, featuring a short cape because the actorâ€™s   kept stepping on it in   action scenes, and   eyebrows (serving to give the dark knight an eternally surprised expression) presumably to avoid the expense of moulding the caped crusaderâ€™s   into the famous cowl. To be fair to West and the showâ€™s writers, it is hard to look menacing when youâ€™re wearing your underpants over a pair of tights, so a comic approach was probably advisable. And at least Batmanâ€™s bargain bin gold utility belt always seemed to contain exactly the right weapon of choice to take down the relevant member of the caped crusaderâ€™s roguesâ€™ gallery.      Keaton might not have been the obvious choice to play Gothamâ€™s terrifying defender in the Tim Burton films, but who needs endless trips to the gym and a diet of raw eggs and protein powder when moulded rubber muscles and a fearsomely beaky cowl can serve just as well? Nevertheless, with the new black Batsuit featuring a design based on unyielding foam rubber that extended to his skull, the actor was faced with a whole new set of problems. Legend has it that the caped crusaderâ€™s famous â€œhero turnâ€ in 1989â€™s Batman and its 1991 sequel Batman Returns came about because Keaton simply had no alternative. The rigid suit meant he was physically incapable of turning his head. Gorgeous George might be best known for ruining the dark knight for a generation with those superimposed nipples in 1997â€™s execrable Batman  Robin, but Kilmer had them first (if not quite so pronounced) in 1995â€™s almost equally hideous Batman Forever. Clooney definitely wins the prize for worst Batman suit of all time, however, in the shape of the silver and blue outfit worn by our hero and his Batpals in the denouement of Joel Schumacherâ€™s   final turn in the directorâ€™s chair. This time there are not just nipples on show, but an enormous sculpted, excruciatingly outlined Batcodpiece. We should also mention that a different version of the suit features   ice skates, essential for taking on Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€™s Mr Freeze, or simply terrifying small children at your local rink.  A welcome return to sanity arrived in the shape of Christopher Nolanâ€™s   Batsuits for the Dark Knight trilogy, supposedly based on a discontinued Wayne Enterprises design for an armored military bodysuit that Bruce Wayne initially just paints black and sticks a Batsymbol on in 2005â€™s Batman Begins. But the most sensible revolution, after close to two decades of caped crusaders who are unable to really turn their heads, came with 2008â€™s The Dark Knight. Apparently at the behest of Christian Bale, who found the costume uncomfortable, Morgan Freemanâ€™s Lucius Fox simply develops a cowl thatâ€™s only loosely connected to the rest of the suit. Yes, it only took 19 years for Batman and his team to work out the importance of flexibility and actual peripheral vision when risking oneâ€™s life every night on the grim and bloody streets of Gotham. If Westâ€™s   suit, which has often been retained for the comics, makes the actor look slightly pudgy when compared to the statuesque physicality of some of his successors, Affleck was preposterously accused of being fat when he first pulled on his new Dark Knight   costume, supposedly made from a mix of kevlar and titanium but still with a   appearance, for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.  The truth is that a return to the woven look of Bill   Bats required the new dark knight to be in ridiculously impressive shape. A rather easier pitch was the movieâ€™s   inspired by the armor worn by Batman for his battle with Superman in Frank Millerâ€™s seminal 1986 graphic novel. And now hereâ€™s a third suit for Batfleck, which really is approaching Edna Mode levels of sartorial superhero extravagance. This one will be rolled out for Snyderâ€™s Justice League and reminds us of the begoggled look sported by Patrick Wilsonâ€™s Nite Owl in Snyderâ€™s splendid 2009 superhero epic Watchmen. Rumour has it that it features additional metal plating to allow Batman to take more of a pounding from his enemies, which sounds like a good idea after one of those Gotham scumbags managed to plunge a knife straight through the dark knightâ€™s costume and into his arm last time out.

Italian and French scientists have for the first time identified a threshold beyond which rising magma under the Earthâ€™s surface could trigger the release of fluids and gases at a   increased rate. This would cause the injection of   steam into surrounding rocks, said Giovanni Chiodini, a researcher at Italyâ€™s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Bologna. â€œHydrothermal rocks, if heated, can ultimately lose their mechanical resistance, causing an acceleration towards critical conditions,â€ he told AFP by email. He said it was not possible to say when  â€”   or if  â€”   the volcano would erupt but â€œit would be very dangerousâ€ if it did for about 500, 000 people living inside and near the caldera  â€”   the   depression created after a volcano blows its top. Chiodini said there was an urgent need to obtain a better understanding of Campi Flegreiâ€™s behaviour because of the risk to such a dense urban population.  Since 2005, Campi Flegrei has been undergoing what scientists call uplift, causing Italian authorities to raise the alert level in 2012 from green to yellow, signalling the need for active scientific monitoring. The pace of ground deformation and   seismic activity has recently increased. Two other active volcanoes  â€”   Rabaul in Papua New Guinea and Sierra Negra in the Galapagos  â€”   â€œboth showed acceleration in ground deformation before eruption with a pattern similar to that observed at Campi Flegrei,â€ Chiodini said. The Campi Flegrei caldera was formed 39, 000 years ago in an explosion that threw hundreds of cubic kilometres of lava, rock and debris into the air in the largest eruption in Europe in the past 200, 000 years.

The imagery of Oscar Isaacâ€™s character Apocalypse choking Mystique is sometimes accompanied by the tagline: â€œOnly the strong will surviveâ€. Actor and filmmaker Rose McGowan said there was â€œa major problem when the men and women at 20th Century Fox think casual violence against women is a way to market a filmâ€. In a statement, Fox said in highlighting the villainy of Apocalypse, â€œwe didnâ€™t immediately realise the upsetting connotation of this image in print formâ€. The studio apologised and said it was removing promotional materials with the image. Fox added it â€œwould never condone violence against womenâ€. McGowan shared a Facebook post criticising the posters with the comment, â€œFuck this shitâ€. â€œThere is a major problem when the men and women at 20th Century Fox think casual violence against women is the way to market a film,â€ she elaborated in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. â€œThere is no context in the ad, just a woman getting strangled.

Less than two weeks after the earthquake, at least 200 suspected new cases of cholera have been detected in the country, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) which is sending 1m cholera vaccines to Haiti at the end of this week. Aid agencies fear that without a major effort by the international community, survivors of the storm will face a fresh outbreak of the disease. â€œThere will be many more cases of cholera, and unnecessary deaths, all across areas affected by the hurricane if   cholera treatment and prevention response doesnâ€™t reach them immediately,â€ said Conor Shapiro, president and CEO of the St Boniface Haiti Foundation, which operates a hospital in the southern part of Haiti.  Hurricane Matthew killed at least 473 people, and 752 people are missing, according to the United Nationsâ€™ latest tally. And if access to food, water and shelter does not improve immediately, the death toll is expected to increase. In its wake, the hurricane left pools of stagnant water, overflowing rivers and dead bodies  â€”   creating a breeding ground for the waterborne disease. In the   regions, efforts to deliver water treatment equipment have been hampered by debris that still blocks roads. And even those places that have received support have reported â€œhugeâ€ shortages of clean drinking water, forcing people to drink stormwater, said Beatrice Lindstrom, staff attorney at the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH). â€œItâ€™s a race against time,â€ she said. Lindstromâ€™s group has led a campaign to hold the UN accountable for its role in the cholera outbreak that hit nine months after the January 2010 earthquake. The disease was previously unknown in Haiti, and overwhelming evidence suggests that it was introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers from Nepal. More than 9, 200 people have since died from cholera and more than 769, 000 have been treated in hospitals for the disease  â€”   and Lindstrom said that the hurricane has prompted fears of a fresh epidemic.  â€œIn the first month after cholera broke out, after the earthquake, a thousand people were impacted,â€ said Lindstrom. â€œWeâ€™re really afraid that the same thing will happen in this situation  â€”   it just seems like access to water is already so, so limited. â€  Those seeking treatment for the disease must confront a depleted healthcare system  â€”   a quarter of Haitiâ€™s healthcare facilities, including cholera treatment centers, have been destroyed.  â€œWhat Matthew didnâ€™t kill, cholera and infections are going to. Infections are coming in,â€ said the Haitian Health Foundation country director, Nadesha Mijoba, speaking from JÃ©rÃ©mie, a city of 30, 000 that was hit by the full force of the category 4 hurricane.  The foundation serves JÃ©rÃ©mie and 105 nearby mountain villages and is sending weekly food dispatches to 15 local orphanages, which have no refrigeration or storage. Of the foundationâ€™s 184 staff members, 130 were made homeless by the hurricane.  â€œThe situation was not easy after the earthquake, and with Hurricane Matthew, the situation has become more critical,â€ said Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se FrÃ©dÃ©rique Jean Pierre, the Haiti director for childrenâ€™s humanitarian group, Plan International. In some places, 80% of the roofs have been lost, and 100% of the crops  â€”   which are grown primarily to feed the people who harvest them  â€”   have been destroyed. â€œThe devastation will have a direct consequence on the population [and] will increase the malnutrition problems, mainly for children,â€ said Jean Pierre.  â€œIâ€™m not afraid to say it, but in another three, four months, Haitians are going to die of starvation,â€ Emmanuel Valcourt, a farmer in the south, told the Miami Herald. â€œI really donâ€™t see how weâ€™re going to rebuild. We donâ€™t have the financial means. We donâ€™t have a job that would have allowed us to have savings. The few animals that we had are all dead. â€   Poncelet, a WHO representative in Haiti, said crop destruction in Haiti is particularly devastating because the food is grown by people to feed themselves. â€œThat [food] has been washed away either by floods, and landslides and winds,â€ said Poncelet.  He said that since only 10% of the countryâ€™s population was affected by the hurricane, recovery efforts and resources should be channeled through the countryâ€™s remaining population and institutions. â€œChanneling through institutions that exist in the country would be the most efficient,â€ Poncelet said.  But amid these concerns about food and shelter, the threat of contaminated water reigns.  â€œIt really does seem like this is one of the most urgent situations thatâ€™s facing people after the hurricane,â€ said IJDHâ€™s Lindstrom. â€œThe reports weâ€™re getting from the ground so far are pretty horrific. There are still a number of towns that are completely cut off from aid because they are so inaccessible by road and even the ones who are slowly getting aid in, there is a huge shortage of potable water,â€ she said.  Plan Internationalâ€™s Jean Pierre said: â€œAll our action through this emergency response will be to make sure children are safe and their families have some opportunities, some capacities to return to the normal life. â€  ",469,74,"915177868090576896	915180058641408002	915180926665203712	915185277953507328	915186624589451265	915191518599802880	915193182291361792	915226115870007296	915229923274629120	915248297912209408	915248803220983809	915256695797858305	915261012902842368	915262898154258433	915283791102595073	915285672243720193	915310890341355522	915317634534658048	915336341122093057	915368778036281344	915373535878684672	915378386410782720	915381425821466624	915381726150524929	915388123000872960	915388864331579392	915392163181101056	915428766385664000	915431351557296128	915467881491640320	915470424053551104	915488090923266048	915497575243026432	915520879773220865	915550128861216769	915551345993756672	915559778017058817	915561133335105536	915569739782553600	915570452659036165	915575038656548865	915575541268385792	915576613919760384	915579051812700160	915610112512843776	915611508788334592	915615688772902914	915628749277732864	915629606937313280	915652882766221312	915661020999405570	915691443884380163	915691570384470020	915691913407279104	915691960211591169	915724148281888769	915730110388609025	915730131699847168	915742020727115782	915837844446482432	915882053245136896	915902344566640641	915918468247146496	915924299218919424	915979410905239552	915979865479815169	915993035846111232	916033400234024966	916042347753873408	916064122944417792	916071726047481861	916102189596078080	916184102335680512	916347442580226048	916676371862171648	916703988397035521	916706083611189248	916804551402852352	917127662312632327	917205663884886016	917638274138628096	918142184070762496	918211532542025729	919947696345108481	920635783928844288	920645813616947201	921388080807813120	921925116421865472	923234009299202048	927010683585097729",fake

Kaepernick has received criticism from figures as varied as Donald Trump and Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh over what he says is a protest against the oppression of African Americans in the United States. On Monday night, Brown gave support to Kaepernick. â€œHeâ€™s within his rights, and heâ€™s telling the truth as he sees it. I am with him 100%,â€ Brown said on the NFL Network. Brown said he would not have chosen the same method as Kaepernick, but said the issues he raised are vital. â€œThe No1 issue in the country for me is black homicide, young black men killing young black men,â€ Brown said. The Hall of Fame running back added that athletes such as Kaepernick can play an important role in shaping society. â€œThe young men of today are stepping up,â€ Brown said. â€œFor so many years they did not step up. â€ In a strange episode on Tuesday, the former New England Patriots star Rodney Harrison said Kaepernick didnâ€™t understand the issues because he is â€œnot blackâ€.

Judge Tracie Brown revoked Chahalâ€™s probation and ordered him to spend 12 months in jail for allegedly assaulting a second woman months after pleading guilty in the first domestic violence case. Chahalâ€™s lawyer, however, said he would appeal the ruling, and the defendant was released on bail. When he arrived, Chahal rushed past a crowd of reporters outside the packed San Francisco courtroom without commenting. He sat stoic throughout the hearing and declined to make a statement to the judge.  Chahal, who was pushed out as chief executive officer of RadiumOne, an online advertising network, was originally facing 47 serious felony charges for the 5 August 2013 attack. Police officials said that a   security camera video they obtained showed the entrepreneur hitting and kicking his then girlfriend 117 times and attempting to suffocate her inside his $7m San Francisco penthouse. Chahalâ€™s lawyers, however, claimed that police had illegally seized the video, and a judge ruled that the footage was inadmissible despite prosecutorsâ€™ argument that officers didnâ€™t have time to secure a warrant out of fear that the tech executive would erase the footage. Without the video, most of the charges were dropped, and Chahal, 34, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor battery charges of domestic violence. A deal he struck in April 2014 allowed him to avoid jail time if he conducted a   domestic violence rehabilitation course and 25 hours of community service. The disgraced multimillionaire has repeatedly attempted to downplay the seriousness of the case, claiming that he lost his temper during a â€œnormal argumentâ€ with his girlfriend and that he did not kick and punch her 117 times. He said the $500 fine he paid was the â€œequivalent of a speeding ticketâ€ and â€œin no way reflects the toll that this ordeal has exacted on meâ€. In Silicon Valley, critics have argued that Chahalâ€™s case and the lack of serious consequences he faced highlight the way in which privileged and wealthy businessmen can get away with serious misconduct. Chahalâ€™s plea bargain also stipulated that he would be on probation for three years, but on 17 September 2014, prosecutors say he attacked another woman in his home, leading to another arrest. This second victim told police that Chahal had repeatedly kicked her and that when she discussed getting a restraining order against him, he threatened to report her to immigration authorities.  Chahalâ€™s lawyers responded by attempting to attack the credibility of the woman in court, alleging that she was in a sham marriage to get a US visa. The woman has returned to her native South Korea and did not appear at a recent San Francisco hearing. Although the victim did not testify, San Francisco superior court judge Brown ruled last month that Chahal had violated probation and ordered him to surrender his passports.  Prosecutor Oâ€™Bryan Kenney had urged the judge to sentence Chahal to the maximum of 18 months in jail, saying: â€œHis attitude   â€¦     has consisted of a complete lack of remorse   â€¦     He clearly didnâ€™t get the message. â€ In front of a    crowd, Kenney showed the judge excerpts of the video of the original assault on his laptop, but the audience was not able to view it. â€œItâ€™s difficult to watch that conduct,â€ Kenney said, adding, â€œHe has had a chance, and further domestic violence counseling   â€¦     I donâ€™t think would have a significant impact. â€ Judge Brown said she would not allow the footage to be publicly released. After he was ousted at RadiumOne, Chahal   Gravity4, another San   ad tech company. In April of 2015, Erika Alonso, a former Gravity4 marketing executive, sued Chahal for gender discrimination, harassment and illegal surveillance, citing his â€œpattern and practice of humiliating and abusing women who dared to question Chahal, a serial entrepreneur with a legendary temperâ€. The complaint alleged that Chahal regularly belittled Alonso, who is over 40 years old, and treated younger male employees much more favorably. â€œRather than being allowed to perform her duties,â€ the complaint read, â€œAlonso was used repeatedly as bait to attract reporters in an attempt to deflect from Chahalâ€™s violent past, and to assist him in promoting stories on his bid to take over RadiumOne. â€ At one point, Chahal told Alonso to contact a prominent female news anchor, saying, â€œYouâ€™re a woman, appeal to her!â€ according to the suit. Chahal and other Gravity4 representatives said the allegations were false, but months later, the CEO was sued a second time by Yousef Khraibut, a    former employee. Khraibut, who has citizenship in Canada and Kuwait, alleged that Chahal said he would â€œbeat the shit out ofâ€ him and threatened to â€œsend Khraibut back to Canada â€˜tonightâ€™â€. Chahal also allegedly directed ethnic slurs at Khraibut, calling him a â€œterroristâ€ and saying that Isis terrorists were â€œhis peopleâ€. After the judge ruled that he had violated probation last month, Chahal stepped down as Gravity4 CEO. James Lassart, Chahalâ€™s lawyer, tried again to discredit the second victim in court on Friday, telling the judge: â€œSheâ€™s not willing to come into a courtroom   â€¦     Her word is untrustworthy. â€ Lassart added, â€œThe constitution requires that my client be allowed to confront his accuser. â€ The defense lawyer asked the judge to grant Chahal a sentence of electronic monitoring or community service and consider that the defendant suffers from a functional neurological disorder, saying his health would be exacerbated by stress. Lassart also asked that the judge note Chahalâ€™s charitable donations, saying, â€œHe has contributed to and supported and advanced the cause of the stopping of abuse of children. â€ After the hearing, the defense lawyer criticized the ruling, arguing that when a victim doesnâ€™t testify, â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s appropriate for someone to have their liberty taken away. â€  Chahal pushed his way through a mob of cameras on his way out and refused to answer questions.",387,181,,fake

Alexievich was not referring to her nonfiction work and the oral histories of the former Soviet Union that won her the Nobel prize in literature. She was talking about the events in her own history that pushed her into a lifetime of chronicling politics and suffering. â€œI grew up in a village after the war and in the village there were almost only womenâ€  â€”   because every fourth man was killed in the resistance, Alexievich added. â€œI do not remember any questions in my childhood other than questions about death and about loss, and it was clear that the books that filled the house were not as interesting as the conversations outside. â€ By the time Alexievich graduated from college with a degree in journalism, she had already decided that it was these oral histories â€œnot required by the newspaperâ€ that were most interesting to her. Her Nobel win, in 2015, marked the first time the prize has ever been given to a writer from Belarus. Speaking with the journalist Masha Gessen in June at the New York Public Library (Anatoli Samochornov translated her answers into English) Alexievich discussed the particular joys of that form, the danger of demonizing Putin, and the morality of art. Much of Alexievichâ€™s work deals with rewritten memory, and what she calls â€œsmall executionersâ€ or the millions who denounced others and later had to live next to those they sent to the gulag. Politics, then and now, often loses focus on these â€œabsolutely normal, everyday peopleâ€ who are able to excuse themselves in every situation, even as they become prison guards. â€œWe have always lived in that   world where good and evil were mixed up,â€ says Alexievich. â€œToday we are saying â€˜Putin! Putin! Putin!â€™ all the time, and I see caricatures where Putin is portrayed as Putin. But we need to talk about a collective Putin, a Putin that is in every human being. â€ The danger today, according to Alexievich, is not any one person like Putin, or even Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who persecuted Alexievich until she left the country (and yet who congratulated her on last yearâ€™s Nobel win). Instead, Alexievich worries about the myth of patriotism and the character of the â€œred manâ€ whom she likens to her own father. He studied journalism, fought in the second world war and until the end of his life remained a communist. He raised his children to believe that they lived in the best country in the world and should be ready to give up their lives for it at first notice.  But when Alexievich returned from reporting on the   war and said to him, â€œFather, we are murderers. This is not the great country you told us,â€ he had no reply. He, an â€œhonest and clever manâ€ began to cry, because he knew the truth. Alexievich hopes to make all this machinery of power clear through conversations with ordinary people, which she sees as very different from a traditional journalistic endeavor. â€œI come to them as a friend, I come to them as a neighbor in time,â€ she says. â€œItâ€™s not an interview. We talk about life. â€  Her subjects share intimate stories that are never â€œjust aboutâ€ Chernobyl or war. Theyâ€™re about life, love, betrayal, and often topics that Alexievich herself says she might not have divulged. Still, she remains   about the   dark side of art because there is always the danger of aestheticizing suffering. â€œArt is always kind of snooping and listening in,â€ she says, recounting a story about Leo Tolstoy. It is said that when Tolstoy was doing research for The Death of Ivan Ilyich, he would go to the the houses of acquaintances and sit there for a long time, watching as people died. â€œAt one point, one elderly man chased him away and said, â€˜Go away, you evil man, this is my personal business and I am doing it alone,â€™â€ Alexievich says. â€œBut because of his action, this genius of a story is written. I donâ€™t think we should be deceived that art is such a moral thing. â€ Gessen, noting that Alexievichâ€™s speciality is â€œtalking to people who are looking for safetyâ€ asked for her thoughts about the murder of 49 people at a gay club in Orlando this past weekend. Many LGBT people from the former Soviet Union came to the US for safety, but where is that safety now? â€œI think that that feeling of security is perhaps lost and is an illusion,â€ Alexievich replies. â€œIn Belarus, we had a woman who basically fled to Israel for security and then to Spain, and in Spain she got caught up in this horrible terrorist attack. There is not really a place where you can run to. â€ Now, after writing about nuclear disaster and pain, Alexievich is turning her attention to a different subject: love, in â€œevery combination possibleâ€. But in some ways, the love angle is not so different from those of her other books: â€œI want to explore,â€ she says, â€œwhat happens when people live without it.

politifact14026,politicass.com/fox-news-sandra-smith-everybody-see-united-airlines-passengers-behavior-not-genuine-american/,Fox News Sandra Smith: “Everybody Could See From The United Airlines Passenger’s Behavior That He Was Not A Genuine American”,"Brazil were held to a goalless draw by   South Africa on the opening day of the menâ€™s Olympic football tournament in Brasilia. The home side were bolstered by the presences of Neymar and the new Manchester City signing Gabriel JÃ©sus  but struggled for inspiration against   visitors who held firm despite the dismissal of Mothobi Mvala shortly before the hour for a second yellow card. JÃ©sus came close to giving Brazil  â€”   and City  â€”   fans something to cheer when he hit the post 22 minutes from time when it seemed easier to score, but overall it was a disappointing start to a competition that RogÃ©rio Micaleâ€™s team is widely expected to win. The other Group A fixture, between Iraq and Denmark, finished goalless at the same venue in front of a tiny crowd despite both sides having chances to win. The dayâ€™s most entertaining game came in Group C and saw Germany hold the defending champions Mexico to a   draw in Rio. Oribe Peralta opened the scoring for Mexico after 52 minutes, with the Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry quickly levelling the scores. Rodolfo Pizarro restored the advantage but Matthias Ginterâ€™s 78th minute equaliser. In that groupâ€™s other game, South Korea handed Fiji a humbling   defeat. Honduras defeated Algeria   in the opening match of Group D, with their opponents mounting spirited comebacks from   and   down without being able to achieve parity. In that groupâ€™s other encounter, Portugal defeated Argentina   with substitute PitÃ© Trabulo putting the result beyond doubt for Rui Jorgeâ€™s team after Goncalo PaciÃªnciaâ€™s 66th minute opener. In that encounter, Diego Simeoneâ€™s son Giovanni also appeared as a 78th minute substitute for Argentina.",993,316,"852343849515196416	853483245907968001",fake
politifact13893,http://flashnewscorner.com/obamas-mother-law-charged-larceny-fraud/,flashnewscorner.com,"A senior adviser to Donald Trump has confirmed that the   met UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage, saying the two men discussed â€œfreedom and winningâ€. Farage later indicated he and Trump had discussed the placing of a bust of Sir Winston Churchill â€œback in [the] Oval Officeâ€. Kellyanne Conway, Trumpâ€™s campaign manager in the last months of the presidential campaign, left Trump Tower in New York two hours after Farage had been seen to arrive on Saturday. â€œAll these meetings are incredibly productive,â€ Conway told the Guardian. Farage had previously spent time with Trump, who regularly invoked Brexit as an example of the success coming his way, at a campaign rally and after a presidential debate. Inside the tower, Conway told reporters: â€œI think they enjoy each otherâ€™s company. â€ The interim Ukip leader is the first British politician to meet Trump following his election victory. The meeting is likely to cause concern in Downing Street, following reports that the â€œspecial relationshipâ€ between the US and UK could be more difficult to maintain under the new president. Britainâ€™s prime minister, Theresa May, was only the 11th world leader called by Trump after his victory on Tuesday. On Saturday evening, Farage sent a tweet that was accompanied by a picture of the two men smiling broadly in front of a pair of gold doors: He added: â€œ[Donald Trumpâ€™s] support for the   relationship is very strong. This is a man with whom we can do business. â€œEspecially pleased at [his] very positive reaction to idea that Sir Winston Churchillâ€™s bust should be put back in Oval Office. â€ Farage was referring to a running rightwing sore over the alleged removal by Barack Obama of a bust that was kept in the Oval Office by George W Bush, and whether such an alleged action made the current president  . Foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a leader with Farage of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, wrote in April that it did. Saturdayâ€™s intrigue began at 1. 50pm local time, when Farage walked into the lobby of Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue skyscraper in which Trump lives and from which he runs his business empire.  Trump and key advisers have been meeting at the building since the  â€™s return from Washington DC, where he met Barack Obama and Republican congressional leaders on Thursday. Asked by reporters seeking news of plans and appointments if Trump had invited him, and if he was helping with the Republicanâ€™s transition to the White House, Farage said: â€œWeâ€™re just tourists. â€ Farage met and served Trump on the campaign trail, speaking for him at a rally in Mississippi in August and working the   spin room after the second debate against Hillary Clinton, in St Louis in early October. His arrival at Trump Tower came just after   Michael Moore left the building, which was surrounded by a heavy New York police presence but open to the public at lobby level.  Moore attracted attention when he walked into the lobby at 1. 10pm, as a   protest march neared. â€œI just thought Iâ€™d see if I could get into Trump Tower and ride the famous escalator,â€ he said, adding that he was broadcasting his visit on Facebook Live. Police subsequently stopped the protest march a block away, at East 55th Street, and closed the lobby to the public. Earlier, speaking on Fox News, Farage said Trump must meet May to mend fences between the UK and the US. Farage said Mayâ€™s team had been â€œquite rudeâ€ about the   but that Trump had â€œgot to meet herâ€. â€œTrump is an anglophile,â€ he said. â€œHe understands and recognises what our two great nations have done together, between us, and thank goodness weâ€™re coming to the end of an American president who loathed us. â€œOne of the things we can do between us is a sensible trade relationship, cut tariffs. Weâ€™re massive investors in each otherâ€™s countries. Thereâ€™s a brighter future. â€ Asked to comment on the Brexit referendum, Farage said it had given â€œordinary little people the chance to say what they thoughtâ€.  â€œBrexit was the first real kick back against the liberal establishment, which has dominated with its friends in big business and the big banks, dominated the world for the last couple of decades,â€ he said.  â€œWhat we have to do is follow the example given to us over 30 years ago by Reagan and Thatcher. They both won   elections   â€¦     they made the world a better place. â€ Farage was in Florida earlier this week for a private meeting. Earlier on Saturday Ukip sources said no firm meeting was scheduled with the   but said Farage would be delighted if the opportunity arose. Farage has also suggested that â€œinsultingâ€ comments senior Tories made about Trump may have been the reason for May coming so low down on the  â€™s list of foreign leaders to call.  Farageâ€™s remarks came after it emerged that the prime ministerâ€™s two joint chiefs of staff had attacked Trump on social media before taking up their current posts. Fiona Hill posted last December: â€œDonald Trump is a chump,â€ while Nick Timothy wrote in March: â€œAmerican politics was depressing enough before Trump took off. â€ Farage claimed this week to have been â€œthe catalystâ€ for Trumpâ€™s rise. In turn, Trump often referred to Brexit on the campaign trail, likening his predicted victory to the shock result in the referendum on membership of the European Union. In an interview with TalkRadio from Spain before he left for the US, Farage said he was â€œthe catalystâ€ for the downfall of â€œthe Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, have made themselves rich and ruined our countriesâ€.    He also joked about the idea of Trump sexually assaulting May when he met her, and described outgoing president Barack Obama as a â€œcreatureâ€. Asked about Trumpâ€™s possible future behaviour after he was accused of a series of sexual assaults, which he denies, Farage added: â€œIf it comes to it, I could be there as the responsible adult role, to make sure everythingâ€™s OK. â€ A Downing Street source said Farageâ€™s activities in the US were an irrelevance to the British government. â€œHe has no role whatsoever. We wonâ€™t be talking to him,â€ the source said.  Meanwhile, Axel Schafer, a senior member of Angela Merkelâ€™s Social Democrat coalition, said May was delusional if she thought she could broker a good trade deal with Trump. Schafer told the Times that the likelihood of a speedy and preferential trade agreement between the UK and the US had changed. â€œEven before Tuesday the chances were rather low, now the hope for this kind of deal seems delusional,â€ he said. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, described Trumpâ€™s election as a â€œglobal   callâ€ that showed that Britain must take back control from the billionaires bankrolling the Tories.  Corbyn accused the   of targeting the fears of people who feel left behind by the economic change of globalisation. He said that instead of giving them solutions, he had shifted the blame to other sections of society. â€œWe have no idea how Donald Trump proposes to â€˜make America great againâ€™ and Theresa Mayâ€™s Tories offer slogans, but no solutions, for most people in Britain,â€ he said.  â€œWe wonâ€™t tackle the damage done by elite globalisation just by leaving the EU. We wonâ€™t â€˜take back controlâ€™ unless we take on the corporate vested interests that control our energy, our transport, and have infiltrated our public services.  â€œOne thing is for sure.

politifact14756,www.newsweek.com/donna-brazile-book-seth-rich-dnc-murder-conspiracy-702838,"DNC’s Donna Brazile Dedicated Her Book to ‘Patriot’ Seth Rich, Whose Death Made Her Fear for Her Own Life","Volkswagen has agreed to pay US vehicle owners an average of about $5, 000 apiece to settle claims from its diesel emissions cheating scandal, two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday. The total price tag for the repayments and other fines is said to exceed $10. 2bn. The company will still have to settle foreign suits over allegations that it lied about its emissions standards, in addition to claims brought by other US agencies. The US justice department is conducting a separate criminal inquiry of the automaker, which could also result in a hefty fine. Most of the money would go to compensate 482, 000 owners of cars with   diesel engines that were programmed to turn on emissions controls during lab tests and turn them off while on the road, said the people, who asked not to be identified because a judge has issued a gag order in the case. The news was first reported by Associated Press and Bloomberg. One of the people said the agreement was tentative and could change by the time the terms are officially announced by the judge. The bulk of the cash would be used to fix the cars, buy them back and compensate owners. Some funds would go to government agencies as penalties and for a program to remediate the environmental damage caused by pollution, the person said. Carl Tobias, Williams Chair in law at the University of Richmond Law School in Virginia, said that Volkswagen would only have agreed to the deal if it believed the enormous sum was still less than ongoing lawsuits would cost the company. â€œIf you think about how many owners there are of these vehicles and you do that math, if you were to litigate each of them, it would be huge,â€ Tobias said. â€œThose kinds of expenses theyâ€™re going to avoid in the future. I saw something like 600 suits and some of them are class action. â€  Similar suits across the country are being consolidated before San Francisco judge Charles Breyer. Tobias said he did not expect any official announcement of the deal before Tuesday, when the parties in the case are set to appear before Breyer. Owners would have a choice between selling their vehicles back to VW at the value before the scandal broke on 18 September 2015, or keeping the cars and letting the company repair them. Either way, they would also get $1, 000 to $7, 000 depending on their carâ€™s age, with an average payment of $5, 000, one of the people said. The carmaker has set aside $16. 2bn (Â£11bn) to deal with the scandal. It admitted last September that 11m diesel cars had been fitted with software that allowed them to cheat emissions tests. Volkswagen still faces a string of regulatory and legal cases around the world. Attorneys representing owners, VW and government agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency have not yet agreed on the steps VW will take to repair the cars, the person said. Any fix would be expensive and would probably require a bigger catalytic converter or injection of the chemical urea into the exhaust to help neutralize the pollution. The EPA has said the cars, which include many of VWâ€™s most popular models, can give off more than 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide, which can cause respiratory problems in humans. On Wednesday. at the first annual meeting since the carmaker became embroiled in the emissions scandal, Volkswagen shareholders accused its executives of overseeing a shambles that has led to the carmakerâ€™s first annual loss in 20 years and demanded changes to the management structure. Ulrich Hocker, head of the German shareholder association DSW, said there had been a collective failure by the management board. â€œWe are looking at a shambles,â€ he said.

All signs point to Trump suffering a rout in two weeks, with Clintonâ€™s chances of victory north of 80 or 90% according to statistical analysis from both the New York Times and FiveThirtyEight. Donald Trump is the most unpopular candidate in modern history, and in elections past, heâ€™d be dragging the rest of the party to a historic defeat in Congress as well. But despite all this, thereâ€™s almost no chance the Republicans will lose control of the House of Representatives this election  â€”   or in the one after it  â€”   since Republicans in statehouses across the country have fixed the election process by redrawing the congressional district maps in several key states in 2010. They can retain a majority even when Democrats received far more total votes. (The Washington Post has a helpful graphic that explains exactly how gerrymandering works.) Former Salon editor in chief David Daley has a new book out on the subject and described how the Republicans accomplished this   feat in a recent interview:  It was a   plan. In 2010, they had to take control of all of the chambers. In 2011, they sat down with some of the most skilled mapmakers in the country, and they drew lines with the express intent of using redistricting as a partisan hammer to lock in control of the House for the next decade. The results were dramatic. As Voxâ€™s Andrew Prokop explained this week, â€œWhen Americans voted for the House in 2012, Democratic candidates won 1. 4 million more votes than Republicans. Yet after the dust settled, the GOP ended up with a   majority in the chamber. â€ The liberal blog Daily Kos conducted a comprehensive study of gerrymandering in the 2012 House election and concluding that it â€œlikely cost Democrats a net of 25 seats in 2012, more than the 17 they needed to claim a majority that year, and far more than the eight they actually did gain. â€ Take Ohio, for example, which is generally a battleground state in presidential elections and is pretty evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Because of the radical redistricting Ohio Republicans implemented in 2010, they were able to carve up the map so that they have 75% of Ohio House seats. Itâ€™s so bad, a recent study showed you can predict the results of any race in Ohio with a virtual certainty just by knowing the political makeup of a particular district. You can see how gerrymandering can manipulate election results in the Guardianâ€™s excellent look at â€œthe nationâ€™s most gerrymandered districtâ€ in North Carolina, which was so narrow at one point state representative Mickey Michaux, a Democrat from Durham, once said: â€œIf you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, youâ€™d kill most of the people in the district. â€ The United States district map would look radically different if computers, rather than partisan humans, drew the maps based on US census data. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s encouraging that President Obama will reportedly make redistricting reform a central part of his   plans. Given the extent to which it affects our elections, itâ€™s an underreported problem  â€”   and until it becomes a national scandal, it will persist. Gerrymandering has several effects beyond just making it easier for one party to control the majority of seats in the House. It drives down voter turnout, since so many elections are lopsided and unopposed. It increases polarization and deadlock in Congress since a lot of congressional members donâ€™t have to worry about a serious challenger from the other party. It also deprives minority groups of political power. It isnâ€™t a new problem the practice is almost as old as the country itself, and Democrats have engaged in it as well. But no one has perfected it as well as Republicans did in 2010, and until the practice is done away with once and for all, democracy will suffer.",663,948,"878340953655787521	878368242091270144",fake
politifact15270,http://usanews24h.tk/index.php/2018/04/12/obama-announces-bid-to-become-un-secretary-general/,Obama Announces Bid To Become UN Secretary General – Usa News,"When Gary Antuanne Russell lost his light middleweight   to Uzbekistanâ€™s Fazliddin Gaibnazarov in a   on Tuesday afternoon boos poured down from the US contingent. â€œHe got robbed, this is fucked up,â€ shouted his father Gary Russell Sr. â€œGary Russell was robbed  â€”   clearly, clearly,â€ Floyd Mayweather Jr later told reporters at the Olympic boxing venue where he had come to watch the afternoon fights. On a day when the US should be celebrating another boxing medal with Shakur Stevenson winning at least a bantamweight bronze, the conversation was about a loss that puzzled most who watched it. Russell appeared to knock Gaibnazarov across the ring, especially in the last two rounds and yet the judges awarded the first two rounds, and the fight, to the Uzbek. This immediately set off outrage among an American contingent that had just finished questioning Russian Vladimir Nikitinâ€™s victory over Irelandâ€™s Michael Conlan less than an hour before Russellâ€™s loss. Conlan later said â€œamateur boxing stinks from the core right to the top. â€ US coach Billy Walsh also lashed out. â€œUzbekistan they are going to be the best team here they are winning everything even when you beat them you canâ€™t beat them,â€ he said. Many affiliated with the American team said they suspected Russell was the victim of a rigged bout. â€œHe kept the pressure on he landed more solid punches,â€ Gary Russell Sr told the Guardian. â€œHe kept the pressure on . .. but you know if heâ€™s favored to win thatâ€™s how itâ€™s going to be. The only way you can take that out of the judges hands is to knock him out. Just knock him out. Thats the ultimate in prize fighting. â€ Kay Koroma, an assistant coach with the US team, referenced a Guardian story from two weeks ago that outlined corruption in AIBA, the body that oversees Olympic boxing, and shook his head as he talked about the decision in Russellâ€™s fight. â€œI mean for someone to write something like that and for this to be going on?â€ Koroma said. â€œYou got to wonder is this whatâ€™s really happening. Have they already made who is going to be an Olympic medalist?â€ â€œIâ€™m starting to believe [AIBA] are doing something,â€ he later said. â€œItâ€™s disgusting. â€ In the midst of the US outrage, Antuanne Russell walked in to talk to journalists with his shoulders slumped and eyes downcast. â€œIâ€™m hurt, Iâ€™m hurt, Iâ€™m hurt,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m really hurt. First round he fought competitive which it should have been but even that round I thought I won. The second two rounds I thought I had pulled away from him even if it was a little sloppy. I believe I did more than enough to outscore [him] and be aggressive and more. â€ He knew during the fight that he was trailing. A friend following on television had run up to his parents as they stood in the stands and said he had lost the first round. Immediately, Gary Sr shouted out to his son in the ring: â€œYou got to go get them, they got your ass down!â€ Antuanne became even more aggressive, connecting several times on hooks that slowed Gaibnazarov. When the report came back between the second and third rounds that Russell had lost that round too, Gary Sr and his wife Lawan leaned on the railing and began screaming louder. â€œYou canâ€™t wait, you got to let it go!â€ But as the fight concluded with Russell again landing several shots, even knocking Gaibnazarov to his knees at the final bell, the Russells knew their son would not get his decision. Gary Sr hoisted himself up on the railing and shouted to Antuanne, who seemed to understand the finality of his defeat even before it was announced. â€œHey Antuanne! I love you baby!â€ Gary Sr screamed. Antuanne nodded. Later in the interview area, Antuanne sighed. As the last of a line of six brothers named Gary Russell  â€”   four of whom are boxers  â€”   he was the familyâ€™s final hope for an Olympic medal. He had vowed to bring one home. Instead, he was done, the loser of a fight that many believed he had won. He was asked if the inconsistent judging made him wary going into his fight. â€œYeah, that puts a lot of frustration on people,â€ he said. Then he was gone.

politifact15532,http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/mexico-next-president-invasion-1-a/,MEXICO’S NEXT PRESIDENT Calls for An Invasion Of The US….,"Rupi Kaur is planning what she calls a dinner of Queens. Come this fall, she says, â€œweâ€™re going to go to the bougiest place where thereâ€™s no people of colour. Weâ€™re just going to sit down looking so fly and have a really expensive dinnerâ€. Her eyes light up as she continues: â€œWeâ€™re going to be sitting down and negotiating with multimillionaires because we as brown women can and should. Weâ€™re allowed to be in these spaces. â€  The night out  â€”   which will mark Kaurâ€™s 24th birthday  â€”   is rather fitting. This young poet from the suburbs of Toronto has fashioned a career out of forcing herself into places where sheâ€™s least expected whether itâ€™s the New York Times bestseller list or challenging social media to rethink how it sees menstruation. It was the latter that catapulted Kaur into headlines in 2015. After Instagram banned a photo, published as part of a university assignment, showing Kaur lying in bed with her pyjamas and sheets stained with a small amount of menstrual blood, Kaur fought back. She pointed out the hypocrisy of being censored by a site that readily publishes photos of underage girls who are â€œobjectifiedâ€ and â€œpornifiedâ€. Followers flocked to her, cheering her on as she added, â€œI will not apologise for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in underwear but not be okay with a small leak. â€ Instagram backed down. Insults and death threats were launched at Kaur, but her followers on Instagram grew seven times over. A spoken word artist who had been told at times that she was too aggressive for certain venues or made some people uncomfortable, Kaur wondered if her hundreds of thousands of followers would all stick around for what was coming next. She began releasing short poems to her followers  â€”   simple, raw lines that tackled tough topics such as rape, domestic violence and alcoholism. â€œThat was really scary,â€ she says over coffee one sunny afternoon in Toronto. â€œBut they did. They stayed for the poetry and that was such a beautiful gift in disguise. â€ In 2014 she   a collection of her poetry, accompanied by her own sketches, titled Milk and Honey. It was a bold move, one made amid warnings that   would bar her from prestigious literary circles. But the traditional path of submitting her work to anthologies, magazines and journals was yielding little success. â€œThere was no market for poetry about trauma, abuse, loss, love and healing through the lens of a   immigrant woman,â€ she says.  The book was   in October 2015. The book climbed bestseller lists, earning Kaur an audience far beyond those she had captured through social media. â€œWhich is so weird,â€ she says. â€œHow does a    white woman relate to this?â€  The reach of her writing hit her at a reading in San Francisco last year. As she neared the bookstore she saw a long line that snaked down four blocks and realised the crowd was there to see her. â€œThat was the moment that I was like wow, this is crazy. Itâ€™s going to be crazy. Itâ€™s been that way since, which is really cool. â€  No longer did it feel like she was casting her poetry into the vast online world and waiting to see if anyone would notice. Now it felt like the world was watching as Kaur, the child of Indian immigrants to Canada, sought to find her place using an unconventional recipe of poetry and social media. Part of a generation of poets dubbed Instapoets for their online reach, Kaur struggled to strike a balance between the side of social media that had nursed her unlikely career  â€”   â€œ10 years ago, who was going to embrace the story of a young brown woman?â€  â€”   and the other, darker side of social media where insults and threats are hurled freely. While she tries to stay accessible to what she calls her grassroots community, she stays off social media for the most part. â€œItâ€™s hard because I feel like itâ€™s such a big stage for my work,â€ she says. Another tension lies in the norms impressed upon her during her strict upbringing in a     community. â€œFor South Asian women, youâ€™re supposed to be quiet and not have those opinions. â€ When she began publicly addressing topics like rape, menstruation and domestic abuse, her parents would wonder what her hypothetical    might think one day. â€œAnd I would be like, then why did you teach me to say things out loud?â€ Since the release of her book, her family has rallied around her, supporting her work. But sheâ€™s often reminded of the limits sheâ€™s railing against when she performs in Brampton, the suburban city on the outskirts of Toronto where she grew up and where the South Asian population now outnumbers all other groups. â€œI thought that I would go to Brampton and do readings there and it would be filled with Punjabi people. Itâ€™s not,â€ she says. â€œTheyâ€™re very timid. I think poetry and this form of expression is still kind of new and thereâ€™s a lot of hiding happening. â€ But there are moments during those shows that validate Kaurâ€™s drive to constantly force her way past boundaries. â€œWhen you see someone who looks like your mom there and sheâ€™s like â€˜this puts so much of my pain into something concrete that I can hold,â€™â€ she says. â€œThatâ€™s when Iâ€™m like okay, Iâ€™m doing something right and I just want to keep doing it. â€",971,867,"1010550223674863616	1010550563656871936	1010568751534755840	1010569590924087297	1010570532264300545	1010585940367167489	1010597475047100423	1010602150550908928	1010614230800723968	1010614392789131270	1010675929058816000	1010675963406028801	1010687572807471105	1010725213271678976	1010732983966486530	1010736876410494976	1010876791911862273	1010893828578934785	1010933155933704193	1010949237490606081	1010949350531518466	1010955056764608512	1010989033625812992	1011024203271884800	1011043062695555073	1011044470534516737	1011047953497280512	1011072899074031616	1011085319553372162	1011228988801335297	1011259809163763715	1011265659534180357	1011316297982935044	1011333636422078467	1011370520359653376	1011384701863514112	1011508233247305728	1011790951889567744	1011801190768824320	1011933454831931393	1012036160061952005	1012082519976468480	1012102213278289922	1012123142238756870	1012177212827582464	1012491305937723393	1012613654368391168	1012618108580843521	1012654751157248000	1013903987672846336	1019242940647071744	1019251807019823110	1019612072781516805	1022907234064379904	1067551251632545792	1068383685299372032	1069288998281986049	1069304468854910976",fake
politifact15534,http://www.thelifebuzz.com/nasa-announced-that-it-communicated-with-four-races-of-aliens/2/,NASA ANNOUNCED THAT IT COMMUNICATED WITH FOUR RACES OF ALIENS,"In the summer of 2015, during last yearâ€™s Burning Man, festival founder Larry Harvey told me that â€œblack folks donâ€™t like to camp as much as white folksâ€. That week, I interviewed about 30 black people and some other people of color at Burning Man (pretty much all the people of color I could find who would talk to me) about why they came to a festival that was so overwhelmingly white. According to the Black Rock City census, black people at Burning Man make up only about 1% of attendees. When I returned this year, there was a burning question on many peopleâ€™s minds: did I think there were more black people at Burning Man a year later? In a word: yes. But to qualify that: there still werenâ€™t nearly enough, and whiteness ran rampant. Itâ€™s funny. When I asked Harvey about the lack of diversity last year, he bluntly said â€œweâ€™re not going to set racial quotasâ€  â€”   and as an organization, Burning Man seems to be doing little creatively and systematically to address the lack of diversity. The funny thing is that you can see people go to the ends of the earth to address the Burning Man principle of â€œradical  â€ while doing almost nothing to address its principle of â€œradical inclusionâ€.  People say â€œwell anyone can go to Burning Manâ€ and anyone can try to buy tickets through the lottery. But itâ€™s really expensive, which segregates in one way, especially for people who havenâ€™t invested in all the camping infrastructure.  Also, Burning Man distributes tickets to theme camps outside of the lottery to give preference to groups with a history with the festival. This is understandable. But those camps are almost all overwhelmingly white. So except for a handful of camps, Burning Man invests in the presence of hundreds of majority white theme camps, who will distribute their tickets almost exclusively to white people. And unless Burning Man consciously interrupts this, the population will just repeat itself  â€”   like any other ongoing segregated population. It would take a sense of radical, not passive, inclusion.  My observations are anecdotal but not uncritical. In 2015, I was constantly looking out for black people, and kept seeing the same folks over and over again. This year, I saw new black faces all week. Sometimes when Iâ€™d talk to black Burners, Iâ€™d hear it was their first time, and theyâ€™d tell me theyâ€™d come because of our article. Also, several longtime black burners told me about their joy at seeing more black folks. At the same time, the camp I stayed in (Que Viva) was a racial and social justice camp, set up right next to the People of Color Camp. And people would come home to our camps after a day of exploring and say things like, â€œItâ€™s so white out there. â€ And it was! The whiteness could be exhausting  â€”   like when a white guy wandered in to look at our Black Lives Matter altar, only to lecture me about the black people in our camp likely not being authentic enough for his tastes.  True, sometimes youâ€™d hear drums or see feathers, and when youâ€™d get closer, youâ€™d see they were being utilized by people of color to reflect their cultures in beautiful ways. But more often, it would be clueless white people dancing around in headdresses or appropriating cultures in other tacky and offensive manners. But Iâ€™m just one person. I decided to ask some other POC burners whether they thought there was more color this year at the blindingly white Burning Man. Here are some of our answers, edited from conversations by phone, email, Facebook message and text. Though I donâ€™t have census statistics to back me up (yet) my educated guess is the numbers might increase slightly this year for African American attendance at Burning Man. Before I became a member of the Black Rock Census team two years ago, Iâ€™d chase down every black person I saw on Playa for my research. In the past, that was doable. This year I was exhausted even counting visually the black folks I saw. No way I could have kept up my hydration and chased down my potential research subjects. I think numbers have gone up. Nice trend! I feel like I saw more people of color at Burning Man this year than I have the past three years, but it still doesnâ€™t feel like a space that genuinely champions diversity. Camping with a group of predominantly POC folk made the rest of Burning Manâ€™s overwhelming whiteness even more glaring. That said, Burning Man is an experience that has been really joyful and transformative for me, and Iâ€™m excited to see more folks of color sharing in that. Is it wishful thinking or did I truly see more people of color at Burning Man this year? Bicycling from camp to camp, I said hi, hugged, kissed, gave dap and the      head nod to black Burners. It was like a racial relay race in the desert where we could pass glances back and forth, making a network of double consciousness across the city.  Our presence was a degree above tokenism but far, far, far below the tipping point that would revitalize Burning Man. It helped that there were two camps dedicated to melanin. Que Viva camp, a powerful social justice camp, and my People of Color camp, where POC came by to enjoy the knowing ways of shared references, winks above smiles, laughter after pulling off the scab of racism, dancing late into the night  â€”   until our skin was black as space, filled with stars. I walked away from my first burn in 2014 believing that Burning Man held great potential for people of color to explore, create and play. Three burns later, that belief became a conviction. Yet my experiences are not without context as this was also the first year I camped with Que Viva camp, which neighbored People of Color camp. Both camps, by virtue of their demographic composition and explicit social justice politics, language, and workshop and dialogue spaces, became black and brown oases for people of color and white allies seeking shelter from the heat and the disingenuously   and selectively apolitical culture of white liberalism and libertarianism. Sadly, 2016 was not without white people walking around with native headdresses and dreadlocks, wealthy    camps, or the proportionally dismal number of people of color Burning Man is known for. It was, however, where I had the rare opportunity to think, laugh, cry, play and create among people of color and white allies who are about creating a larger antiracist world where more of us can fit, a world that neither begins nor ends in Black Rock City. Thanks to the people and the content of the experiences we   2016 set a high bar for what a    and social justice â€”  centered burn can and should look like. It definitely felt like there were black people this year. When I saw a person of color, it wasnâ€™t as novel or as freakish as it usually is. I usually do a count of black people. In the past, my count was in the low 70s, and in a high year it was 105. This year, I think being with a pregnant lady, my brain was in baby mode and I didnâ€™t do the count. But I did feel like there were more black folks, and that folks were more comfortable.  I was a Black Rock Ranger this year [rangers are â€œparticipants who volunteer a portion of their time at Burning Man in service of the safety and   of the Burning Man community,â€ who often mediate in situations before law enforcement gets involved]. When I went to my ranger training, there was a moment with the woman who managed us. Sheâ€™s a black woman, and most of the people in training were people of color, and there was this instant camaraderie between us. She said, â€œWe want you to do great, because we want to have more people who look like us, particularly as we can occupy the space between the Burning Man community and law enforcement. â€ And I had this idea. In this past year, weâ€™ve seen all these negative interactions between people of color and law enforcement. Of course people of color would flock  â€”   not to a law enforcement place, but to be protectors of a community   â€¦     to say to ourselves, â€œWhat can I do to be someone standing in this space between this community and the outside world?â€ It was very healing.",486,410,"881938446583046144	881938531807109121	881940938897141760	881942105194725376	881943516502536194	882086718169636864	882116695602728963	882116718017097730	882146616479813633	882181003728494592	882188798720962560	882209985077358592	882213561824665600	882229924844752896	882248962631241729	882279605868081152	882287883855421440	882292265867034624	882330038414319616	882340736200462336	882408619911905281	882442972616433664	882580089925455872	882651553135562753	882720777392472065	882829833960644608	882941985669165056	882943490677768192	882945115307814912	883263307922190336	884026024673120256	884267151946895360	884363606644666368	884407547448438790	884437844982288384	884449466379534338	884496051205533696	884512866493014017	884836685409910784	885598472140972032	885706576115322880	885706590212440064	885712016912130048	886846632414851072	887106891272175617	889586639923810305	889593716893143040	889617417026105344	889926708572426241	891089380655366144	891802786723246080	905905328629456897	905905401677443072	905905416512700416	905993104272089088	906090514725969920	906103140960886784	906251398718910464	906341915112730624	906369935156412416	906641484170096640	906653236702179329	906787680096309248	906813643077058561	907079573824692224	907290760998944768	907297270986457088	907340652740046848	907435688756436992	907443622299267072	907494033928462337	907505078151663622	907718226427047936	907995355437875200	908047749219799040	908047788180688896	908212727897837569	908263301678718976	908674948343795712	908931814864982016	909080769825574914	909138284915208192	909138789754441730	909147881357168642	909214839217692672	909285791918022656	909401591672918016	909402333141925888	909650442371641344	909730692313092096	909782798025871360	909868409944510465	909871086862561280	909975373701509120	909975879098306561	910032629260603393	910126993546600448	910216824431759366	910274758037639173	910376004044169216	910415792163786752	910461357274918912	910614229907992576	910632792664559617	910664557621923840	910819217678663680	910831973496696832	910966532204908544	911005489504407555	911099108907130881	911155676768096256	911238502360272897	911287881091739648	911332493143371776	911385459879809024	911524609194938368	911834164755910656	911850718545489921	912035470128717824	912126422503657472	912272978976608257	912347740679553024	912558990743220224	912657762701549568	912710327241969664	912747947879751681	926901610143469570	927296916831969281	927333321247461377	927335887691767809	927447742628077569	927573780196708355	927581598114971648	927837875231739904	928896968646168576	928897023687962624	935161011967021056	936213010477191168	936580219988860929	936744496456495107	936862387591720960	936996091383476224	937160104536764416	937873193439760384	942873008875692033	942873114710552577	948178655821336577	948892190545252354	949035471111376897	949514240997675008	958121890777849863	958121929264844800	958137521224941568	958821661783945217	958834584115908610	967767909719269377	980859430844751874	991454622467350528	991456415247036416	991458007023267840	991476661261451264	991476804211785728	991528597793005569	993943910882955269	993943998942334976	994623048258146305	1009268318899965953	1009268402383400960	1010642304988827648	1010671319220973569	1010789934851133441	1011373119649599488	1011617324447739905	1017244918765346816	1017244924641796097	1017790628816740352	1018018162368016385	1020054024672903168	1020054084747964416	1021563137114431488	1027308809893629952	1030506848993067009	1044060933293846528	1070139446849351682	1070221704897675264	1072709523205443584	1073640835760168961",fake

So, we are a just little closer to knowing where the gameâ€™s greatest player stands at 34 as he starts to creak around the edges. The finish line remains a blur but is not so distant as it was even a few months ago. We will know soon enough if Federer can keep his phenomenal   run in slams going at Roland Garros, and he did his best in defeat in the third round of the Italian Open to blow the clouds away, if not with any great conviction. Federerâ€™s   sponsors would be disappointed if he pulls out of the French Open, and his millions of disciples would be devastated. But the man himself will make a decision stripped of commercial obligations and sentiment. He cannot afford to make a fool of himself in public after 18 years of mostly controlled excellence. His health and what remains of his aura come first. Perhaps that is why a disturbing mix of hope, doubt and mutual impatience filled the room when he looked out on a sea of faces who most probably resembled pall bearers rather than hacks on deadline. He knew we wanted a story and he knew we knew what the best headline would be. He wasnâ€™t going to make it easy for us. There were the expected articulate and measured replies, the   shots before the occasional   winner, as he explained away his     loss to the rising young Austrian Dominic Thiem and set out how, despite nursing a back problem and seriously lacking match practice, he may yet be practising at Roland Garros next week. Federer, who came desperately close to pulling out of this Italian Open minutes before his match against Alexander Zverev in the second round on Wednesday, said he felt â€œabout the same [as] yesterday, not worseâ€. Losing to Thiem did not worry him, he said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter how I played. Important is that I didnâ€™t have any setbacks. I have only played five matches in the last four months, so clearly I donâ€™t want to get overly excited about whatâ€™s ahead. â€œI thought I could really do a good result in Paris. Now the last couple of weeks [after pulling out in Madrid and losing to   Tsonga in the   in Monte Carlo] itâ€™s been more difficult. I see my chances as not great. But, if maybe in three, four days I can practice 100% . .. then I believe that something is possible again. â€œClearly the way Iâ€™m playing right now is never going to be enough for any good run in Paris I also wouldnâ€™t play this way. Iâ€™m still confident I will be fine somehow. â€œThis was an information tournament for me. Never a result tournament. I knew I wasnâ€™t good enough for any result here, so thatâ€™s why I hope you donâ€™t read into it so much  â€”   and I donâ€™t. I need to see this completely in isolation, and I cannot carry any luggage from here other than the positive information. It just needs to stay here, the results, what I couldnâ€™t do and how limited I was. I was far off. â€œIf I can play 100% again and move again correctly, my mindâ€™s in a good place. My game is there. Iâ€™m still almost beating Thiem, and beating Zverev with whatever I have. Iâ€™m surprising myself. â€ Now there are practical matters to attend to. â€œDo we stay in Rome, do we go to Paris, do we go back to Switzerland? Those are three options there. Should I rest, should I train, what can I do with physiotherapy? Iâ€™m so happy that I didnâ€™t get hurt again this week, that it was worth it that I played. I never had better   preparation, to be honest. Conditions were perfect. I practised on centre court every day for about two hours a day. â€ But the interrogation was becoming a chore: â€œIn a way, I still enjoyed myself today, because I just said: â€˜Who cares what I do at  ? Who cares what happens, really? â€™â€ Then he grew impatient. â€œYouâ€™re still, to some extent, disappointed, but OK, two minutes, and then get rid of the press, get rid of the doping test, and then I canâ€™t wait to have the meeting with the team and start relaxing and preparing for whatâ€™s to come. â€ Pressed about the nature of his back problem, Federer looked for the exit. He took a bead on the questioner and left with a sharp parting shot: â€œIâ€™m not going to go into specifics, honestly. Iâ€™m not in the mood for you guys to start debating about it because you donâ€™t know, and I wonâ€™t tell you everything, anyway. But itâ€™s definitely got something to do with the back. â€ All we can be certain of is Federer is not at all certain if he will play in Paris and, if he does, he has no idea how well or poorly he will play.

politifact14490,http://disaster.trendolizer.com/2017/08/breaking-news-prince-william-and-harry-donates-100-million-to-hurricane-harvey-victims.html,BREAKING NEWS: Prince William and Harry donates $100 million to Hurricane Harvey Victims,"The American diplomat tasked with leading the occupation of Iraq in 2003 has backed several key criticisms made by Britainâ€™s Chilcot inquiry despite a defiant response to its report from former president George W Bush and other Republicans. Writing in the Guardian, Paul Bremer  â€”   who administered the coalition provisional authority (CPA) in the months after the war  â€”   agreed that prewar planning by both US and UK governments was â€œinadequateâ€ and accused political leaders of ignoring internal warnings. â€œThe [Chilcot] commission noted that that â€˜bad tidingsâ€™ tended not to be heard in London,â€ he said. â€œThe same was true in Washington. Before the war, a few American military officers suggested the need for a substantial   military presence. They were not heard. â€ Bremer also sharply criticised the failure of western forces to prevent looting in Iraq after the invasion and unrealistic troop commitments made by political leaders in Washington and London. â€œAs David Richmond, one of the able British CPA colleagues, told the commission, the coalition â€˜never got on top of securityâ€™,â€ he added. â€œSo the coalition gave the impression to Iraqis that we were not serious in this most important goal of any government. No doubt this failure encouraged some members of what became the resistance. â€ The comments contrast with a defiant response from George W Bush, who was celebrating his 70th birthday by cycling with wounded veterans at his ranch in Texas when the   UK report by Sir John Chilcot was published on Wednesday. â€œDespite the intelligence failures and other mistakes he has acknowledged previously, President Bush continues to believe the whole world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power,â€ said a spokesman for the former president. â€œHe is deeply grateful for the service and sacrifice of American and coalition forces in the war on terror. And there was no stronger ally than the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister Tony Blair. â€ Prominent neoconservative commentators in Washington also pushed back at the reportâ€™s findings, agreeing with Blair that events in Iraq could have been worse without the invasion. â€œ  intervention offered Iraq a better future,â€ wrote the former Bush speechwriter David Frum after the report came out. â€œWhatever [the] Westâ€™s mistakes: sectarian war was a choice Iraqis made for themselves. â€ â€œ[There was] no   intervention in Syria: and it collapsed into sectarian war even more horrible than Iraqâ€™s,â€ he added.  Bremer also says he disagrees with Chilcot on the wider merits of invading Iraq, as well as criticism of the decision to remove senior Baâ€™ath party officials from government posts after the war. â€œI believe history will agree that it was the correct, if difficult, decision to remove Saddam,â€ he writes. â€œHad we not done so, today we would likely confront a nuclear armed Iraq facing off against a nuclear armed Iran. Bad as the unrest in the region is today, that would be worse. â€ Dave Wurmser, a former Middle East adviser to US   Dick Cheney, told the Guardian via email that blame for current terrorism in Iraq lay with Iran and Syria. â€œTodayâ€™s Isis is a descendent of the Ansar       movement, which emerged from the refugee camps of Nahr   in Lebanon. They came originally from  â€™s   but retreated through Syria to Lebanon after his death. All intelligence at the time suggested that Ansar al     had substantial support from the Syrian and Iranian regimes, both of which were trying to stoke sectarian conflict in Iraq to undermine our position. The current plague of Isis is a direct result of those   policies. â€  He added of the report: â€œThe estimates of hundreds of thousands of killed Iraqis by US or British troops is simply contemptible gibberish. As bad as it might have been, and much of the bad was a result of Iranian and Syrian actions, Iraq remains the only relatively free Arab state in the region with a government representative of the people. â€ The White House said it had not been able to fully read the report yet, but stressed its support for Barack Obamaâ€™s view of the Iraq war. â€œI donâ€™t know that anyone in the US government has had an opportunity to evaluate the entirety of the report,â€ said spokesman Josh Earnest. â€œThe presidentâ€™s longstanding opposition to the war in Iraq is well known . .. [He] has been dealing with the consequences of that fateful decision for the entirety of his presidency and future presidents will likely do the same. â€ But officials insisted the experience would not hurt future cooperation between Washington and London. â€œIt is important that the US learn the lessons from those past mistakes,â€ added Earnest. â€œBut what is also true is that the UK and US have a special relationship and the ability of our leaders to work together . .. has made our countries more prosperous and more safe and I expect that relationship will endure regardless of who is in power. â€ The report coincided with a separate announcement by Obama of    troop deployment in Afghanistan.",73,809,,fake

Who doesnâ€™t love camp? Nostalgic adults can now rejoice: itâ€™s not just for kids anymore. Adult camps are a booming business in the US as stressed adults head for the hills to unleash their inner child. On a hot but breezy Friday morning in June, it was easy to recognize fellow campers in midtown Manhattan. As most New Yorkers hurried to work, campers  â€”   clutching their pillows and sleeping bags  â€”   sported a sheepish smile. â€œAre you going to camp?â€ said one as we looked for the bus that would take us to Camp Bonfire in Pennsylvania. Camp Bonfire was started by Jacob Winterstein and Ben Camp last year and is held at Lake Owego camp for boys, where the two met as children. This year, about 170 people attended the campâ€™s second   session, paying between $449 and $499 each. With adults searching for new ways to achieve   balance and make friends, adult camps have become a   industry. This year, weeks before kids across the nation finished off the school year, adults got first dibs on cabins and campgrounds in the hopes of reliving some of their happy childhood memories. While there are many activities such as     canoeing, archery, rock climbing, kickball and so on, the campers are allowed to do whatever they like. The campâ€™s slogan, reiterated over and over during the weekend, is: â€œYouâ€™re a   adult. Do what you like. â€ â€œYou want to lay in a hammock and read a book for six hours? OK, but other people might glare at you,â€ said Winterstein, to laughter from the campers. The only thing you cannot do at Camp Bonfire is be on your phone. That is, unless you are in the designated technology area, which is located in a far corner of the campground in a space used for most of the year as the shooting range. Surprisingly few people took advantage of the tech zone, perhaps because we were encouraged to shame anyone using their phone outside the area by trilling our best   impression. Camp Bonfire started as a place to go with friends and friends of friends, but word has quickly spread beyond Philadelphia, where both Winterstein and Camp live. This year, campers came from as far as Houston, Nashville and Cleveland. â€œWe are trying to figure out if itâ€™s a fad or if itâ€™s something that will be around for a while, where people could come to for the next 30 years,â€ said Camp, noting that they are hoping to expand Camp Bonfire along the eastern seaboard. â€œWe want this to be a place thatâ€™s welcoming to people of all ages,â€ added Winterstein, pointing out that campers range in age from early 20s to  . â€œWe want this to be a camp that we can grow old into. â€ Adam Tishauer, founder and head camper of Camp No Counselors, appeared on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragonsâ€™ Den, in May in the hopes of raising funds to expand his camp. Serving the â€œsharksâ€ with sâ€™mores  â€”   a typical camp snack  â€”   Tishauer stood before them and asked for $300, 000 investment in exchange for 7. 5% of his business. At this camp, mornings start with bloody marys and mimosas. â€œPlay like a kid. Party like a grown up. All the camp classics but with a twist . .. an open bar,â€ according to Instagram and Facebook ads for the camp. Charging $478 per person, four camps grossed $160, 000 last year. This year, Camp No Counselors expanded to organize weekends in Boston, Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, San Francisco, Miami and more. At the time of Tishauerâ€™s pitch, the camp planned 11 weekend camps with 1, 800 people, whose average age was 30. It had grossed $730, 000 so far and was expected to reach $800, 000, with $165, 000 in profit. Tishauer wants to do 30 camps next year and projects profits will reach $800, 000. His valuation of his adult camp business is $4m. Despite noting that Camp No Counselors is a â€œbrilliant ideaâ€ and   business, no sharks bit. â€œIt sucks. Thereâ€™s a lot of insects. You get eaten alive,â€ said Kevin Oâ€™Leary, one of the sharks who used to be a camp counselor and described himself as â€œmasterful canoeistâ€.  â€œToday, I like a mint on my pillow when I go to bed. I donâ€™t want to be anywhere near a camp. I donâ€™t know why these people would do this,â€ he said. Another shark, Daymond John, pointed out that overnight activities with alcohol can be a liability. A New York Observer reporter who attended a weekend at Camp No Counselors this year reported on an impromptu   drinking game involving flipping cups. At Camp Throwback, another adult camp near Dayton, Ohio, or at Camp Bonfire, campers are more likely to break into song than start a   tournament. While there is no   open bar at Camp Bonfire, some cocktails and beers were available both evenings courtesy of Brooklyn Brewery. As anyone who has ever watched a movie about camp will know, there are often rivalries between camps.  â€œThey are doing their thing,â€ Camp said when asked about Camp No Counselors business model. â€œI wouldnâ€™t want to go to that camp. I want to go to this camp. â€  That seems to be the consensus among other campers as well. â€œWho wants to have a weekend free of drunk assholes?â€ Winterstein and Camp asked on Friday. All hands went up. Itâ€™s nice to be doing something that is â€œnot centered around alcoholâ€ said Karine Semple, 29, who pointed out that many weekend activities like going out and brunch include drinks. â€œWe live for the weekend. I love being outside with other people. â€ Semple, who works as a senior health analytics consultant, flew in all the way from Houston to attend the camp. Earlier this year, she made a list of things to do by herself before turning 30: go on a yoga retreat, travel to Europe, spend the weekend at an adult camp. Semple did not really â€œdoâ€ camps as a child. She lived in Scotland until she was 10, at which point her family moved to Texas.  â€œItâ€™s truly a camp experience in every way,â€ she said, noting that she had â€œnot been surrounded by such a diverse group of people in a long timeâ€. Leora, 41, skipped her college reunion to attend Camp Bonfire for a second time this year.  â€œItâ€™s nice to come back. You donâ€™t get nervous when you donâ€™t know anyone,â€ she said. This year, her many activities included freestyle rap session with Winterstein and archery. â€œI tried to do different things this year. I tried to push myself. I felt more empowered this time around. â€ While not as brave as she was when she was younger, Hattie Johnson, 25, tried out the high ropes  â€”   where other campers pull you up in the air and then let you swing over the trees.  â€œI went to camp as a kid and it was one of the best parts of my childhood and I wanted to experience that again,â€ said Johnson, who flew in from Nashville, where she works as a logistics analyst.  Another challenge she faced that weekend? Surviving without her phone.  â€œTelling time gets tricky,â€ she says laughing, pointing at her bare wrist. â€œAt the same time, it was nice to be disconnected and not worry about work. â€ One camper admitted to checking her phone late at night inside her cabin. Afraid that the glow of her phone would give her away despite the low brightness setting, she zipped herself completely inside her sleeping bag.  At Camp Throwback, phones are allowed and according to Brittany Gibbons, campâ€™s founder, most people use them in â€œreally light social settingsâ€. â€œThey are Instagramming pictures of where they are going or taking videos. Itâ€™s great advertisement on our end but its also lasting memories for them,â€ she said. â€œI havenâ€™t caught anybody working. â€ But Camp Bonfire wants to keep it   and its campers seem happy. Being without a phone â€œwas amazingâ€ says Semple, on the bus back to New York as the weekend came to an end.  â€œI have a few messages but none of them were urgent. Itâ€™s a good reminder that there are more instances when I do not need my phone,â€ she explained, noting that phones are often used as a crutch in social situations. â€œIf everyone around you is on the phone, you want to be on the phone, too.

If you want to know where black people stand in the United States, tune in to the BET awards. Just donâ€™t expect a polished,      evening of television. At most, maybe you can hope that DJ Quik might forget heâ€™s on basic cable and use the   or you might see Lilâ€™ Kim dressed like a mermaid. That last nightâ€™s show was unabashedly political  â€”   with a memorable acceptance speech by Greyâ€™s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams as its centerpiece  â€”   and struck the right tone of fear and loathing was fitting after a week and 12 months that have been perilous at best. The BET awards took a stand  â€”   for responsible gun legislation, against systemic racism, and for the lives of black people everywhere. It was a great show, unless it was doing literally anything else. You had to swim through missed cues, daft comedy sketches and awards that felt like they meant nothing, even to the winners. Plus, the dominance of advertisers was staggering. As inspiring as it was to watch black people speak up about the state of the world, it was equally as depressing to see how corporate the entire affair was. The below is my running commentary  â€”   a record of my decent into boredom. 5. 01pm: The BET awards are filmed live from the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Your hosts are   stars Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross. Are they opening with BeyoncÃ© performing Freedom? Bold choice. 5. 03pm: Thereâ€™s a large pool in the middle of the stage, which my wife tells me is part of BeyoncÃ©â€™s tour  . Well, now we know BeyoncÃ© doesnâ€™t actually walk on water. I can see very clearly that her feet are fully submerged. Like, how is anyone going to follow this? Why not have her go last to force people to stick around and watch the entire show? 5. 09pm: So, to follow BeyoncÃ© and Kendrick Lamar, Tracee Ellis Ross and Anthony Anderson do some Billy Crystal melody of popular   songs in the style of Hamilton and thereâ€™s not a joke in sight. I guess they all thought it would be enough to put them in silly costumes and sing modern songs. They were sorely mistaken. 5. 12pm: Congrats to everyone whoâ€™s ever wanted to see RB star Anthony Hamilton stroke a musket between his legs. The camera cuts to Birdman and DJ Khaled, who legitimately look unhappy to be there. 5. 15pm: The first of many cutaways to the crowd revealing a person texting rather than watching the show. Memo to anyone who ever attends one of these events and gets to sit in proximity to a camera: they are filming you. Assume they are always filming you. If you are making plans for the   wait until after the show. If you are sliding in some DMs, thatâ€™s even worse. There should be a firm â€œNo DM Slidingâ€ rule at the BET awards. Having never been, maybe there is and I just donâ€™t know. That would explain why JR Smith didnâ€™t attend this year. 5. 21pm: BiBi Bourelly performs in front of a giant Nissan ad. 5. 27pm: Best male   artist goes to Bryson Tiller. Tiller thanks his granny, which proves we are watching the BET awards. When was the last time a white artist thanked their grandmother for anything? 5. 29pm: Desiigner performs Panda. Instead of rapping, Desiigner does some rudimentary tricks with his microphone  â€”   throwing it in the air and catching it, flipping it in the air and catching it, and finally, moving it close to his mouth while pretending to rap. 5. 31pm: MC Lyte has to sit at some desk sponsored by Coke a mile away from the stage and announce the commercial breaks. Did I mention that everything on this show is sponsored? Even the bumpers before the actual commercials are sponsored. 5. 38pm: Wow. Surprise! Michael B Jordan didnâ€™t show up to the BET awards. Deon Cole says he was â€œtoo busy being knocked out somewhereâ€. Is that a reference to Creed or a diss? I know what it wasnâ€™t: a good joke. Dave Chappelle comes out wearing sunglasses to kick off the Prince tribute, classing up the joint for a second. 5. 40pm: The Roots, Erykah Badu and Bilal perform. Badu sings The Ballad of Dorothy Parker while half asleep. Bilal sings The Beautiful Ones, nailing the famous high notes at the end. Props to Bilalâ€™s struggle braids and 10 gallon bags under his eyes. 5. 55pm: Next is the Shine a Light advertisement . .. I mean award, presented by the US Air Force. Young black men, you too can be heroes if you just enlist in the military! Just saw two more guys texting in the front row. 5. 56pm: Was Kevin Hart not available to host this? Fat Joe, French Montana and Remy Ma perform their hit song, All the Way Up. They brought out some geishas and now I want to say something about cultural appropriation, but Iâ€™m going to bite my tongue. Maybe theyâ€™re not geishas since they also have swords? 6. 00pm: One of the guys in the cast of the upcoming BET New Edition biopic named Keith Powers is dressed like the villain from an episode of Miami Vice or a random   from Rick Jamesâ€™s posse. The real New Edition comes out and the cameras cut to Floyd Mayweather who looks completely bored. I think this was supposed to be a big moment, but Bobby Brown has pissed away literally all of his goodwill for obvious reasons. 6. 03pm: The physical BET award looks like a trophy you give to the winner of a child beauty pageant. Taraji P Henson gives an impassioned plea to black people to vote while accepting her award for best actress. 6. 12pm: Alicia Keys played the guitar in a red jacket surrounded by a bunch of synthesizers and random equipment. Thatâ€™s all I got for this one. The music sounds like she turned into a coffeehouse open mic act. I half expected DJ Khaled to stand up and say that, yes, order number 23  â€”   the almond butter croissant and the soy latte  â€”   is his. Then she tosses one of the synthesizers and throws up, like, westside or something. 6. 16pm: Snoopâ€™s new album is called   which is like Lemonade, but worse for you. Jermaine Dupri and Birdman join him to promote a BET show about music moguls. You think Lil Wayne will pop up in the season finale? 6. 27pm: Stevie Wonder and Tori Kelly perform Princeâ€™s Take Me With You. Iâ€™m so bored. Iâ€™m going to walk my dog. 7. 00pm: Iâ€™m back from walking my dog. A great Muhammad Ali tribute is introduced by Jamie Foxx and his daughter. Layla Ali comes out and makes me tear up. 7. 08pm: Maxwell was invited to perform some Prince music, too. I got a glimpse of Kardashian baby daddy Scott Disick during Nothing Compares 2 U chewing gum and looking for the nearest exit. Memo to white people: If you were GIFTED an invite to the BET awards, show some respect and pay attention. You might learn something useful, like how to nae nae or dab or something. Maxwell added some lyrics about Spotify to Nothing Compares 2 U. 7. 13pm: Tracee Ellis Ross mentioned the many uses of water on the stage tonight. Nevermind the very serious California drought. Make it rain! Anthony Anderson drank the pool water from BeyoncÃ©â€™s performance and said it â€œtastes like Lemonadeâ€. Theyâ€™re officially not trying to be clever. 7. 15pm: Debra Lee, president and CEO of BET comes out to call for gun control legislation, gives the humanitarian of the year award to Jesse Williams. I wonâ€™t quote the entire speech, but hereâ€™s a sample: â€œNow the thing is though, all of us in here getting money, that alone isnâ€™t going to stop this. All right? Now dedicating our lives to get money just to give it right back for someoneâ€™s brand on our body, when we spent centuries praying with brands on our bodies and now we pray to get paid for brands on our bodies. â€ 7. 31pm: The following segment is brought to you by the United States Air Force. 7. 32pm: Thereâ€™s a Cadillac on fire in the back of Futureâ€™s performance like heâ€™s in a bad Hype Williams video.

They go through to the fourth round at the expense of Leicester, who went two goals up courtesy of a Shinji Okazaki brace. Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta scored either side of the   interval to put Chelsea back in the game and Fabregas popped up in extra time to remind Antonio Conte just how good he is. ET28: Leonardo Ulloa goes down injured, gets treatment and wanders over to the sideline to wait for permission to come back on again. Truth be told, he looks like heâ€™d prefer referee Bobby Madley to order him to stay put.  ET27: With the closing stages of the game being played at a dawdle, Matic picks out Moses with a ball to the corner from deep. He crosses for Chalobah, who is offside.  ET26: Fabregas snatches at a Marcos Alonso cross from the left that was intended for Diego Costa. His rushed effort scorches high and wide, prompting Farbegas to wave a hand of apology in Costaâ€™s direction.  ET24: Andy King hacks a Cesc Fabregas   into the penalty area out for a  . I reckon heâ€™s the first Leicester player to have touched the ball in over two minutes of play.  ET22: The players on the pitch seem to have reached a sort of unofficial entente cordiale, with nobody really trying a leg any more. Leicester seem happy enough to let Chelsea have the ball, on the unspoken condition that their visitors donâ€™t score any more goals. ET19: David Luiz gets caught out of position again, lets Jamie Vardy get in behind him and is forced to shove the striker. He gets booked and Leicester win a   wide on the right. The ballâ€™s swung into the mixer, but sails out of play.  ET18: With their opponents down to 10 men, Chelseaâ€™s players look content to spray the ball around and keep possession letting it do the work while the 10 men of Leicester chase shadows.  ET16: Leicester get the second half of extra time started.  A   brace from Cesc Fabregas seems to have won the game for Chelsea against   Leicester, but thereâ€™s another 15 minutes to go for Leicester to try to claw their way back into the game. Stranger things have happened, but they look a beaten docket as far as this match is concerned. ET15: Weâ€™ll have one minute of added time in the first half of extra time that followed the added time at the end of the second half of normal time.  ET10: Chelsea attack down the right, with Azpilicueta trying to link up with Eden Hazard. Ben Chilwell intervenes to cut out the danger. Heâ€™s another youngster whoâ€™s impressed in Leicesterâ€™s side tonight. From Milton Keynes but a product of Leicesterâ€™s academy, he spent time out on loan at Huddersfield last season and has had a decent debut tonight. Having said that, heâ€™s just been booked and was perhaps lucky not to get a red card. Claudio has a word . ..  ET7: With Leicester down to 10 men, trailing by two goals and looking ahead to a lunchtime   at Old Trafford on Saturday, I reckon you could canvas every player on each team, both managers and all the supporters in the ground tonight and the vast majority would vote for referee Bobby Madley to stop this game now. Obviously itâ€™s not within his remit, but Leicesterâ€™s players have the air about them of men who know the jig is up. Chelsea are giving them the runaround in a big way. ET6: Zieler saves well from Matic, getting down low to his right to tip the ball around the pright for a corner. Chelsea take it short, but nothing comes of it. Fabregas does it again, scoring inside the fourth minute of extra time. He was waiting in an expanse of space in the Leicester penalty area to pounce on a poor punch from Zieler. His first touch was sublime and teed him up for his second: a rasping drive past the goalkeeper.  Grrrrr! Cesc Fabregas taunts those who didnâ€™t want extra time with a goal inside two minutes of the restart. It was a move of scintillating speed on the edge of the Leicester penalty area, which culminated with the Spaniard pouncing to blast home after sprinting on to a ball trapped on his behalf by Diego Costa. Leicesterâ€™s defenders were left completely bamboozled there.  ET1: Diego Costa gets the first half of extra time going.  Cesar Azpilicuetaâ€™s spectacular effort means the game finishes all square after 90 minutes, so weâ€™ll have extra time which Iâ€™m professionally obliged to pretend to be enthused about. Whoop! Whoop! Having gone into a   lead, Leicester are very much the underdogs, having been reduced to 10 men by the late dismissal of Marcin Wasilewski. Weâ€™ll have another 30 minutes of play, with penalties to follow when, inevitably, the deadlock remains unbroken.  90+4 min: Weâ€™re in the final minute of time added on, with the scores level between   Leicester and their visitors Chelsea. Extra time beckons. 90+3 min: Daniel Amartey allows Costa to give him the slip and the Chelsea substitute shoots wide of the near post from a narrow angle. 90 min: Leicester substitution: Daniel Amartey on for Demarai Gray. His first task is to defend a Chelsea corner, where the ball breaks kindly for Victor Moses on the fringe of the penalty area. Moses tries his luck, but pulls his shot wide of the left upright. If heâ€™d got his boot around that one, it would have been unstoppable. 89 min: Marcin Wasilewski gets his second yellow card for a silly challenge on Diego Costa, who he barged into. Needless to say, Costa made the most of it, but the booking was fair.  88 min: David Luiz steps up to take the   but puts it over the bar. Chelsea substitution: Eden Hazard on for Pedro. In other housekeeping: Nemanja Matic got booked for some indiscretion or other a few minutes ago. 87 min: Chelsea win a   just outside the Leicester box, a mite left of centre. Cue: David Luiz. 86 min: Jeff Schlupp blows a   chance to win the game for Leicester, stepping over a fine delivery into the box from Andy King, presumably labouring under the misapprehension that there was a player in a better position behind him. He could have shot there, standing all alone about eight or nine yards out.  84 min: Costa latches on to a long ball from David Luiz halfway inside the Leicester half and takes on three defenders. Using his strength on the ball, he eventually fashions a shot that brings a smart save out of Zieler, who is forced to save again from the Spain internationalâ€™s   effort. Good play from both men. This is very entertaining fare   both sides are going all out for the win here. Itâ€™s quite obvious that neither fancies extra time.  83 min: A   between Morgan and Wasilewski allows Diego Costa to dart between them and unleash a low diagonal shot from a tight angle. Zieler saves. Earlier, Jamie Vardy had threatened to wreak havoc in the Chelsea defence after David Luiz had once again misjudged the flight of the ball. 79 min: Chelsea substitution: Nathaniel Chalobah makes a long overdue debut for Chelsea, having represented England 98 times at various levels and made 97 appearances for various clubs while out on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough, Burnley, Reading and Napoli. And to think some people criticise Chelsea for not bringing young players through, eh? How dare they? Heâ€™s on for Micy Batshuayi. 77 min: Within seconds of coming on, Vardy wins a corner for his team by chasing down Asmir Begovic as the goalkeeper attempted to deal with a backpass and was forced to put the ball out of play.  76 min: Leicester make substitutions either side of the corner. Leonardo Ulloa is on for Shinji Okazaki, while Jamie Vardy replaces Ahmed Musa.  76 min: Andy King fluffs a great scoring chance from the ensuing corner with a poor header at the far post. He should have scored.  74 min: Chance! Ahmed Musa misses a glorious chance to put Leicester ahead. His chance came from a David Luiz error, with the Brazilian hopelessly misjudging the flight of a long ball from the back, allowing Musa to dart in behind him. He deftly tries to lift the ball over the onrushing Begovic, but the goalkeeper got a fingertip to the ball and managed to divert it wide of the upright. Great goalkeeping or a terrible miss? Itâ€™s difficult to tell. Perhaps a combination of both.  74 min: Costa picks out Victor Moses on the right wing and he sends the ball into the mixer. Leicester clear.  73 min: The camera cuts to the Leicester bench, where Jamie Vardy looks eager to get involved. For the time being, his manager is keeping his powder dry.  70 min: Victor Moses cuts in from the right touchline and overcooks a cross, sending Pedro scampering towards the far touchline in a bid to keep the ball in play. He does so but Chgelsea are unable to capitalise on his industry.  69 min: Chance! Having just come on, Diego Costa gets in behind two   Leicester defenders to pounce on a ball from deep and slot a diagonal shot wide of the far post when scoring looked easier. He looks disgusted with himself and well he might. That was a hideous miss for an   striker. He beat Zieler, but couldnâ€™t steer his effort inside the far post. Shocking defending from Leicester, it should be noted.  68 min: Chance!   Zieler saves brilliantly from Michy Batshuayi, stretching every sinew to claw away a long range effort after the Belgian turned and shot from the edge of the penalty area.  67 min: Antonio Conte is the first of the two managers to sound the Big Gun klaxon. Chelsea substitution: Diego Costa on for Ruben  . 64 min: SIgns of activity on the Leicester City bench, where Jamie Vardy is warming up. Leicester have a lunchtime appointment at Old Trafford on Saturday, so Claudio Ranieri is unlikely to risk any of his big guns unless he feels itâ€™s absolutely necessary. He ceertainly wonâ€™t want extra time and penalties here. 61 min: Pedro and Danny Simpson have a frank exchange of views that ends with both men all smiles, as the latter accuses the former of throwing himself to the ground in a bid to gull the referee.  59 min: Cesc Fabregas attempts to pick out Michy Batshuayi with a ball from deep. The Chelsea striker had got between the two central defenders, but Fabregasâ€™s searching ball zipped off the turf and straight into the arms of   Zieler in the Leicester goal. 58 min: Demarai Gray goes to ground in the Chelsea penalty area under a â€œchallenge from Azpilicueta after being teed up by a good ball from the left by Andy King. Referee Bobby Madley is having none of it and replays show that Gray kicked his leg in the direction of the goalscorer before throwing himself theatrically to the ground.  . 56 min: Ahmed Musaâ€™s been impressive for Leicester tonight, leading the line well and proving a more than capable   merchant. He concedes a cheap   here, barging Gary Cahill out of play when there was no need to cede possession so cheaply.  55 min: Leicester break on a   with Okazaki on the ball as he gallops up the centre. He attempts to thread a pass between two defenders and pick out Ahmed Musaâ€™s run. Gary Cahill reads his intentions and blocks.  54 min: Okazaki wins a   halfway inside his own half after an   challenge from Pedro. Leicester clear their lines, with Andy King pumping the ball up the field.  53 min: Marcin Wasilewski is booked for some indiscretion or other. Thatâ€™s the first caution of whatâ€™s been a fairly violence free encounter.  51 min: Thatâ€™s Azpilicuetaâ€™s fourth goal for Chelsea and his first since January, but it was an absolute beauty. Standing a couple of yards outside the Leicester penalty area, he caught a headed clearance perfectly and the ball flew into the top corner. Oof! Azpilicueta scores with the sweetest of   volleys from the edge of the penalty area, leaving Zieler standing flatfooted and gazing in admiration. It all stemmed from that Leicester corner, from which Chelsea broke up the field. Thatâ€™s a sensational equaliser from the  . 48 min: Leicester win a   on the halfway line, which is lumped long. Chilwell wins the header on the left side of the Chelsea penalty area and the ball breaks for Schlupp. He shoots through the legs of Cahill and wins a corner. 46 min: Chelsea have a shot almost straight from the   with Cesc Fabregas trying his luck from 25 yards after being teed up by Azpilicueta. Zieler saves comfortably, with the ball at chest height. There are no changes on either side. The teams may be far from full strength, but itâ€™s been an entertaining half of football nonetheless. Shinji Okazaki took advantage of some slapstick defending to give Leicester a   lead, but Gary Cahill made amends of a sort with a goal deep in first half injury time that keeps his side in the game. Expect both managers to be fuming, but the crowd will be happy enough with what theyâ€™ve seen so far.  Chelsea win a corner, which Fabregas swings in from the right. Having given Wes Morgan the slip, Gary Cahill scores with a powerful header from deep that crept in at the near post. 45 min: Moses and   are showing signs of life down the right flank and they combine to good effect again as the latter attempts to tee up Batshuayi. Marcin Wasilewski stays tight on the striker to prevent him getting a shot off.  43 min: Good pressure from Chelsea, as a Ruben   cross from the right is allowed run through to Pedro, who returns it with interest. Wes Morgan allows the ball to run under his foot and is lucky there are no Chelsea players on hand to blast the ball goalwards. Thatâ€™s the first sign of disarray weâ€™ve seen in the Leicester City ranks, compared to the default state of disarray in which Chelseaâ€™s defenders appear to have found themselves.",387,855,"892289151453855745	892479920382857216	892543907086688262	892591452051714048	892597728949149696	892626194256023552	892626412640849920	892642744740466689	892716484459286529	892723978422423554	892732321559982081	892770519363325952	892826408988401664	892833978444644352	892868035698196480	892872223442292738	892908991935860736	892939550686838785	892941983181832192	893001767369232385	893081658240491520	893156640236732417	893264265062137856	893350639828422656	893354085902143488	893415488449110016	893458247935459328	893502745675739137	893513745108000768	893514561986469888	893566644953399296	893568099722702848	893583767012425728	893589013432610816	893602834104692736	893616539219279872	893628415877709824	893629392546668544	893630943113687040	893634904935645185	893639913211645952	893642182661468160	893645048386117632	893676439475769344	893716584493182976	893773728999505921	893818028311420928	893830367425253376	893832799312121856	893833145132437505	893835151498768384	893846177027903488	893854704161239042	893855827983028224	893857501455757314	893905807888207872	893912034085044224	893919129996066816	893930602168274944	893941768781156352	893986200087707648	893987008241991681	894233920492974080	894339766233071616	894417648804483073	894439413496909826	894670492451385344	894792116051771392	894792134859128832	894910888322506752	895024471073058817	895301510132899841	895459442598191104	895681247200112640	896093246626996226	896153625541484544	896235790140936192	896394048726028289	900427245818441730	900713924433260546	900772330955313154	900773507579207680	900773589045182464	900775295040598016	900775498715975680	900781073466085378	900781214877003778	900788407139487744	900810865594814464	900823528060145664	900831146556219393	900831241573998593	900840556632432645	900869838280773633	900878489733144576	900879560404848640	900882868070690816	900897270593462277	900904108189790208	900935483890442241	901013553708224512	901089948199268352	901132991425990656	901135640909160448	901147237631238144	901154407806636033	901154530653614080	901178262637879297	901259625043042304	901262100550615041	901270652895744001	901274974421495809	901302666554376192	901302733768142848	901432638623416321	901451022945492997	901476876077498368	901537615941423104	901575511025098752	901617078263742465	901632469832679424	901661404511522816	901684706160377856	901720433854103553	901803326286823424	901880870121816064	901881328534216705	901925427064786944	901992884324401152	902684986188460032	903082198584229889	904645202521989120	906017711351783424	907669283383201792	907797393051193344	907799723431518208	907805444621705221	907813042796290048	907848570216345600	908123990417448960	908127581421096965	908281553687588864	908334349556129792	920112053951586304	920783475644407808	937887387279015936	938127060245073923	958562676694712320	963589739650707456	963592988596297729	963593031302680578",fake
politifact13973,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html?_r=0,Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: ‘This Is All About Income’,"Fifty years ago tomorrow, at 6:13pm, a unique moment in television history took place. A camera closed in on the face of an actor lying motionless on the floor. The image blurred, faded to white, then came back into focus, revealing that for the very first time, Doctor Who had changed his face. It was the stroke of genius that saved the series from being a three or four season wonder, and instead ensured it would go on to become one of the UKâ€™s most iconic pieces of popular culture. Switching the lead from William Hartnell to Patrick Troughton was an audacious move, brought about because of falling ratings, plus Hartnellâ€™s   and attitude. And whereas the announcement of a new Doctor in the   merits a live TV unveiling with accompanying liveblog, in 1966 the Manchester Guardian noted that the childrensâ€™ television show was changing its lead in the same    column that announced who had won Miss Blackpool. Troughton arguably had the hardest job of any actor in the role  â€”   namely to convince the public he was the same person they had been following since 1963. In his first episode, the brief dialogue trying to explain what had happened was aimed as much at the audience as at his companions, Ben and Polly, in the TARDIS. Interviewed in 1986 for Fantasy Empire by John Peel, Troughton said: â€œI didnâ€™t think it was a particularly good idea of the BBC to replace Billy. I thought it was pretty silly, really. I thought that the difficulties of selling it to the audience were enormous   â€¦     almost insurmountable. However, in the end, I was persuaded over a week of negotiations, and I thought, â€˜What the heck, letâ€™s do this for a while and see what happensâ€™. â€ Troughtonâ€™s first story as the Doctor  â€”   The Power of the Daleks  â€”   is lost, but will soon be issued by the BBC in animated format. He went on to play the Doctor until 1969, then reprise the role during the 80s in The Five Doctors alongside Jon Pertwee and Peter Davison, and The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. When Hartnell turned into Troughton, the show had very little  . Doctor Who was not even yet a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey his origins were still a mystery. Even when Hartnell was shown facing one of his own people for the first time (the Meddling Monk) details of their home world were entirely absent. One can only imagine how surprising the reveal was in 1965 that somebody else even had a TARDIS. We now exist in an era where   can be effectively rebooted three times at the movies in the space of 15 years, but when Doctor Who did this, it was very much uncharted territory. Up to this point, most changes of actor had either been simply ignored   or been done by hastily bringing in new characters to cover for an absence. And few other series have made such a radical recasting of the lead an intrinsic part of its formula. Take Star Trek, a similarly   fantasy franchise. After its original run, both the 70s animated series and the initial batch of motion pictures relied on the same actors and characters. It wasnâ€™t until over 20 years after the first episode aired that they dared replace William Shatner with a new captain of the Enterprise. No such luck for Hartnell, who got three years as Doctor Who  â€”   and remains the only actor to take the role who didnâ€™t realise that he would one day be replaced. As well as â€œthe renewalâ€ (the term regeneration was not used at the time) Hartnellâ€™s final story also introduced another enduring part of the Doctor Who universe: the Cybermen. The creatures depicted in The Tenth Planet are more obviously human than later designs (and DVD remastering shows how much the monsters from Mondas relied on Sellotape to stop them from falling apart). Still, the costume designs are chilling. The stretched cloth across the face, and the hollow eyes, give a clearer indication of   humans than the later faceplates. But this was actually a   exercise: their faces were hidden so the same handful of extras could play different groups of the space invaders across all of the episodes. Hartnell was too ill to shoot part three of the story, the week before he was due to leave the show  â€”   so it was hastily rewritten to install an incapacitated body double in a bunk bed. And, since the last episode is missing from the BBCâ€™s archives, there are only fleeting glimpses of his Doctorâ€™s end. Itâ€™s hard to judge whether his erratic performance in those final scenes are as intended by the director, or a product of his health. There is a recently discovered clip of him being interviewed while getting ready to do a pantomime performance three months after his departure. Asked whether he would â€œshake offâ€ being Doctor Who, Hartnell was bullish: â€œOh yes. By making a success in something else, why not?â€ But it wasnâ€™t to be. Hartnellâ€™s career essentially ended with that regeneration scene. He featured briefly in early 70s story The Three Doctors, and thereâ€™s also a wonderfully bizarre cameo from him, which has turned up on YouTube, in a Cliff Richard musical from the late 60s which retells the parable of the prodigal son. (Hartnell improbably plays a shop owner who is Sir Cliffâ€™s father.) Hartnell never did shake off playing the Doctor. But, as Doctor Who heads into its sixth decade, itâ€™s clear that the decision to shake him off meant everything.  The essential premise of Doctor Who  â€”   a traveller in a blue box who can go anywhere in time and space, putting wrongs to right with the power of intellect rather than force  â€”   now falls in the same category as Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, Miss Marple or Robin Hood: characters that we know well, and that have an endless capacity for renewal. People continued to want to tell tales of the Time Lord when the show was largely   between 1989 and 2005, whether as comics, novels, audio dramas or webcasts.

politifact15409,https://yournewswire.com/cnn-ratings-plunge-30-percent/,CNN To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent,"Journalist Megyn Kelly, who is under armed guard after receiving death threats, has accused Donald Trumpâ€™s social media director of stirring hatred on the internet. The Fox News host urged Dan Scavino, a member of the presidential transition teamâ€™s leadership staff, to stop encouraging hostile and abusive elements online. â€œThe vast majority of Donald Trump supporters are not at all this way,â€ Kelly told an audience in Washington. â€œItâ€™s that far corner of the internet that really enjoys nastiness and threats and unfortunately there is a man who works for Donald Trump whose job it is to stir these people up and that man needs to stop doing that. His name is Dan Scavino. â€ Scavino was director of social media for Trumpâ€™s bitterly divisive election campaign. He is devoutly loyal to the billionaire businessman who reportedly first spotted him as a    cleaning golf clubs, got him to caddie and eventually promoted him to general manager at one of his courses. Now in his 40s, Scavino has speculated that he might become the White House photographer or run its Twitter account. He and Kelly have clashed in public before. In October, after a heated exchange between the presenter and Trump ally Newt Gingrich, Scavino issued an ominous tweet: â€œMegyn Kelly made a total fool out of herself tonight  â€”   attacking Donald Trump. Watch what happens to her after this election is over. â€ Scavino did not reply to a request for comment from the Guardian. Members of the audience at Mondayâ€™s nightâ€™s event, organised by the Politics and Prose bookshop, were required to undergo body and bag searches by security staff. Kelly said: â€œThe worst part is the security threats that Iâ€™ve had to face and, as much as I try to avoid some of that online vitriol, I get lots of it and I really hate it. I find that stuff just  . â€ The journalist has had an up and down history with Trump. She recalled that she had been â€œfriendlyâ€ with the New York property tycoon until August last year when she aired allegations about his divorce from Ivana Trump. She said Trump raged at her over the phone, quoting him as saying: â€œYouâ€™re a disgrace! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Youâ€™re a disgrace! I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account against you and I still may. â€ A few days later, as a moderator at the first Republican primary debate, Kelly asked Trump about past comments he had made disparaging women. He subsequently launched a social media blitz against her, branding her â€œoverratedâ€ â€œangryâ€ â€œcrazyâ€ and â€œa bimboâ€. In an interview, he later implied that she had been hostile to him because she was menstruating, saying she â€œhad blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her whereverâ€. Kelly described it as â€œan attempt at bullyingâ€ that failed, thanks to the support of her team at The Kelly File. â€œIt was hard to hold the line night after night after night and not cover him too harshly, because my life was being threatened, and not cover him too gently, because I wanted him to stop the nonsense or to please him. â€ She received death threats and obscene phone calls, she continued. â€œWhen Donald Trump comes after you, it isnâ€™t just a tweet  â€”   â€˜oh wow, heâ€™s tweeting about herâ€™ and I understand heâ€™s a fighter, heâ€™s a   I get all that  â€”   but even then he has such power that a single tweet can unleash hell in somebodyâ€™s life. â€œIâ€™ve been under armed guard for 16 months and my children have been under armed guard and itâ€™s not an appropriate price to pay for   journalism. â€ Kellyâ€™s new memoir, Settle for More, has received particular attention for its account of Roger Ailes, the longtime chairperson of Fox News, who was forced to resign in July over allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Kelly writes that, in 2006, Ailes made numerous sexual comments to her and tried to grab her and kiss her on the lips. She has since done numerous â€œannoyingâ€ interviews, she said, in which she is challenged over why she did not speak out against Ailes sooner. â€œItâ€™s like, why didnâ€™t you come forward earlier? And itâ€™s like, you know what, can I swear here? Fuck you for saying that!â€ Ailes, she recalled, was a mentor and often a positive influence on her career, but also made â€œhighly inappropriate sexual referencesâ€ which she tried to shrug off. â€œIn the book I could have filled four pages with the comments he made. I didnâ€™t want to go there. I included enough so you can decide for yourself whether it was sexual harassment. I submit to you that it was unambiguous. â€ Kelly described a â€œterrifyingâ€ six months in which she understood that her career at the conservative cable news network was on the line. She claims that eventually, Ailes made a physical advance in his office. â€œIâ€™d been with the company for 18 months by that point: Iâ€™m not the Megyn Kelly of today, I have no power, I mean zero, and he was on the cover of industry magazines as the most powerful man in news. â€œAs soon as we had that physical confrontation in his office and I did not do anything, I ran out of his office, I hired a lawyer and, for the record, I did tell a supervisor, which is what you are supposed to do. â€ But years went by and Ailes remained unassailable. â€œI had convinced myself, based on what my supervisor had told me, that heâ€™s not a bad man, heâ€™s just smitten, he might be having a marital difficulty. â€ Then the anchor Gretchen Carlson went public with an accusation of harassment against Ailes. Kelly, sensing that he would seek to shut down the investigation, decided to come forward. â€œHonestly, I just said, this will not happen to one more woman at Fox News ever. â€œI told them the good and the bad about my relationship with him. I didnâ€™t want them to think he was some monster. I just wanted them to know this is real and you need to take an honest look into his behaviour. Thatâ€™s all I wanted, just an honest review. I figured if there was nothing there, they would exonerate him, and if he went down, he would only have himself to blame. And I believe thatâ€™s where things wound up. â€ Several other women broke their silence to accuse Ailes, leading to his resignation. Kelly condemned observers who have sought to blame the victims. â€œTo the haters who look at those of us with our false eyelashes and our cute little dresses and say, like, â€˜You asked for it,â€™ again, fuck you for saying that. Itâ€™s nothing to do with how we dress. â€ During the election race, according to Kelly, Ailes was in daily contact with Trump, whose similarly faced allegations of sexual assault, harassment or unwanted advances from a dozen women, threatening to derail his campaign.

I finally figured it out last week. I was at the final show of Beyonceâ€™s Formation World Tour, at the Meadowlands. The openers alone were amazing  â€”   DJ Khaled brought out Mase, Remy Ma, DMX and Fetty Wap, among others. But then, in a spectacular show in which Beyonce would eventually bring out   on Drunk in Love and Kendrick Lamar on Freedom, she gave us a truly unexpected gift when she performed Sorry. From beneath the stage, perched on a throne, emerged Serena Williams. And she was there to dance.   thousand people lost their damn minds. I can now say that for some folks the return of Gilmore Girls is roughly equivalent to the level of happiness in that stadium when Serena was twerking. I donâ€™t share the enthusiasm for the return of the denizens of Stars Hollow. I watched perhaps five complete episodes during the original run, and saw bits and pieces of other episodes when friends were watching. Otherwise, I avoided it. Look, Gilmore Girls is a   and very funny show with an extraordinarily gifted cast. But itâ€™s also the tale of a narcissistic mother who never grew out of her teens, and her precocious daughter who regularly performs emotional labor in the service of literally every other character on the program. And thatâ€™s my problem with Gilmore Girls: the heart of the show rests on the idea that Rory and Lorelai have a healthy relationship.  They donâ€™t. Every episode seems to be predicated on Rory dragging these other people up the damn mountain on a sleigh, rope in her teeth, eyes squinting against the sunlight. Meanwhile, Lorelaiâ€™s having feelings about The Hot Man From The Diner (feelings I actually understand, because The Hot Man From The Diner is very hot, indeed). I think part of the appeal of the show for its wide teen audience was that Rory very clearly had a greater deal of maturity than her gorgeous, funny mom. Every kid wants to think they know better than their parents. My masterâ€™s degree is in teaching grades 7 through 12, and some of my students were indeed insightful, warm and mature in the face of their own parentsâ€™ ignorance and toxic narcissism. I counted as fortunate the kids who were demonstrably less mature than their parents. That is the order of things, and how, ideally, it should be. It ainâ€™t cute when mom is still trying to be a kid herself (hence, of course, the accurate title â€œGilmore Girlsâ€). My quibble is not with the writing, and it is certainly not with the wonderful performers. This is a murderersâ€™ row of excellence in acting, which is why Iâ€™d like to take the whole damn cast and write them a more enjoyable show. Consider this essay, then, a pitch for a show that takes the entire cast of Gilmore Girls and, instead of rebooting the same old thing, places them instead in the Wild West. In Oâ€™Malley Broads, Lauren Graham plays a sassy saloon mistress, Maggie Oâ€™Malley. Her sister Peggy Oâ€™Malley (Melissa McCarthy) is a badass, sexy gunslinger with a heart of gold. The Hot Man From The Diner plays The Hot Man From The Cobblerâ€™s Shop And Also He Is The Cobbler, and heâ€™s super into Peggy. She uses him for sex and efficient shoe repair, but her one true love is one of the guys Rory dates in the original Gilmore Girls (theyâ€™re pretty interchangeable). I would like Alexis Bledel to play a villainous governess named Mabel Sanseberry. She is not one of the Oâ€™Malley Broads, which will confuse some Gilmore Girls fans, but theyâ€™ll adapt because Bledel has range. The spectacular Kelly Bishop, who plays Grandmother Gilmore, will be Tickles Barnaby, a successful brothel madame who seduces The Sheriff, played by a bearded Matthew McConaughey (I donâ€™t know why heâ€™s in this. He just is). I would also like the fantastic and dearly departed Edward Herrmann, Grandfather Gilmore, to be alive and to play whatever the hell he wants. That manâ€™s capacity for conveying anger mixed with deep compassion was astounding.  Doesnâ€™t that sound better than Gilmore Girls? Of course it does! Everybody gets to chew scenery, no oneâ€™s doing undue emotional labor, Lauren Graham probably wears a great   saloon lady dress, no one is stressing out over the love or approval of a man and everyone acts like an adult. Also, Lauren Grahamâ€™s love interest will be played by Gwendoline Christie, aka Brienne of Tarth on Game of Thrones (sheâ€™s a gunslinger named Sparks Mactaggart.) Now the show is   too! Anyway. Iâ€™m just the grumpy old gal in the corner, on the eve of turning 36, grousing about a show that other people love. So go on and love your show, Gilmore People. Make your memes. Itâ€™s nice that Rory loved books. Iâ€™m an author and I hope you love books too. Just, seriously, somebody fund Oâ€™Malley Broads. I swear itâ€™s going to be so much better.",723,108,"906780480317673472	908871532457418752	969781970036240384	969784071382552576	973404111101075456",fake
politifact15123,https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm598317.htm,"Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDA’s ongoing efforts to help improve effectiveness of influenza vaccines","Last Wednesday the Russian Olympic Committee named a provisional team of 386 athletes for the Rio Games. It was, for a few hours, a triumph of hope over expectation. Then realpolitik bit hard. The next day, that figure was scythed by 68 when the court of arbitration for sport upheld the ban on Russiaâ€™s track and field stars competing in the Olympics. Come Sunday afternoon it could be slashed even further  â€”   possibly to a handful of athletes. At midday (BST) the International Olympics Committeeâ€™s executive board will discuss what to do next with Russia. By 3pm a statement is expected to announce either a blanket ban or that each individual Olympic sports federation has the power to separately exclude Russian athletes from their competitions. Whichever way the IOC goes, there will be anger. The stakes are high. Not just for Russia, but for the Olympic movement itself. On Saturday night the IOC appeared to be moving closer to the position of track and fieldâ€™s governing body, the IAAF, which refused to allow Russian athletes to go to Rio unless they could prove they were part of a comprehensive and compliant   programme. It recently gave clearance to just two Russian athletes  â€”   Darya Klishina, who trains in Miami, and the whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova  â€”   to go to the Games. Yet some fear delegating the decision to the individual federations could lead to huge inconsistencies. Some organisations, such as the International Weightlifting Federation, would be likely to ban Russian athletes wholesale because of the huge numbers of positive tests in that sport. Others, like judo, appear inclined to let as many as possible into Rio. As Marius Vizer, the president of the International Judo Federation, explained last week: â€œThe presence of Russian athletes is very important, as the Russian Judo Federation is a prominent member of the International Judo Federation, with Russian judo playing a great role in the history of sport. â€ As a result, many   groups want Wada and the IOC to make the decision over which athletes are allowed  â€”   not the federations. Last week 14 such organisations, including the United States   Agency, wrote to the IOC president, Thomas Bach, asking him to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee and ban all Russian athletes from the Olympics  â€”   but to allow them to compete under a neutral flag if a taskforce, approved by the IOC and Wada, verified they were clean. They believe this will strike a fair balance between collective responsibility and individual justice â€œso that no truly clean elite Russian athlete is barred from the Olympic Gamesâ€. That, as the World   Agency president, Craig Reedie, neatly explained on Saturday, is the backdrop to the decision, before making clear where his instincts lay. â€œYou cannot simply assume across all 28 summer sports the state of play is the same  â€”   and that gymnasts, for example, are in same situation as track and field or a swimmer. â€ Others passionately disagree. Those arguing for a blanket ban believe it is the only punishment suitable for the gravity of Russiaâ€™s crimes, which have been laid bare by a series of reports finding â€œ  dopingâ€ from Wada, most recently by the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren. As the British IOC member, Adam Pengilly, puts it: â€œThe scale, coordination and leadership of a doping system like this is arguably the most heinous crime possible against the Olympic movement. So, somewhat reluctantly, I am led to one conclusion: exclusion from Rio. I say reluctantly because there are very probably clean Russian athletes, and they will suffer, and this is nothing short of terrible. Thereâ€™s no fair outcome for everyone, but the Russian flag should not be flown at the Rio Games. â€ That view that Russia should be banned is shared by Richard Ings, the former head of the Australian   Agency, but from a different perspective. â€œRussia was a host of a Winter Olympics yet ran a fraudulent doping programme to cheat other athletes for the benefit of Russians,â€ he said. â€œThey canâ€™t be allowed to get away with that. Ethically, what needs to happen is very simple, but politically it is very complicated. Many of those friendships between IOC blazers at cocktail parties will be blown up. â€ However, Ings also blames Wada for not doing more earlier, to give individual Russian athletes the chance to show they were clean. â€œIt was all avoidable. Everyone knew there were serious problems with Russia in 2013  â€”   yet Wada did nothing until nearly 18 months later. If this had been investigated immediately, then the Russians could be given a clear ultimatum detailing what they needed to do to qualify for the Olympics. â€œBut if you are saying Russian athletes canâ€™t go because of not satisfactory testing, then shouldnâ€™t that apply to other countries?â€ he adds. â€œMy view is you have a performance qualifying standard to qualify for the Olympics, then there should be   standard as well. Every athlete should have a full and regular blood and urine screen  â€”   and if you havenâ€™t met that standard you donâ€™t go. â€",892,381,"968180418917871617	968182653001306114	968182901853503488	968182932358729729	968184025411026949	968184039348756480	968184332471980032	968184470841917441	968185802562797568	968186751431802881	968193159460196353	968197571834535936	968202313591611392	968215475078414336	968215479536959488	968216564746084352	968216642592309248	968260349127376896	968260421680443392	968282493911814145	968288339571834881	968434570684174336	968485081261248512	968506900915675136	968943593976205312	969738886065745921	969793740473806848",fake

I just want to know if there is something we could do thatâ€™s just not really presidential, really  â€”   can I mess your hair up?â€ Trump let him and the NBC audience roared with laughter. But, for many of us, this is very far from being a joke. Giving comic cover to Trump just isnâ€™t funny when heâ€™s unleashed forces of   and   sentiment. Heâ€™s labelled Mexicans rapists, raised the prospect of a ban on Muslims, patronized and insulted African Americans while pretending to be a potential new hope. As a result, Fallon managed to come over as one powerful white man protecting another. Not only was it not funny. It didnâ€™t do anything to take Trump down a notch (if it was even meant to). Instead, it humanized him, boosting him on that stupid metric so many Americans use when choosing a president: â€œHey, heâ€™s a guy Iâ€™d want to have a beer with! Look at him, letting Fallon have fun with him!â€ Fallon had real power last night and squandered it. I canâ€™t imagine Chelsea Handler, Trevor Noah or the recently departed Larry Wilmore building up Trump like that.  By smoothing over Trumpâ€™s hatefulness with comedy, he allowed the Republican candidateâ€™s supporters to say â€œHey, canâ€™t you all take a joke? !â€ I have been highly critical of Hillary Clinton, but the misogyny directed at her by his supporters, who sell â€œTrump That Bitch!â€ shirts and who scream â€œlock her up!â€ is terrifying and wrong. Trump was handed a chance to change the story on a day when his   views on President Obamaâ€™s nationality were back on the agenda. The routine smoothed the way for Trump to say he now believes Obama was born in the US, dashing off before answering any questions about his long espousal of birtherism  â€”   which he now blames on Clinton.  Jimmy Fallon, youâ€™ve given permission for all of this to be chalked up as one big joke. The writer Sarah Schulman recently asked whether it was â€œthe TV entertainment class that has sold out this country to Donald Trumpâ€. CBS president Les Moonves basically admitted as much when he said Trumpism â€œmay not be good for America, but itâ€™s damn good for CBSâ€. Now, NBC seems to concur. In January of 2015, NBC admirably cut ties with Trump on the Apprentice and Miss Universe when he called Mexicans rapists. But like most corporations, when they saw how much power he wielded  â€”   that he could wind up in the Oval Office  â€”   it wanted access. And so last fall they let Trump host Saturday Night Live, Fallonâ€™s old stomping ground, before allowing him to engage in good humored chat with Fallon last night. We see you, Jimmy Fallon. You are as â€œapoliticalâ€ as the wretched Jay Leno was, a champion of the status quo. You think the idea of Trump in the White House is as harmless as your face on a pint of Ben and Jerryâ€™s.  Maybe it is to you, as a powerful white man on TV who doesnâ€™t have to worry about life as a woman, Muslim, Black or Latin person, immigrant, or queer American living under Trumpism (an era which has already begun and will continue, regardless of whether Trump is elected). Your skit was nothing like Charlie Chaplinâ€™s Great Dictator, which brilliantly skewered a rising leader of the right. In fact, you did the opposite, making Trump seem more palatable. When history looks back on this moment, we may well say: Jimmy Fallon, you helped build a monster.

Roy Moore’s Accuser Worked for Democratic Leaders and Is Actively Campaigning for Moore’s Opponent ⋆ Activist Mommy,"On a street corner in Vedado, Havanaâ€™s most affluent suburb, pedestrians have had to manoeuvre around a   hole in the pavement on Calle 10 for months. Smashed concrete spills on to the road, encircling what has since turned into a pit of rubbish  â€”   a pockmark on the face of Havanaâ€™s fading grandeur. This is, according to residents, â€œthe way things areâ€ in the Cuban capital. As the city, its people and its architecture has aged, so too have its public services. While on the face of it, the city is getting a new lift through the easing of   relations, municipal support structures are failing badly in many parts of the city. As residents get tired of these inefficiencies, theyâ€™re expressing their anger  â€”   and pointing to the breakdown of Cuban socialism. â€œWhen Obama came [in March] they cleaned the whole street they put the beggars and homeless in a special asylum,â€ says Hamlet Lavastida, a    artist who lives in Havana. â€œThey made new roads, they painted many buildings, just in the areas where Obama was going to be. People joked that now weâ€™re going to have to wait another 50 years for the next US president to come, to make another new road . .. â€ These may just be lighthearted jokes for now, but Lavastida suggests there is a growing discontent among Cubans about the state of public services: the dirty streets, the broken infrastructure. â€œSometimes the telephone company  â€”   of course, controlled by the state  â€”   dig a hole to put in the wires and cables of the telephone, but they never cover the hole. They leave it like that for months,â€ he says.  Water leaks flow regularly across the streets of Havanaâ€™s barrios without being fixed. Waste can overflow public bins for weeks, with residents having no idea when it will be collected. When referring to the lack of cohesion between the various   centralised organisations  â€”   the communications company, the water company, the rubbish collectors (â€œcommunalesâ€)  â€”   Lavastida uses the word â€œanarchyâ€. Walking through the city centre with three writers from Havana Times  â€”   an   blog that describes itself as â€œ  writing from Cubaâ€  â€”   the conversation quickly turns to Havanaâ€™s streets. â€œWe have serious environmental problems in the city. Problems with garbage collection, sewage overflowing pits, air pollution,â€ they say. Such issues are obvious as you walk through the small backstreets just a few blocks away from El Capitolio, the old seat of government and one of the cityâ€™s grandest buildings. Instead of overpowering petrol fumes from Havanaâ€™s ageing cars, you smell sewage and dust compounding in the muggy air. We turn a corner and rubbish falls from a flowing dustbin. Stagnant water from a leaking drain sits along a pavement. Above it, a building with cracks in the wall is held up by wooden scaffolding.  â€œThe trash is all over the place,â€ says Luis Miguel Bahia, who lives in Cerro, one of Havanaâ€™s poorest municipalities. â€œI walk and when I turn the next corner hoping for some fresh air, there is the smell of this trash thatâ€™s all over the road, and I think: â€˜Where am I? Why did this place become like this? â€™â€ Unsurprisingly, the outer neighbourhoods and poorer communities are more neglected. Will Aurelievich also lives in Cerro he tells me that around his home their sewage system broke, and residents were having to avoid walking on â€œactual human shitâ€ as he describes it, for six months before it was fixed. He was planning on making a documentary about the problem, but coincidentally as soon as he started the project the state services came to fix it. Residents of Alamar, another neglected district, have often written in Havana Times about the inefficiencies in rubbish collection in their neighbourhood  â€”   one of the posts is entitled â€œCuba: till the shit do us partâ€. The communales (rubbish collection) apparently receives the biggest state budget but is said to be â€œone of the most inefficient sectors in the countryâ€. One of the problems, it seems, is the high level of bureaucracy here. The city administration is theoretically answerable to the national assembly of peopleâ€™s power, but they donâ€™t have budgetary control  â€”   that is in the hands of central government. A channel of complaint from the population can only lead to an advisory department, rather than the funding source, according to Stephen Wilkinson at the International Institute for the Study of Cuba. But above all, Cuba has limited resources. Itâ€™s a   country living with a   US embargo. Helen Yaffe, an LSE fellow who specialises in the Cuban economy and has spent years living in Havana, says: â€œYou have to start with the blockade [which has prevented trade and investment from the US since 1960] although you donâ€™t want to always sound defensive. But the authorities here have very limited budget. They have to prioritise what they do with their hard currency. â€ As Yaffe points out, Cuba is a country of contradictions. You might have to swerve a hole in the pavement on a daily basis, but the government does provide free universal healthcare and education (Raul Castro used these services as a defence when questioned about the governmentâ€™s record of human rights violations during Obamaâ€™s visit). Indeed, Yaffe recalls a time when her    daughter was struck with pneumonia when they were staying in Havana. â€œInside a hospital, the level of care was phenomenal. Yet we were in a room without hot running in water in fact, there wasnâ€™t even water all the time. â€œThis shows the contradictions that Cubaâ€™s had to face in terms of its development. Infrastructurally, theyâ€™re really struggling. â€ Lavastida, who recently moved back to his home country after living abroad for five years, acknowledges the lack of resources, but he suggests the disintegration of the cityâ€™s infrastructure and public services goes much deeper. He believes people care less about their local community, reflecting the breakdown in Cuban socialist values. â€œThereâ€™s a lack of public interest in what is happening in the street. This is somehow also part of the change that Cubans are becoming individualistic,â€ he says. He sees this apathy as a â€œpassive dissidenceâ€. â€œI remember when I was a kid there was something called Domingo Rojo (â€˜Red Sundayâ€™) and everybody in the neighbourhood decided we were going to clean the streets, like a communal voluntary service, and it was great. But nobody believes in the voluntary thing now, in communism. There is incredible hostility between government and citizens   â€¦     every day. â€ Bahia agrees. He has also noticed a feeling of apathy in Cuban society: â€œIn the long term people react to the the impositions [by the government] of solidarity, the community and so on. Those kinds of things must not be imposed because it creates the opposite effect. For example, with the trash on the street, I told a neighbour about it, and he said to me to take another route to avoid this trash. No one cares. â€ As more foreign money enters Havana, it seems individualism and the gap between rich and poor will only increase. The number of Cubans working in the private sector has reached nearly half a million  â€”   three times the number in 2008, and there is a new generation of nuevos ricos (new rich) who isolate those left on government wages. Habaneros worry that privatisation is slipping into the public sector: apparently if you hand the communales some money, theyâ€™ll take your rubbish straight away. In the last Community Party Congress in April, Raul Castro released new documents outlining the meaning of Cuban socialism. Yaffe says this was hugely significant, and â€œthe need for improvement is very much a focus of the plan documentâ€ but only time will tell if it will change the way Cubans feel about their communities. Walking back through Vedado, I see a machine grabbing some of the rubbish in Calle 10, engulfed in a cloud of dust. The machine stops, and the workmen expose the crater in the ground. Maybe it will be fixed soon, or maybe not.

politifact13467,http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/mental-images/5fj9vvsfwlksdjptig08plvhni8nkx,Mental Images,"With the presidential election less than a week away, my   optimism has given way to panic. Sheer,   panic. You see, up until now I had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the unimaginable: Donald Trump winning. But as election day looms closer, and the racism and sexism that infects Trumpâ€™s campaign is ratcheted up, itâ€™s hard not to be terrified. In the past week, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper endorsed Trump and white supremacists announced their plan for widespread voter intimidation. Trump   shouted antisemitic invective at reporters, and a historically black church in Mississippi was burned and â€œvote Trumpâ€ scrawled across the side. Another woman came forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault, and a Texas official called Hillary Clinton a â€œcuntâ€. This isnâ€™t a political divide between left and right, Democrats and Republicans itâ€™s an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why itâ€™s been easier for many horrified by Trump to simply pretend thereâ€™s no way that he could actually win the presidency. Imagining the hatred underlying his campaign and politics being emboldened in this way is just too much to bear.  If Trump wins  â€”   a possibility, even if it is unlikely  â€”   what will our country look like? What will happen to womenâ€™s rights, not just at a policy level, but in schools and in homes? How much more afraid will immigrants and people of color have to become that theyâ€™ll be ripped from their homes or killed on the street by the very people tasked to protect them? Part of the problem is that we already know the answers to these questions: weâ€™ve been living them. This election has uncovered something vile about America. That so many people would support a despicable candidate is not news to those hurt every day by racism, sexism and xenophobia we know itâ€™s alive and well in our country. Weâ€™ve been dealing with it our whole lives. But to see this hatred on such flagrant, unapologetic display is something else entirely.  Even if Trump loses, this isnâ€™t simply a bad dream that weâ€™ll awaken from on 9 November. A common refrain Iâ€™ve heard from Clinton supporters is that weâ€™re better than this  â€”   the hatred, the harassment. But if this race has shown us anything, itâ€™s that weâ€™re not better than this. The bigotry and misogyny  â€”   thatâ€™s who we are. Thatâ€™s what this country was built on. And even if Clinton wins next week, thatâ€™s who we will remain.  As wonderful as it will be to watch the first woman win the presidential election, it canâ€™t undo the truth of who we are. The deplorable people who feel they no longer need to hide their hatred arenâ€™t going anywhere after election day, no matter what happens. So I suppose my panic wasnâ€™t about the possibility of a Trump win, after all. Itâ€™s about the reality of the moment weâ€™re in, win or lose. Itâ€™s about the slime thatâ€™s risen to the top, the stink we canâ€™t wash off with one election or one president. We donâ€™t need to panic about the future, because the present already contains more horror than we can handle.",752,118,"6148718372	466518370426880	134215590532481024	136807154874204163	268977657662799873	413664129300180992	413673207401840640	418158744237637633	533521045408346112	533687154740711424	642278651308851200	665370770604957696	682219076828160000	719580754934501376	750114259959373824	758253506805497860	913447223022714881	930818959456206848	930819034010083329	930819097125969920	930819188863750145	930819225475846144	930835076056838145	930988385690374144	930988440715440128	934315543896739840	948659391947071489	973328962708422657	1020387251564548096	1052650591371976704	1054754230307864576	1055034956605505536	1055065149567049728	1055412440949755904	1055774834851020801	1056107003926450176	1059295297413791749	1062371365217619973	1063292867316236288	1065273841243627521	1068143349876617217",fake

She had walked away from her investment banking job, after realizing she had been relegated to working with the firmâ€™s most lackluster senior dealmaker. She was at home with her two children when it hit.  â€œI should be an equity research analyst!â€  It turned out to be the beginning of one of Wall Streetâ€™s storied careers, for one of the tiny handful of women to make it big. Accepting the only job offer she got, from Sanford C Bernstein, in 1995, Krawcheck was its chief executive by 2001. By 2002, Sandy Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, had lured her away to take over as head of Smith Barney.  In 2005, she was chief financial officer of Citigroup and tipped to become Wall Streetâ€™s first female CEO. Even her   firing following the financial crisis didnâ€™t derail her career: Krawcheck surfaced as the head of the newly merged Bank of America Merrill Lynchâ€™s wealth management division, charged with overseeing the famed â€œthundering herdâ€.  Then Bank of Americaâ€™s CEO, Brian Moynihan, possibly threatened by her high profile, offered her a choice between departure or demotion. She chose to leave. The aftermath of that   Wall Street power struggle led to her next great eureka moment. â€œThere are different ways to attack the boysâ€™ club than from the inside,â€ she tells the Guardian. For years after her 2011 â€œresignationâ€ from Bank of America, Krawcheck debated with herself. She knew being a woman had given her a fundamentally different perspective on the way that Merrill Lynchâ€™s â€œherdâ€ of largely male brokers and financial advisers did business, a view that had been shaped and refined by her years at Citigroup. â€œBut I made all the arguments to myself,â€ she says. â€œThere were plenty of firms out there alreadyâ€ that could opt to do business in a different way, to serve their clients  â€”   especially women  â€”   better. Except that they didnâ€™t.  â€œI watched and watched,â€ Krawcheck says. The percentage of financial advisers at big Wall Street firms that were men remained unchanged, about 85%. And that matters, she says, because they didnâ€™t pay much attention to the women among their clientele, even when they thought they did.  â€œWeâ€™d study this, when a male adviser met with a couple, and ask him how much time he thought he spent interacting with each member of them, and heâ€™d say, â€˜Oh,  . â€™â€  In fact, the evidence showed he had spent 90% of his time talking to the man, and not realized it. Unsurprisingly, Krawcheck found that when they were widowed, 70% of Merrillâ€™s clients took their assets and left.  BMO Wealth Institute calculates that women control about 51% of all personal wealth in the US, or some $14tn, and projects that figure to hit $22tn by 2020. Investment firms cannot afford to disregard women or to lose them as clients. And yet they werenâ€™t hiring women as advisers. â€œOne firm used a marine corps questionnaire for hiring,â€ Krawcheck recalls. Since it wasnâ€™t her job to force Wall Street into recognizing what it was doing wrong, she decided to try to start doing it the right way. The first step was the purchase in spring 2013 of 85 Broads, a financial membership and networking community established by alumnae of Goldman Sachs, which she promptly renamed Ellevate Network, to reflect its new mission: to provide more women with a way to become involved and engaged in their finances. Earlier this year, she rolled out the next stage of her plan, Ellevest: an investment platform designed around womenâ€™s needs and priorities, not those of the men who run Wall Street and the firms where she cut her teeth. â€œThe whole icon of a bull that stands for Wall Street  â€”   you couldnâ€™t come up with an image of a more male environment,â€ she says. â€œWomen feel that the brand doesnâ€™t speak to them. â€  They also, she argues, speak a very different language when it comes to money, and have very different objectives, which men donâ€™t grasp at all. To the extent that the big Wall Street firms attempt to cater to women, they â€œpinkifyâ€ their offerings, Krawcheck says. Why, she asks, does a   approach to investing â€œhave to mean the junior version?  â€œSomehow there is this feeling that women require remedial financial education and so everything must be dumbed down. The reality is that we all need a lot more education, but guys just go ahead and invest anyway. â€  Krawcheckâ€™s irritation and anger at this kind of systemic bias  â€”   and its impact on women, who end up so alienated by the Wall Street system and so daunted by the difficult of finding a firm or an independent adviser who will listen to them that they simply avoid seeking out the investment advice they need  â€”   creep through her trademark charm and humor.  When others suggest that it doesnâ€™t make sense to focus on the investment gender gap because itâ€™s more important to close the gender pay gap first, you can almost hear her grit her teeth before answering.  â€œThatâ€™s like saying you broke your arm and you broke your leg, but Iâ€™m not going to fix your broken arm because I canâ€™t fix your broken leg yet!â€  As far as the gender pay gap itself is concerned, she has no patience at all. â€œJust frigginâ€™ pay them moreâ€ is Krawcheckâ€™s message to companies that still compensate men and women inequitably. â€œOh, and if you havenâ€™t stopped to check whether you have a gender pay gap? You do. â€  And now Krawcheck has created a place where those women, tired of   investment jabber about relative   ratios and the best   growth mutual fund to pick, can find an investment home. Krawcheckâ€™s Ellevest does not â€œpinkifyâ€ investing, she insists, but it does start the process in a very different way. Ellevestâ€™s objective isnâ€™t to design a portfolio that will beat the market or focus on the exciting investment concept of the day. Instead, the   designs portfolios based on the userâ€™s investment time horizon and risk tolerance.  â€œWomen think in terms of   investing,â€ she explains. Itâ€™s slightly pricier than rivals (the fee is 0. 5% of assets a year) but cheaper than working with a traditional financial adviser would be. Moreover, as Krawcheck points out, itâ€™s a process designed to ensure that women actually feel that their portfolios and goals are in sync.  â€œWomen value capital preservation many times more than men, but you wonâ€™t find that reflectedâ€ at Merrill Lynch or anywhere else in the industry, she argues. Itâ€™s early days still. If the company thrives, however, thereâ€™s no downside: success will give women an alternative to the Merrill Lynches of the world and give the latter a   wakeup call, the kind that its leaders couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t listen to from inside the walls.

One local told CBS New York that at first glance, it seemed like the canal was covered in frost. The actual cause was much more grim: the water was covered almost completely in dead fish. Tom Jones, a marine adviser at Hampton Watercraft, also thought the water looked like it was covered in ice when he first saw it. â€œI knew what it was straightaway, but it was pretty overwhelming to see those sheer numbers,â€ he told the Guardian. He recalled fish dying in nearby Riverhead, New York, in the past. Using a drone, Jones took a video of the thousands of fish in the water and posted it on the Hampton Watercraft YouTube channel on Tuesday. The canalâ€™s surface was covered with fish. â€œEverybody that sees it says it must have smelled but it did not at all,â€ Jones said of his video. He thought the water was cold enough to have preserved the fish and prevented any bad odors.  The New York state department of environmental conservation is investigating the incident. In a statement, the agency said the bunker fish, also known as Atlantic menhaden, were â€œmost likely chased into the canal by other predatory fishâ€. The Shinnecock canal, which connects Shinnecock Bay and Great Peconic Bay, was closed at 3am on Monday, trapping the fish within. â€œPreliminary field analysis suggests the trapped fish died due to a lack of dissolved oxygen and the high density of fish,â€ the statement read. The agency and the Suffolk County health department collected samples for further analysis. The canal was   at 10am that same day, and the fish  â€”   dead and alive  â€”   entered Shinnecock Bay. Some of the dead fish are floating in the bay, though the majority are believed to have sunk to the bottom. The DEC has arranged aerial flights to track the floating fish and the town of Southampton has been clearing dead fish off its beaches. The agency said that no additional fish kills have been reported and the massive   â€œdoes not suggest any impacts to the health of Shinnecock Bayâ€.",223,183,,fake

The development follows the revelation this week that Taliban officials held two rounds of secret talks with Afghanistanâ€™s spy chief and a senior US diplomat in the capital of the Gulf state, Doha, this month and last month  â€”   meetings Pakistan was excluded from despite its long association with the Islamist movement. Two sources within the insurgency told the Guardian that a trio of Taliban diplomats left Doha on Wednesday with a mission to hold talks with Pakistani officials. â€œThe visiting Afghan Taliban delegation will discuss various topics, including peace talks, and share the latest information with Pakistan,â€ a senior official told the Guardian. The men are Maulvi Shahabuddin Dilawar, a former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Jan Muhammad Madani, a former foreign minister under the Taliban regime in the 1990s, and Mullah Abdul Salam, a former deputy education minister. The Taliban official said the discussions being held in Pakistan follow successful contacts made with both Afghan and US officials in recent months. â€œTaliban and the Americans have been engaged in a number of rounds of talks in Qatar,â€ he said. â€œThey have made some progress, on a very zigzag path. God willing, we hope further talks will create progress. â€ Last year Pakistan succeeded in establishing itself as the host and broker of an effort to end the   insurgency in Afghanistan. Islamabad managed to bring Taliban, US and Chinese diplomats around the same table at a breakthrough meeting in the Pakistani hill resort of Murree in July 2015.  But a scheduled second meeting never took place after the Afghan government confirmed that the former Taliban leader Mullah Omar had died years previously and that the movement had been run in his name by Mullah Akhtar Mansoor.  After a bitter leadership fight, Mansoor formally became the Taliban leader but showed little interest in   in the   process. Mansoor was killed by a US drone strike in May, creating further uncertainty about the chances of peace talks. Although Pakistan has been a key ally for the Taliban during both its rise to power in the 1990s and its   as an   insurgency after 2001, some within the movement resent Pakistani interference in the Talibanâ€™s affairs. A Taliban official who talked to the Guardian said the groupâ€™s current leader, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, had sought to â€œspeed upâ€ talks with Kabul and the US. He said: â€œPakistan and the rest of the neighbours will be gradually brought on board. Pakistan is an important neighbour and no doubt they will want to be involved. â€ But a western official who was aware that at least two of the Taliban envoys had travelled to Pakistan said the envoysâ€™ meeting was unlikely to be related to the recent Doha talks. The official said it was an attempt by Islamabad to wrest back control and escape â€œimmense US pressure and international isolationâ€. â€œThey and a group from Quetta are talking to the Pakistanis about a   process,â€ the official said. â€œThis is a separate initiative to escape US and Chinese pressure. â€ The official said some within the Taliban had objected to the way members of the political commission appear to have been summoned to Islamabad.  The Taliban is split between rival factions, both among and between commanders on the battlefield in Afghanistan and those living inside Pakistan. Bitter divides exist over whether to pursue peace talks or not, as well as over the control of money and resources. The western official described the current situation within the movement as â€œchaos as normalâ€. Quoting a Taliban official, the Associated Press reported this week that the head of the Doha office had not taken part in the talks with the Afghan government, reflecting â€œa continuing power struggle within the movement over who should run the Qatar officeâ€. A Pakistani intelligence official declined to comment on the latest claims.",135,176,8.64E+17,fake

Democrats BOO and GROAN at Trump Mention of Murder Victims of MS-13 Killers (VIDEO),"The image of a   Tim Cook kicking the   tyres of Jay Zâ€™s most expensive vehicle may seem an anomalous one, but according to the Wall Street Journal it could actually happen as the Apple CEO considers making a bid for the music streaming service Tidal. While still at the speculation stage, it initially reads as counterintuitive. Why would Apple, whose own Apple Music has gone from a standing start a year ago to 15 million subscribers, want to buy a service that is a fraction of its size? Tidal claims to have 4. 2 million subscribers, but there are questions as to how many of them will stay the distance as they were hooked in with a hat trick of exclusives this year from BeyoncÃ©, Kanye West and Rihanna, plus holding some of Princeâ€™s back catalogue. As Apple has proved with the iPod, iTunes, the iPhone and the iPad, its skill lies in taking existing ideas and products, perfecting them and catapulting them into the mainstream. The history of Tidal would suggest it is in desperate need of being perfected.  Originally launched in Scandinavia as WiMP, it was a niche but   service whose parent company Aspiro was acquired by Project Panther, an investment group fronted by Jay Z, for $54m last March. Its public launch as Tidal was a ludicrous carnival of megalomania, where Jay Z wheeled out his famous friends  â€”   including Madonna, Daft Punk, Rihanna, Drake and his wife, BeyoncÃ©  â€”   to sign a â€œdeclarationâ€ saying they would support the service and give it exclusives. They also got equity in the service as part of the deal. This folly of a launch proved an omen for how things would subsequently play out. Madonna immediately premiered her video for Ghosttown on   app Meerkat instead of Tidal. After that, Drake defected to Apple, which bankrolled his Hotline Bling video and he returned the favour by giving Apple Music the initial exclusive on his Views album in April this year. In October, during a trial relating to sampling on his Big Pimpinâ€™ track, Jay Z was asked to list his business interests. He failed to mention Tidal and when it was brought up said, â€œYeah, yeah. Forgot about that. â€ On and on the calamities barreled. Its first big exclusive in 2016 was Rihannaâ€™s Anti in January, but it went live early, was pulled, then reappeared with Samsung bankrolling 1m free downloads of a release that was supposed to promote streaming. In February, Kanye West put his The Life Of Pablo album on Tidal, saying it would be never be available anywhere else. That lasted until April when other services got it. Some stability returned later that month with the release of BeyoncÃ©â€™s Lemonade, which was a genuine event, but there was a growing sense that Tidal was turning into the punchline to a gruesome joke. That could all have dented its value, and perhaps Apple now sees an opportunity here where others see catastrophe.  After so many public disasters, why would Apple, given its obsession with control, want to buy something that looks increasingly less like a Porsche and more like a clown car? The first and most obvious reason would be to bulk up its market share and close the gap on Spotify, with its 30 million paying subscribers (out of 100 million total users). But that is a   solution, a bit like hailing a taxi for half a mile at the start of a marathon. The longer play would appear to be around getting access to some of the biggest artists in the world and persuading them to back Apple Music and not, plucking a name out of the air totally at random, Spotify. This is not unchartered territory for Apple, as it proved with its $3bn acquisition of Beats in 2014, which provided the chassis for what was to become Apple Music. Its strategy there was as much about buying talent as it was about buying technology, as with Beats came the addition of Dr Dre, Jimmy Iovine and Trent Reznor to Appleâ€™s team. This time it could scoop up many of the biggest names in pop in one move.  Spotify has suffered publicly in the past from attacks by artists like Thom Yorke and Taylor Swift while Apple has, ever since the massively misjudged step of trying to offer   trials to Apple Music without paying royalties, been conducting a charm offensive among the artist community. Buying up Tidal, which has been trying to brand itself as the   streaming service, could immediately give it the ears of the biggest pop stars on the planet. Plus, they will all, because they have equity in Tidal, get a windfall  â€”   which was clearly always the end goal with Tidal and will only further sweeten any deal with Apple. Tidalâ€™s value is perhaps not as high at this stage as Jay Z envisioned for it but, like opportunistic couples with limited DIY skills buying dilapidated houses to quickly flip them, he perhaps is admitting to himself that he can only take it so far. The streaming market is incredibly tough, with Rdio collapsing last year and everyone else running up huge debts as they burn through their funding. Jay Z and his friends might get their payday, but Apple will get the celebrity ammunition it hopes will crash Spotify out of the race.  The exclusives to date on Tidal have felt, primarily because of its small market size, like damp squibs. However, with Appleâ€™s enormous marketing budgets behind them they could shoot into the sky like the Fourth of July fireworks while, in the corner, Spotify sits glumly holding a sparkler.

The figures emerged on a day that Labour demanded Theresa May guaranteed the rights of the more than 3 million EU citizens to remain in the UK before Brexit negotiations begin, with MP Keir Starmer saying there was â€œa mounting sense of very real injusticeâ€ over the issue. The number of outstanding applications from European citizens to secure their residency status in Britain went from 37, 618 in June 2015 to almost 100, 000 â€œcurrently in progressâ€ in early July 2016, including those seeking permanent residence cards and documents for   family members of European citizens. Home Office figures to be published on Thursday alongside official immigration data for the three months to September are expected to confirm the surge in applications has continued since the EU referendum on 23 June. Starmer called for urgent unilateral action by the prime minister to secure the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and warned her to abandon her position of refusing to act without securing equivalent guarantees for the 1. 2 million UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. â€œItâ€™s becoming increasingly apparent to me from my discussions in Brussels with those that are likely to be involved in the negotiations that they are very concerned about the fact that we are not giving comfort and status to their citizens,â€ the shadow Brexit secretary told the Guardian. â€œThey have said to me, pretty well in terms, the UK should sort this out before March and that would ensure that the article 50 negotiations got off to a much better start than they will otherwise do so. â€ At prime ministerâ€™s questions on Wednesday, May defended her approach in a question from the Conservative MP Peter Lilley, saying: â€œI think the reaction that we have seen shows it was absolutely right for us not to do what the Labour party wanted us to do, which was simply to give away the guarantee for rights of EU citizens here in the UK. As we have seen, that would have left UK citizens in Europe high and dry. â€ Relations between the UK and the rest of the EU have become increasingly heated.  On Tuesday, the European council president, Donald Tusk, published a strongly worded letter to a group of Tory MPs in which he said the issue would have to wait for formal Brexit negotiations to begin and appeared to blame the British electorate for causing the uncertainty in the first place. In his letter, he added: â€œThe only way to dispel the fears and doubts of all citizens concerned is the quickest possible start of the negotiations based on article 50 of the treaty. â€ Starmer described Tuskâ€™s letter as unhelpful, but said it pointed to the need to act unilaterally now and was further evidence of the â€œunhelpful atmosphereâ€ created in the   to the negotiations. Starmer suggested the government could â€œpass a domestic law, dealing with the status of these individuals, and it would get   support, and could be passed very swiftlyâ€. He added: â€œAt the very least there ought to be clarity for those who were already here on 23 June. â€ Quarterly net migration data are expected to show that annual figure remains more than three times above Mayâ€™s target of 100, 000.  The Home Office is expected to deflect some of the political embarrassment by announcing the rollout of two further measures from Thursday designed to create a â€œhostile environmentâ€ that it will say will discourage illegal immigration.  They are tougher penalties, including prison sentences, for landlords who rent to tenants without proper immigration papers and the start of a â€œdeport first, appeal laterâ€ policy for those challenging some immigration decisions. Saira Grant, the chief executive of the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants, said the social fallout from the Brexit vote had led to the government urgently positioning itself as a champion of integration.  But she said ministersâ€™ fixation on the net migration target was leading to toxic immigration policies that were causing critical harm to community relations and to cohesion in Britain. â€œItâ€™s not good enough for the government to talk about the tensions caused by immigration and a lack of integration, when their own polices are designed to create suspicion within communities, to encourage profiling of those who appear to be immigrants, and to reduce immigrantsâ€™ security within the UK,â€ she said. â€œIntegration comes when immigrants and the communities they live in can trust each other and understand that they will be treated fairly within the immigration system. Openly using EU migrants as bargaining chips, asking landlords, doctors, schools, and local authorities to act as border guards, is setting back integration and community cohesion across the UK. â€ Grantâ€™s warning came as Madelene Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford University, told the House of Lords EU home affairs subcommittee that the number of citizens of other EU countries in Britain could be as high as 3. 9 million and the task of registering them after Brexit would be a â€œformidable logistical, bureaucratic, administrative and legal taskâ€. Sumption said a work permit system would be the most practical option for controlling EU migration   as it would take account of the various needs of the economy. An â€œemergency brakeâ€ approach, reported to be under consideration in Downing Street, would, however, simply limit numbers without taking individual skills into account, she said. Thecampaign group Migration Watch UK urged the government on Wednesday to close the door on unskilled labour migration from the EU by extending the current   work permit system to EU migrants. Consideration might be given to a â€œkey workers schemeâ€ for lower skilled workers, including seasonal agricultural workers, deemed essential to particular sectors of the economy. But Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research told peers that ending the free movement of   workers from the EU could see businesses close, food prices rise and cuts to social care. Portes, a former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, said the consequences for the agricultural industry were particularly grave: â€œThey may range from simply shutting down, going out of business, in which case consumers would either buy different products or products from abroad   â€¦     Another possible response is higher wages which would probably be passed onto consumers. â€ He said the government needed to consider urgently how it was going to register all the EU citizens in Britain, adding that it was unrealistic simply and undesirable to include everyone who was in the UK on the day of the referendum. â€œThere is no definition of residence, or proof of residence, for people who have been here. What about the Polish shopkeeper who went home on 23 June? We do not know who was in the country. â€ A Home Office spokesperson said: â€œGovernment has been clear that, as we conduct our negotiations, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe. It would not be right for us to give a running commentary on negotiations. â€ Asked when the issue of expatriates could be expected to be settled, Mayâ€™s official spokeswoman said: â€œThis is an issue that we are very clear matters to Europeans here in the UK and Brits in Europe. â€œTherefore, in the spirit of working constructively together and having that kind of mature relationship with our European partners, itâ€™s an issue that should be settled early on.  â€œItâ€™s a   process once we trigger (Article 50) so these are going to be lengthy negotiations. â€   ",587,570,"831652409315319808	831685870113738755	831698681694806016	831698685410963456	831698695133372416	831698697146609664	831698696408477697	831698700288155648	831700158974824448	831700173503860737	831700178562273280	831700181607292928	831700923122487296	831703861807218688	831705011939708928	831735222152605698	831764048781905924	831771850887806976	831832074273320960	831870848348860420	831871310904954880	831871315405443073	831872763799298049	831872767339360256	831872765087014916	831872769717465089	831872773685342209	831872780891152384	831872786104594433	831872805079638018	831873492064755712	831873524000124930	831901432651608065	831924485372596224	831980597316710400	831999475275149312	832014088335134721	832039459541643264	832049299265638401	832191690077249536	832244431369674752	832270859985301505	832871863449767938	832987045765246976	832987199486492672	832987490009096192	833025712873410562	833060923531264000	833061972245622785	833063129856737280	833081901103583232	833527763319607298	833547414174826496	833581205706596353	833594013471039489	833668139317678080	833671019688841222	833672966332416001	833786899961614338	833815215984750594	833819376910491649	833826873729744899	833845300209020928	833859987231342592	833867684987158529	833875833488076800	833913265310797824	833926899948720128	834018284181868545	834023172395696128	834042920659460097	834064064800231425	834075600734281728	834079622547513344	834085617675808769	834088655010553857	834100752771608580	834102954986708994	834102994991882242	834113121845288960	834115307685834753	834130648122134532	834147312406499331	834167668253024258	834184832087420928	834186215440138240	834189980721434624	834194878452137986	834211042037268480	834211525116194816	834220095651995648	834231221085368321	834231674833666048	834258145920872449	834262405936984066	834271460956979200	834278580884533248	834377191597207553	834382102267322368	834399084924526593	834403331019796480	834501563460706304	834502486769561600	834519858989690881	834555554269974528	834565427158216705	834588297745879040	834614952686149635	834634841308151808	834863114730557440	834886378362126337	834901502967840770	835159707148926977	835350453571448833	835379135962886144	835390855510900736	835884494687191041	839159974194360321	839722221111238657	849475186470551552	851851574628544512	852098363298377728	863019733595148290",fake
politifact15486,https://yournewswire.com/anthony-bourdain-killed-clinton-operatives/,Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton Operatives,"The daughter of the late   US congressman Tom Lantos said on Sunday she is returning a distinguished state award to Hungary. Katrina Lantos Swett is protesting against the giving of the same award to journalist and writer Zsolt Bayer, who has made antisemitic and racist references in his articles. Lantos Swett, who received the Knightâ€™s Cross of the Order of Merit in 2009, joins more than 100 other recipients in returning their awards.  Lantos Swett was honored for her work in setting up the   Tom Lantos Institute, which focuses on minority rights. Tom Lantos, a California Democrat who died in 2008, was the only Holocaust survivor in Congress. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington earlier called on Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban and President Janos Ader, who respectively nominated and granted the award to Bayer in August, to â€œimmediatelyâ€ rescind it. Aderâ€™s office told news website hvg. hu that based on current laws the award could not be recalled. Lantos Swett said that she had hoped to leave the award to her children, but felt Bayerâ€™s distinction had â€œsulliedâ€ the Knightâ€™s Cross. â€œMr Bayerâ€™s despicable record of overt and hateful antisemitism and racism is beneath contempt,â€ Lantos Swett said in a statement. â€œHe deserves censure, not honor, for his loathsome writings and speech. â€ She added that she was sure her father â€œwould call on Hungary to restore the honor and virtue of this award by stripping Mr Bayer of this unmerited recognitionâ€. An occasional columnist for the rightwing Magyar Hirlap daily, Bayer is close to prime minister Orban and   a civil group that has organised massive   street demonstrations. A member of Orbanâ€™s Fidesz party, he was distinguished on 20 August, for his writings about the Hungarian minority in Transylvania, the fates of Hungarian prisoners in the Soviet Gulag prison system and for his â€œexemplary journalistic activitiesâ€. Magyar Hirlap, however, was fined by media authorities in 2013 and earlier this year for hateful remarks about Roma and Muslims in Bayerâ€™s columns. In 2013, writing about a New Yearâ€™s Eve bar fight in which several people were seriously injured and some of the attackers were identified as Roma, Bayer wrote: â€œA significant part of the Roma are unfit for coexistence. They are not fit to live among people. These Roma are animals and they behave like animals. â€ In a November 2015 column about the migrant crisis and extremism, Bayer said all Muslims older than 14 were â€œpotential murderersâ€. He has also written remarks deemed antisemitic in a country with a Jewish community estimated at more than 100, 000. Bayer told website Mandiner. hu that receiving the award required him to be more restrained and, for example, abandon the foul language he often uses in his columns. Last year, he also said he regretted using some of the phrases deemed to be racist or antisemitic. The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities issued an ironic statement, saying that the government had given Bayer the award to cheer up the â€œunsuccessful and grumpyâ€ journalist, since his â€œfrustrated cursing, and monotonous, hysterical and pitiful hatred harms not only he himself but the public mood, as wellâ€. Several earlier recipients of state awards, including Miklos Haraszti, a former OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, were planning to auction off their medals on Sunday in benefit of destitute children and families, but the event was canceled. Auction sponsor Klubradio, which the Orban government tried for years to ban from the airwaves, said it was called off because organizers of a street festival where the auction would have been held asked for its cancellation because of its political nature.",744,196,"1005889143799508994	1005906117744984064	1005906386624995329	1005907244100317184	1005917146973687808	1005928975342997505	1005930065148956673	1005930420490395648	1005930462005616644	1005930582252060676	1005931653376630784	1005941784063725568	1005943297343459328	1005945424241463296	1005945628910899200	1005945933593489409	1005951051445436416	1005960790808014848	1005962841231245314	1005964903465848833	1005966073877991426	1005966199786745856	1005966408503750657	1005966606571368449	1005966984448757762	1005967119115341825	1005967172898734081	1005967233422712833	1005967333091872773	1005967599602106368	1005972256659591168	1005975951556136960	1005978110909714433	1005983590096793600	1005988053410877440	1005989570251509761	1005990615241318400	1005991288699678720	1005997885635248128	1005998406811226113	1006005368365993985	1006005403191259136	1006013806286331905	1006014390301331456	1006023836415025153	1006031426326802432	1006040590033784834	1006088060017172480	1006113204269875200	1006124627117137920	1006132190273470466	1006138063939096576	1006150117295116289	1006157144192929792	1006172812070019073	1006174646188662784	1006177136993034240	1006182438907850755	1006182547389276161	1006187806455197697	1006188601846054913	1006204436115533825	1006205824396644352	1006207363014012928	1006207674478784512	1006220342375821312	1006220345534132225	1006237729879977984	1006241547489349633	1006246182320869382	1006252842288599042	1006254429006368769	1006255093455507458	1006256692697264128	1006264567226421250	1006270865523105797	1006274069719801857	1006277698510082051	1006285542319906818	1006291713139322880	1006297380453355520	1006306405316345856	1006318173241606144	1006323691964203009	1006357365262725120	1006380587500916737	1006381147243376640	1006386999719268353	1006390314557411328	1006396819100848130	1006436470368886784	1006444126496329729	1006460720215744513	1006461238505869312	1006466261814005760	1006475135149195265	1006480089658331136	1006529367500120064	1006546818082263040	1006550499653488640	1006555541370540032	1006581952068177922	1006585522532126720	1006593822359339009	1006602352965619712	1006609196668907520	1006637804305174528	1006651336472055811	1006690316676730880	1006939544162205697	1006940055187939328	1007028154723176448	1007111495354867712	1007132217510854656	1007251327775330304	1007298778393726977	1007331298153820162	1007393965291769856	1007786100511985664	1007790604414222336	1007961101496193025	1008160474821812225	1008184602538790914	1009386906612887553	1009664771900231680	1009800269385912320	1010052866587922433	1010287463707930624	1010294699427414017	1010314753208668161	1010343558614667265	1011738297163448321	1012456322841882624	1012827518452281344	1013621597779918849	1015700970863579142	1015802535486132224	1015973861630861314	1016014802190241793	1016234401015869445	1016277134195740673	1016392856511156225	1016754378168885248	1016870141991313409	1016890676221444096	1017062498242097152	1018376887226077184	1018683438956675072	1019038348441276417	1025863792381452288	1030545309825425408	1039641595233087488",fake
politifact15399,http://24trueinfoamerica.com/breaking-60-people-just-found-dead-in-ohio,BREAKING: 60 People Just Found Dead In Ohio,"In a segment on Last Week Tonight that has now been viewed millions of times, John Oliver turned his attention to changes in the news industry. He highlighted the pressures facing journalists who keep elected officials and institutions honest and imagined a future in which investigations like the one dramatized in the   movie Spotlight would be impossible. Here, four writers share their views on the future of the media. I just finished writing that race is the biggest story in the United States, and about the role of journalists of color in helping the nation bridge our divides. I referenced the 1968 report of the Kerner Commission on the racial uprisings of the 1960s, which said, â€œit is the responsibility of the news media to tell the story of race relations in America, and with notable exceptions, the media have not yet turned to the task with the wisdom, sensitivity and expertise it demands. â€ The wide gap between whites and people of color on such questions as the extent of racial discrimination demonstrates that those words are still applicable  â€”   journalists still have much vital work ahead of them. Meanwhile, the Washington Post just ran a   story Thursday headlined, â€œEven under oath, Trump struggled with the truth,â€ outlining the many times the Republican candidate for president has willfully lied. The previous day another Post   story reported, â€œEmail batch provides additional evidence that Clinton Foundation donors got access at State Department. â€ Where would we be without such journalism? There are few citizen duties greater than electing our national leader, and itâ€™s crucial that we be informed while doing so. The framers of our US constitution recognized the vital role of the press in a democracy when they formulated the first amendment.  Most of us have heard of Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s statement, â€œwere it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. â€ However, letâ€™s also note his next line: â€œBut I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. â€ Richard Prince writes the journalism diversity blog   If you have watched the   movie Spotlight, you will have heard about me  â€”   I was one of the sources for the Boston Globeâ€™s investigation on sexual abuse in the church. My colleagues and I spent 25 years working to expose this crisis in the United States. We wrote articles, gave talks, helped organize national conferences for victims and survivors of clergy assaults, church denial and coverups. But it took the media to make sure we were heard. There were modest accounts in local papers that paved the way for documentation of a   scandal. It was not easy. Institutional denial and power resisted at every turn. Many local journalists, most cautiously and with editorsâ€™ deference to the power of church opposition, followed leads about abuse victims and priest predators. Church sources derided and tried to discredit whistleblowers. Survivors movements from the 1980s onward made a ruckus with the distribution of flyers, often at church parking lots where abusing priests had served. Legal cases began to make headlines when settlements for clergy violations began to hit the millions. Coverage remained scatted and disjointed until the Boston Globeâ€™s Spotlight Team pulled together the threads around one case that epitomized the pattern and practice of the nationwide and worldwide scandal in the Catholic church. The power of that investigative reporting simply cannot be overstated.  AW Richard Sipe is an expert on sexual behaviors of Roman Catholic clergy, Freedom isnâ€™t free and  â€”   youâ€™re not going to like this America nobody does  â€”   thatâ€™s true for the press too. John Oliverâ€™s viral newspaper rant struck a nerve for the same reason things often do: because itâ€™s correct. If you want to read good journalism in this country, somebodyâ€™s going to have to start paying for it. And it should probably be you. This is confusing to a lot of us because we always assumed it was our   right to never have to pay for anything on the internet. But now journalismâ€™s primary home is the internet, and nobody knows how to replace even a tiny fraction of the profits the industry has lost from diminishing print ads. Thereâ€™s no reliable formula for making profitable journalism profitable that Iâ€™m aware of  â€”   every place Iâ€™ve ever worked has lost money much, if not all of the time. Itâ€™s just a question of how much they were willing to lose. The most promising model right now seems to be to subsist on the fumes of venture capitalism or have a millionaire to   benefactor. The latterâ€™s an imperfect model for all the reasons Oliver and common sense suggest. Itâ€™s even problematic for reasons not suggested! The truth is, weâ€™re going to have to pay for our journalism one way or another, and in many ways, we already are. We pay for it every time, say, the Las Vegas   runs a toothless story on owner Sheldon Adelson or doesnâ€™t cover something critical of one of his friends. We pay for it in shrinking newsrooms around the country. And we pay for it in vapid stories about   or   or   . And donâ€™t get too excited about that last one (I like reading about pizza rat too) we donâ€™t pay nearly enough with our clicks. I donâ€™t have a plan make journalism a viable profession in the future, but there is a way in which you personally can make the media better. Thatâ€™s important because most Americans donâ€™t like the media very much and havenâ€™t since, oh . .. right around Watergate. If you want to like the media more, try remembering that the media is actually comprised of humans, most of them working extremely hard and with limited resources to get the story right. Also remember that those humans work in an industry that supports democracy (or is supposed to) but is not itself supported by democracy very well. If you want good journalism and a press you admire, try making that more possible by getting a subscription to your local paper, or a national one, or any one at all. Lucia Graves is a columnist for Guardian US, The question of what happens to communities when publications canâ€™t afford to pay journalists to write stories usually centers on the loss of hard news and investigative reporting, and probably rightly so. But newspapers, with their feature stories, have also served a function as a community voice. For 18 years I wrote a near daily feature column for two newspapers in Madison, Wisconsin. That ended in June 2015 when I was called into the editorâ€™s office and immediately terminated, along with a few other longtime colleagues. The newspaper never gave me a chance to say farewell to my readers. After 4, 000 columns, they just â€œdisappearedâ€ me.  Since leaving, many readers reached out to me to say how much they miss the institutional knowledge of the city and its people that informed the stories that my colleagues and I wrote. I watched many talented colleagues walk out the door before I made that walk myself. To borrow a phrase, it was like watching a library burn down. My columns were once collected in a book called Surrounded by Reality. If you know Madison, you get the reference. One reviewer noted: â€œHis daily features are able to connect the present to the past, effectively telling the ongoing tale of the city and its people. â€ It was a privilege, and sad to realize those days may be disappearing.

politifact15298,http://usalibertypress.com/2018/02/24/with-trump-we-avoided-war-with-russia-and-orwellian-police-state/,Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian Police State,"A onetime top ally of the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, said the governor and his New York counterpart, Andrew Cuomo, discussed releasing a false report to tamp down questions over the George Washington Bridge   scandal, the prosecutionâ€™s key witness testified on Tuesday. David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty in the gridlock scheme and is cooperating with prosecutors, said the former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey chairman David Samson told him the governors discussed the idea in October 2013. The report would have attributed the lane closures to a traffic study, covering up the true reason for the closures: political retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee for failing to endorse Christieâ€™s 2013   Wildstein testified. The report was never issued.  Instead, Bill Baroni testified before lawmakers in November 2013, two months after the lane closures, that they were part of a traffic study.   Baroni, who served as Christieâ€™s top appointed staff aide at the Port Authority, and Bridget Kelly, Christieâ€™s former deputy chief of staff, are on trial facing wire fraud and civil rights charges. They have pleaded not guilty.   Wildstein said the idea for the report came as news reporters began to ask questions about the lane closures, which gridlocked the town of Fort Lee for four days.   â€œMy understanding was that [Republican] Governor Christie and [Democratic] Governor Cuomo had discussed this,â€ Wildstein said under   on Tuesday, according to the Record, adding he was told the information by Samson. â€œMy understanding at the time was that it would put an end to this issue. â€   Cuomo spokesman John Kelly, who is not related to Bridget Kelly, denied the conversation between governors took place and criticized Wildstein as a â€œfelon spinning a taleâ€.   â€œItâ€™s just false and delusional,â€ Kelly said.   Messages left with Christieâ€™s office were not immediately returned. A message left with Samsonâ€™s attorney has not been returned. Samson pleaded guilty in another case to using his role as Port Authority chairman to influence United Airlines to reinstate a   route closer to his vacation home and is awaiting sentencing.  Wildstein, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees New   bridges and tunnels, testified earlier that Baroni told Christie about the traffic jams as they were happening and said the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee was not happy that he was not getting his calls returned.  Christie has not been charged and says he did not authorize the closures or play a role in covering them up.

politifact14927,http://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-24934979/oprah-winfrey-the-butler-racism-and-obama,"Oprah Winfrey: The Butler, racism and Obama","Mike Pence hopes to make a bigger mark than the last Republican from Indiana to run for  . Dan Quayle, who served under George HW Bush, is not remembered kindly by history, not least for an incident in which he changed a studentâ€™s spelling of â€œpotatoâ€ to â€œpotatoeâ€. At 57, Pence is more experienced than Quayle. The governorâ€™s selection as Donald Trumpâ€™s running mate brings many qualities to the candidateâ€™s campaign that Republicans fear it lacks: discipline, experience in government, conservative principles and credibility among Christian evangelicals. It also draws sharp battle lines with Hillary Clinton, given Penceâ€™s reputation as a crusader against abortion, gay rights and Planned Parenthood. Dawn Laguens, executive   of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said on Thursday: â€œA   ticket should send a shiver down the spine of women in this country. Donald Trump just sent a message to the women of America: your health and your lives are not important. â€ Two of Penceâ€™s favorite lines are to describe himself as â€œa Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,â€ and to offer assurance, â€œIâ€™m a conservative, but Iâ€™m not angry about it. â€ He became a born again Christian  â€”   and a born again Republican  â€”   while at university. â€œFor me it all begins with faith it begins with what matters most, and I try and put what I believe to be moral truth first,â€ he told the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 2010. â€œMy philosophy of government second. And my politics third. â€ He had grown up as a Democrat idolising John F Kennedy and still owns a box of Kennedy memorabilia. He explained: â€œIt may be that I grew up in a big Irish Catholic family like he did. Maybe it was that my grandparents were so proud of the first Irish Catholic president. â€ But Ronald Reaganâ€™s economic philosophy led him to convert. Trump himself has been registered as both a Democrat and Republican and voted for both parties over the years. He has contradicted himself on guns, abortion and other social issues. He once raised questions about his biblical knowledge by referring to â€œTwo Corinthiansâ€ rather than â€œSecond Corinthiansâ€. The devout Pence could be a useful antidote. An early advocate of the Tea Party movement, he has voted with social conservatives for nearly his entire time in office, putting him more in line with the far right of the Republican party. He is also seen as a potential asset on the Trump ticket because he is trusted by   conservatives. But first and foremost, Pence mitigates Trumpâ€™s lack of experience in office. The father of three is a political veteran who has served as both governor and member of Congress. He also has close ties to billionaire donors Charles and David Koch, including current and   who have worked for them.  His political career began with two unsuccessful bids for Congress after he graduated from law school. Like Trump, Pence was able to help his political career with a stint in the media. He hosted The Mike Pence Show, eventually syndicated on 18 stations  â€”   he called himself â€œRush Limbaugh on decafâ€  â€”   then a weekend TV show in Indianapolis. This was credited with improving Penceâ€™s name recognition enough to help him win a seat in Congress in November 2000. He represented his   Indiana hometown for 12 years in Congress. He served one term in House leadership as chair of the Republican caucus and launched a failed effort to challenge John Boehner for Republican leader in 2006. Pence built up a reliably conservative record, particularly on social issues  â€”   he opposed gay marriage  â€”   and was considered a rising star within the caucus. But there will be some wrinkles to iron out with Trump. He has publicly disagreed with the billionaire businessman on at least two major issues: free trade and Muslim immigration. He has backed the   Partnership, which is supported by Barack Obama and which Trump has called a â€œrapeâ€ of the US, for instance, and derided Trumpâ€™s call to bar Muslims from entering the US. â€œCalls to ban Muslims from entering the US are offensive and unconstitutional,â€ he tweeted in December. Pence was, however, one of several governors who tried in vain to prevent Syrian refugees from coming to their state. He has also voted to restrict Medicare rules, and in favor of the war in Iraq. Trump broadly supports an aggressive stance toward pharmaceutical companies, and Trump has renounced his original support for the Iraq war by claiming he never supported it. The governorâ€™s   marriage  â€”   he and wife Karen have three adult children  â€”   also contrasts with the decades of tabloid coverage devoted to Trumpâ€™s three marriages and alleged liaisons. The decision to add Pence to the ticket could help Trump persuade dissenters who would have preferred the    brand of candidates like Ted Cruz, whom Pence endorsed just before the Indiana primary, comparing him with Reagan as a â€œprincipled conservativeâ€. Pence was elected governor of his home state in 2012, but first gained national repute for signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015. The controversial law allowed businesses to use religious freedom as an affirmative defence in lawsuits, and was seen as a sanction for people with religious objections to decline services for   couples. After national outrage from critics who saw the law as a step towards legal discrimination, Pence pushed for revisions to make clear that businesses do not have the right to deny service to customers. Instead, it kept the focus on the lawâ€™s mandate that Indiana could not put a â€œsubstantial burdenâ€ on the ability of a legal person to follow their religious beliefs. Penceâ€™s retreat left few satisfied. Many on the left were angered by his initial support of the act, while social conservatives were dismayed by what they saw as a surrender to political pressure.  The religious freedom law was not Penceâ€™s only brush with national controversy. He enacted one of Indianaâ€™s largest cuts to state income tax, and briefly tried to create a   news outlet that would make stories available to local newspapers. He was quickly accused of trying to create a propaganda outlet for his administration, and he ended the initiative. Earlier this year, Pence signed a law that made Indiana only the second state in the union to ban abortions because the foetus has a disability. It is likely to be challenged in court.

politifact15241,http://www.unseen-pedia.com/citizens-want-receive-gvt-benefits-must-agree-microchipped-near-future/,All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future,"The man at the center of the US Senateâ€™s landmark investigation of the CIA torture program has gone public for the first time about an experience that led to the CIA spying on him as part of what he calls a â€œfailed coverupâ€. For six years, Daniel Jones was the chief investigator for the Senate intelligence committeeâ€™s inquiry into CIA detentions and interrogations carried out in the    Bush era. Jones and his team turned 6. 3m pages of internal CIA documents into a scathing study which concluded that torture was ineffective and that the CIA had lied about it to two presidents, Congress and the US public.  But before Jonesâ€™s investigation was released in December 2014, the CIA searched through Senate files on a shared, firewalled network that had been set up by the agency for Jones and his team to securely receive classified documents.  The CIA accessed Jonesâ€™s work and even reconstructed his emails, sparking an unprecedented clash between the agency and its legislative overseers on Capitol Hill.  Jones has broken his silence in an extensive series of interviews with the Guardian, expressing dissatisfaction with what he called a lack of accountability for torture at the CIA. He also says the agency, under the leadership of John Brennan was abetted in trying to silence criticism by Barack Obama, the president who banned torture as one of the first acts of his tenure. â€œPeople who played a significant role in this program, who are in the report, continue to play significant roles in sensitive programs at the agency,â€ said Jones, a former FBI   analyst. â€œTo me, itâ€™s a huge lost opportunity. Hereâ€™s an administration that came in and did all the right things within a few days, shutting down the program   â€¦     We were just never given a fair airing. No one from the White House would be briefed by us. They were briefed by the CIA. â€  Guardian US has   the   saga of the torture inquiry, whose work was eventually published in a   summary. The examination of events between 2008 and 2014 relies upon interviews with people involved and declassified documents concerning both the use of torture and the network breach, which committee member Senator Ron Wyden flatly calls â€œspying on our staffâ€. The Guardianâ€™s findings, to be published in three installments starting today, include: â€¢ How Jones was so afraid the CIA would destroy important evidence, that he covertly removed from a CIA location a classified document, later described as a â€œsmoking gunâ€ by a senator on the committee  â€¢ A decision that left the investigation of extradjudicial transfers of terror suspects into the hands of foreign intelligence services practically lost to history  â€¢ One of Obamaâ€™s most senior aides insisted the Senate obscure a finding that some CIA interrogators who operated at black sites around the world after   had been accused of domestic abuse and even sexual assault, â€¢ Senators were prepared to suppress the report amid national security concerns, until intelligence chief James Clapper provided the committee with a â€œfarceâ€ of an analysis predicting that its publication would lead to chaos and violence around the world. Asked about the   spying episode, agency spokesman Ryan Trapani said: â€œCIA considered this a very serious matter and believed it was important to get to the bottom of what happened. â€ â€œWhat the president has made abundantly clear is that some of the techniques described in the committeeâ€™s report were inconsistent with our values as a nation, which is why one of his first acts in office was to sign an executive order that brought an end to the program and prohibited the use of harsh interrogation techniques,â€ said Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council. The new revelations about torture and the Senate inquiry come at a time when the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, has pledged to require the CIA to perform â€œa hell of a lot worse than waterboardingâ€ on terrorism suspects.  As the Obama administrationâ€™s various cabinet agencies have not even opened the full   classified version of the report, critics fear that a government unwilling to grapple with the torture program will at some point return to it.  â€œThe deeper, more endemic problem lies in a CIA, assisted by a White House, that continues to try to cover up the truth. I worry that an agency that has yet to acknowledge these mistakes could continue to make them under a new administration,â€ said Mark Udall, a former Democratic senator on the committee.  Jones, now a consultant in Washington for the Daschle Group and his own Penn Quarter Group, said that one of the reportâ€™s shocking findings was that the CIA misled not just George W Bush on torture, but also Obama. â€œThis is John Brennanâ€™s CIA, Obamaâ€™s CIA,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™re providing inaccurate information to the president of the United States in the present day. â€ ",152,174,"901649250395803648	901651654809812993	901652522313457664	901827774561779712	901857716615962625	901984094963122178	902101257971793920	902157003459584000	902206072844279808	902683798218973184	902721421322878976	903828005453254656	950205982294138880	952283596810870786	952322272076890113	952402478372339712	952419459653885952	952578964618399744	952585878194368512	952656314651627521	952666094573117441	952682162637086721	952713913560334336	953433678927056896	953455701619367936	953945487018811392	953945492580438016	953964464197353475	953992955353710593	954093353469136897	954337361596506113	958551199619342336	959130560781266944	959130578611331073	965072844030853120	965072913958359040	965345279951155202	973326868656148483	973591283204845570	973629005520830465	973739738871009280	973773061559332864	973800106960084994	973866045894201345	973892583310184448	973899934645870592	973912847284490241	973979435379634176	974070224554221568	974288382925959168	974392957599207432	974425761733120000	974449899621244928	974462971698143232	974565371368951808	974664035114287105	974680566527418368	974818243654205440	974863342140522496	974891312184004608	975213182796124160	975374665341423617	975466553415258112	975488721071083522	975533758576144384	975741761904574464	975742211299135488	975788426195857408	975817207346352131	975867502570934274	975891539917287424	975897407790698496	975905407788085248	976427705196601350	976818446288740352	976870695601868801	977164914304475137	977282346553573381	977601452502913027	977687301684912128	977904205385076736	979864505776619521	980144457315225600	980483801884385280	980492098163032065	980604719444918272	980960820699062272	981028784957771776	981215647320498177	981481949968596992	982576313658589185	983112864675385345",fake
politifact15427,http://www.cvikas.com/2018/05/22/usa-mysterious-nazi-submarine-from-wwii-discovered-in-great-lakes/,USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes!,"â€œAs a general rule,â€ it was written in the 1920s, â€œNegroes have not been and are not thought of in America when you talk in general terms of Americans unless they are specifically pointed out. â€ This â€œgeneral forgetfulnessâ€ therefore made it â€œnecessary for those interested in fair play to all citizensâ€ to propose a â€œbeautiful buildingâ€ to â€œdepict the negroâ€™s contribution to America in military service, in art, literature, invention, science, industry etc. â€ The text was part of a   campaign, started by black civil war veterans in 1915, that will reach its fulfilment on Saturday, when Barack Obama formally opens the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC. It describes with some precision what has finally been achieved. It also suggests what the museumâ€™s director, Lonnie Bunch, says over and over: that the museum should give â€œa fuller understanding of what it means to be Americanâ€ seen through the â€œparticular lensâ€ of black experiences and contributions, not a place that is just about and for an anthropologically defined category known as African Americans. The moment, of course, is charged. A short walk away another building has opened in the heart of the federal administrative district: the   Trump International hotel, a possible encampment on the way to the White House for the man keen on the plainly racist fantasy that Obama was not really   and who as a young property tycoon was accused of denying homes to black applicants. Trumpâ€™s combinations of obfuscation, cunning, bluster and force follow a pattern seen across the centuries in the museumâ€™s accounts of the ways in which black freedom and advancement were blocked. The museum, the 19th to be created by the Smithsonian Institution, enacts further principles currently under attack, which are the importance of knowledge and fact, scrupulously gathered, and of shared spaces for their understanding. It is much for a single building and its contents to carry, especially one placed on the National Mall in Washington amid the icons of the nation  â€”   the White House, the Capitol, great museums, memorials to wars and presidents. â€œHow does one compete with such a monumental landscape?â€ asks David Adjaye, the lead designer of an architectural team formed out of four practices for the purpose of this project called Freelon Adjaye  . This team is led by people of predominantly African American heritage, a rarity in the still very white profession of architecture, such as the lead architect Phil Freelon and the project leader Zena Howard. J Max Bond, a pioneer among black architects, was part of the group but died before the museum was finished. Adjaye is British, born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents. The theme and content of the museum is therefore personal. â€œAs a young boy of my generation the African American story was also our story,â€ says Adjaye, who was born as the civil rights movement was gathering force in 1966, â€œin the sense that it was the techniques, the motivation, it was a way of being and it was a way of understanding that one could succeed in the modern world and not be oppressed by it. I feel it as part of my emerging into adulthood and being who I am. â€ It is indeed the content that should come before the architecture of the building that serves it. It includes artefacts of desperation and sheer survival, such as the shards of tools used by Maroons  â€”   escaped slaves  â€”   in their refuge in the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina. Also of violence, such as leg irons, and fragments of glass from the 1963 bombing that killed four young girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. There is exaltation, in the form of one of Chuck Berryâ€™s bright red Cadillacs, of the recollected triumphs of Muhammad Ali, of the orange silk jacket and recorded singing of the contralto Marian Anderson. There is abundant film and photography of the struggles and grotesqueries of racial politics, such as the Ku Klux Klan march through Washington in 1925. Scraps of intimacy and poverty are interspersed with larger structures, such as wooden cabins inhabited by slaves and a watchtower from Angola prison in Louisiana. Objects of American transport technology contribute: a segregated railway carriage, a bright    biplane used by the African American Tuskegee airmen, that Cadillac. Eventually you find the   Mothership, a spoof spacecraft that used to land on stage on the 1970s stadium tours of George Clinton and his band  . The collection is remarkable for the fact that, little more than a decade ago, it didnâ€™t exist. Lonnie Bunch, on taking up his post in 2005, was armed with a   act of Congress that supported the idea of the museum, but he had nothing to put in it. This could have been catastrophic, as the world is full of unconvincing museums founded on ideas but little content. So Bunch and his team toured the nation, inviting people to offer whatever they might have. The result is personal, eclectic, touching and surprising, rather than encyclopedic. The displays are sometimes overcrowded but avoid gimmicks and pointless gestures at interaction. They are   partly to fill the gaps that arise from the nature of the collection, with a measured and sober tone. The exhibits are arranged in three main sections, starting with a narrative history, rising up from the bottom of a deep basement, that runs from the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade in   Africa and Europe to the presidency of Barack Obama. On two upper floors, above the ground level entrance hall, are the community galleries, which talk about such things as religion, place, sport and military service, and the culture galleries, which show art, music, literature and performance. The museum thus climbs from slave ships to the mothership, an ascendant trajectory that maybe doesnâ€™t do enough to avoid an oversimplified story of oppression ultimately redeemed by blues, funk and  . The museum nonetheless does an outstanding job of giving due weight to horrors and heroism, to people just living their lives and to the endless repeating stories of creativity prompted by oppression. Many of the histories are familiar even to   such as that of Rosa Parks, but they are shown here with new weight. You are assailed by the mental force of something pushing from the back of your mind to the front. Was segregation really so cruel, so laughably hypocritical, so absurdly rigged and transparently unfair? Yes, it was. The official story of the design is already much told and doubtless will be repeated to the museumâ€™s visitors for as long as it stands. The   superstructure of inverted truncated pyramids recalls the celebratory headpieces on certain Yoruba sculptures from west Africa and can also evoke, if you like, arms raised in celebration. They are made of   aluminium whose filigree patterns derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston. A long, deep canopy that shelters the main entrance refers to the porches of southern houses that acted as social and political centres, little village halls, informal schools. These narratives are necessary, says Adjaye, for a project that was â€œdefinitely not done quietly on a mountain somewhere on my ownâ€ but had to â€œnegotiate a lot of positions and opinions to get this form. So it was really important that this was neither cloaked nor hidden. It was something that had to be absolutely clear and people had to understand why. â€ But such stories only get a building so far. They could describe an exhilarating work or a   one. What matters more are the relationships the architecture makes through its space and material between exhibits, people and surroundings. Here there are tensions between the institutional nature of a museum and its popular ambitions, between a search for authenticity and the tendency of modern museums to resemble shopping malls  â€”   shiny, escalatored  â€”   driven as they are by   considerations of people moving and browsing. The design also has to deal with the contemporary habit of putting exhibitions in sealed boxes, where air and light are perfectly controlled, which makes for abrupt transitions with the rest of the world. One technique that Adjaye tries is to create moments of   charm  â€”   a particular tone of purplish pink terrazzo in the entrance hallâ€™s floor, coppery panels on the lifts, outbreaks of decoration as in an art deco cinema, something as simple as the rich blue over the entrance to the Oprah Winfrey theatre. There is an agile open loop of a spiral staircase going down to the basement, which also helps you forget that  â€”   because of restrictions on the   volume of buildings on the National Mall  â€”   60% of the museum is buried. You might imagine something   in these hues and motifs, but at any rate they are different from the greys and creams of most Smithsonian museums. More substantially the building seeks to connect with its august surroundings, through views from decks outside the upper galleries that are sometimes filtered through the filigree screens and sometimes through openings specially oriented to particular monuments. The   ground floor allows views in all directions of both greenery and   official architecture. At this point it feels embracing and inclusive. The hardest job the design has to do is to find a way to stand on its grand stage. It is placed at a corner where the grand axis emanating from the Capitol intersects at a right angle with that emanating from the White House, a cross pinned at its centre by the 555ft obelisk of the Washington monument. All around are white stone commemorations of white men, albeit often built with black labour. As a freestanding largely symmetrical object, the new museum has something in common with its neighbours, but as a   structure that eschews classical columns for apparently floating horizontal layers, it does not. Its suggestion of pyramids gives a geometrical echo of the obelisk (which, lest we forget, is Egyptian and therefore also African) but their inversion sets them apart. Adjaye doesnâ€™t mind if a link is made between the dark skin of the building and that of the people it remembers, but he gives another reason for it. If it is not the main material for buildings on the National Mall, bronze is nonetheless used for the memorial detail of statuary and plaques. The role of the new museum is itself partly memorial, the idea having started off a century ago with the primary intent of honouring black soldiers. The bronze finish, for Adjaye, is â€œabsolutely from the classical family, but to express different ideas seemed like the right thing to doâ€. It takes some nerve to do a building like this, on this spot, and the design is confident enough to pull it off. It is not flawless, as it sometimes feels assembled or panellised more than crafted. The   screens are not the delicate, seamless things suggested in computer visualisations. The   of the exterior cladding  â€”   glass wall plus screen plus substantial fixings for the latter  â€”   impedes the sense of connection between inside and out. There are moments of gawkiness that can be engaging or uncomfortable, depending on your taste. But it achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American, and to be of its location but also different from it. As a museum and as a building it enacts the tone that is so striking in the 1928 text  â€”   its patience, reason and lack of rancour. It realises qualities of America at its best, ones which, as is now abundantly clear, we canâ€™t take for granted. The new National Museum of African American History and Culture is the result of more than a century of efforts to commemorate the contributions of African Americans to their country. 1915 A group of civil war veterans, gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of its ending, organise a â€œcommittee of colored citizensâ€ to build a monument. 1929 Congress permits a national commission to be set up, but it fails for lack of funding. 1968 Black leaders unsuccessfully press Congress for a museum. 1985 The owner of a   company, Tom Mack, starts a fundraising group. 1988 Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights veteran, unsuccessfully introduces a bill for a museum. He continues this battle for 15 years. 1994 A proposal to create a museum within a wing of an existing Smithsonian institution, already controversial because of its lack of ambition, is defeated. Republican senator Jesse Helms opposes it: â€œHow can Congress then say no to Hispanics,â€ he says, â€œand the next group, and the next group after that?â€ 2003 After bipartisan pressure George Bush signs legislation creating the National Museum of African American History and Culture. 2005 Lonnie Bunch is appointed director. The museum has a staff of two, no collection, no confirmed site, and needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. He launches Saving African American Treasures, a programme to encourage citizens to donate objects. 2006 A site is selected on the National Mall, Washington DC, the last of any size to remain undeveloped. 2009 Following the election of President Barack Obama, a team of architects is selected. 2016 The museum, designed by a team led by David Adjaye, is completed at a total cost of $540m.

politifact13541,http://freedomdaily.com/obama-led-u-n-has-just/,BREAKING ObamaLed UN Has Just Made It Official US To Immediately Pay Blacks ‘Reparations’,"Climate scientists have denounced the House committee on science, space and technology after the   panel promoted a misleading story expressing skepticism that the earth is dangerously warming. On Thursday afternoon, the committee tweeted a Breitbart article alleging: â€œGlobal Temperatures Plunge. Icy Silence from Climate Alarmistsâ€. The story linked to a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, which claimed that global land temperatures were plummeting, and that humans were not responsible for years of steadily increasing heat. The Daily Mail story cited â€œNasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphereâ€ without specifics, exaggerated the degree of the fall and left out three important points of context: how El NiÃ±o systems affect oceans and atmosphere, how ocean temperatures are rising, and the clear upward pattern of    changes. â€œTheyâ€™re not serious articles,â€ said Adam Sobel, a Columbia University climate scientist. â€œThey paint it as though itâ€™s an argument between Breitbart and Buzzfeed when itâ€™s an argument between a snarky Breitbart blogger and the entire worldâ€™s scientific community, and the overwhelming body of scientific evidence. â€  Sobel said the articles â€œgrossly misinterpretâ€ a few accurate details, for instance that El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a systems play a large role in   fluctuations. â€œThe temperature goes up for a couple of years and we have the largest year on record, then it goes down and it reaches a level thatâ€™s still well above   historical averages,â€ he said. â€œThat in no way disproves anything about the causes of the   temperature trends. â€ Sobel called the committeeâ€™s use of Breitbart â€œdistressingâ€. â€œIf the House science committee wants to understand science they should talk to climate scientists. â€ Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, noted that 2016 would soon be the hottest year on record, â€œby a substantial marginâ€ over 2015, which took the record from 2014.  â€œThree consecutive   warm years, something weâ€™ve never seen before, and a reminder of the profound and deleterious impact that our profligate burning of fossil fuels is having on the planet,â€ he told the Guardian. â€œFor anyone, least of all the House committee on science, to at this particular moment be promoting fake news aimed at fooling the public into thinking otherwise, can only be interpreted as a deliberate effort to distract and fool the public. â€ Promoting the articles, Mann said, â€œis beneath the dignity of anyone holding higher officeâ€. â€œThis is an astounding example of   the data,â€ said Kerry Emanuel, a professor at MIT. â€œGlobal land temperatures fluctuate significantly from one month to the next, and the article in question appears to have   a drop on global land temperatures (not including the ocean, which covers 70% of the globe) for a single month. â€ Emanuel left politics to the committee, adding: â€œYou may draw your own conclusions as to motives. â€ On their blog, a prominent climate writer who goes by the pseudonym Tamino, was less circumspect, saying the articles insulted readers by denying the melting ice, rising sea levels and floods and increased droughts around the world. â€œHow stupid does he think you are?â€ A spokesperson for the committee did not return emails or phone calls requesting comment about whether anyone vetted the articles. Since 2010, the Republican chairman of the committee, Lamar Smith, has written five   for Breitbart, the   website with a record of denying climate change and racist and misogynistic writing. A spokesman for Smith, Nick Cartwright, said â€œthere is not a relationshipâ€ between the congressman and the site.  The former chairman of Breitbart, Steve Bannon, was named by   Donald Trump as his â€œchief strategistâ€ in the Republicanâ€™s incoming administration.  Democrats on the committee berated their colleagues for the tweet, with ranking member EB Johnson saying it reflected a longer trend of   action. Republicans, she said, had â€œattempted to intimidate NOAAâ€™s scientists over climate change research results that they didnâ€™t like, put forth a Nasa bill that gutted Earth science, and continuously attacked any effort on the part of the administration to deal with climate changeâ€. â€œThis isnâ€™t factual, itâ€™s embarrassing, and Breitbart is not a credible news source,â€ wrote representative Don Beyer. â€œWe need to bring *science* back to the Science Committee . â€ Representative Zoe Lofgren wrote: â€œSign these guys up for the flat earth society. â€  Senator Bernie Sanders, who has said he intends to fight Republicans who would dismantle climate change measures, mocked the committee by alluding to the  â€™s defunct real estate school, which closed and was accused of fraud. â€œWhereâ€™d you get your PhD?â€ Sanders asked. â€œTrump University?â€ Several leading Republicans on the committee did not reply to requests for comment.  Democrats and Republicans each have their own teams of staffers for the committee, but share a news clipping service for providing information to elected officials. Since their party holds a majority in the House, the Republican team controls the search terms for what news clips are culled, said Kristen Kopshever, a spokeswoman for the Democratsâ€™ office. â€œItâ€™s constantly like the the Daily Caller and Texas GOP Vote Blog and just these random conservative publications that have made it into our clips,â€ she said. Kopshever echoed the representatives, noting that Smith had aggressively pursued investigations: intervening in a fraud case against ExxonMobil and the inquiry into Hillary Clintonâ€™s email server, for instance. Kopshever said her office tried to rely on apolitical sources, such as Science Magazine and the academic journal Nature, and that she could not speak for her Republican counterparts. â€œI donâ€™t know what their process is,â€ she said. â€œWe donâ€™t work a lot together. â€",986,250,,fake
politifact14503,https://yournewswire.com/irma-destroy-new-york-city/,Computer Models Show IRMA Destroying New York City On Sept. 10,"A Connecticut judge ruled on Friday that a group of families cannot hold gun companies liable for manufacturing, distributing or selling the    rifle used to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012. The gun companies are protected by a 2005 federal law designed to shield gun companies from liability when their products are misused by criminals, Connecticut superior court judge Barbara Bellis ruled, granting the gun companiesâ€™ motion to strike the case.  The Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, has pledged to repeal this 2005 law if elected. Clintonâ€™s campaign has argued that the law â€œlets gun manufacturers and dealers act without consequenceâ€ and that â€œending the gun industryâ€™s legal immunity is an important step in tackling the epidemic of gun violence in this countryâ€. Gun rights advocates and gun companies say the law, which protects gun companies from liability â€œfor the harm purely caused by criminal or unlawful use of firearm productsâ€ is common sense and shields the industry from politically motivated attacks.  The Bushmaster   rifle used in the 2012 school shooting had been legally purchased by shooter Adam Lanzaâ€™s mother. Lanza shot and killed her before driving to a local elementary school and murdering dozens of people.  Clinton championed the Sandy Hook families involved in the lawsuit earlier this year as part of a series of attacks on her then opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, who had voted in favor of the law. But her campaign said at the time that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act ensured that the familiesâ€™ chance of success in the case was â€œslimâ€. â€œWhile the families are obviously disappointed with the judgeâ€™s decision, this is not the end of the fight. We will appeal this decision immediately and continue our work to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening,â€ Josh Koskoff, one of the lawyers representing the Sandy Hook families, said in a statement on Friday.  The defendants in the lawsuit include Bushmaster, the company that made the rifle Camfour, a firearms distributor and Riverview Gun Sales, the store where the gun was bought. According to court filings, Bushmaster merged into Remington Arms, which is also named in the lawsuit, in 2011. Both companies are part of the Freedom Group, which calls itself â€œthe worldâ€™s leading innovator, designer, manufacturer and marketer of firearmsâ€. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does not shield gun companies and dealers from all legal liability. They can still be sued over defective products, if they break the laws governing gun sales, and for â€œnegligent entrustmentâ€ or selling the gun to someone who would obviously misuse it. To get around the shield law, lawyers for the Sandy Hook families had tried to argue that the manufacturer, distributor and dealer were all â€œnegligentâ€ to market and sell powerful   weapons to civilians. The Connecticut judge rejected this argument. Agreeing with the Sandy Hook familiesâ€™ legal theory â€œwould imply that the general public lacks the ordinary prudence to handle an object that Congress regards as appropriate for sale to the general public. This the court is unwilling to do,â€ the judge ruled. Millions of Americans own   which are one of the most popular styles of consumer rifles in America. FBI data suggests that only 3. 55% of all gun murders are committed with any type of rifle. Most gun murders are committed with handguns. â€œRemington is pleased with the courtâ€™s decision today to strike the plaintiffâ€™s complaint,â€ Remington lawyer James Vogts said. â€œWe are pleased that the court has dismissed the case based on the PLCAA,â€ Larry Keane, the general counsel to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industryâ€™s trade group, said in a statement. â€œThis law passed Congress over a dozen years ago by a broad bipartisan margin. It does not provide â€˜blanket immunityâ€™ as some have claimed. It merely bars lawsuits that seek to hold manufacturers and dealers responsible for the criminal misuse of legal,   products that were lawfully sold. â€ Among the family members that filed the lawsuit against the gun companies were Mark and Jackie Barden, who lost their    son, Daniel Nicole and Ian Hockley, who lost their    son, Dylan and Bill Sherlach, who lost his wife, Mary, the schoolâ€™s psychologist. When Jackie Barden researched the gun used to kill her son, she was shocked at the military language and images Bushmaster used to market its weapons. â€œConsider your man card reissued,â€ one ad read, with a photo of a black rifle. â€œForces of opposition, bow down,â€ read another. â€œHere you have this machine that was designed for use by the military being sold to civilians, to untrained civilians, with aggressive military battlefield language,â€ her husband, Mark, told the Guardian in April. â€œAnd guess what? History has shown that these people who are suicidal, disturbed individuals who are bent on killing large numbers of people  â€”   thatâ€™s the weapon they choose. â€ Several parents involved with the lawsuit said they thought gun companiesâ€™ marketing made the weapons more attractive to disturbed, violent young men like the one who killed their children. â€œThere were a lot of guns that our shooter could have chosen from his arsenal and his motherâ€™s arsenal,â€ Nicole Hockley said at a press conference in February. â€œHe chose the  . He was aware of how many shots it could get out, how lethal it was, how it would serve his objective of killing as many people as possible in as short a time as possible . .. and the manufacturers need to be held responsible for that. â€ Family members said they knew the lawsuit would be an uphill battle. They were told early on that â€œgun manufacturers are untouchableâ€ Jackie Barden said. Gun control groups criticized the decision and said PLCAA â€œinfringedâ€ on victimsâ€™ rights. â€œClaiming to protect one right, the gun lobby has infringed on another: the right to have your day in court,â€ Robyn Thomas, the executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement. â€œThe dismissal of the Newtown familiesâ€™ case doesnâ€™t mean their claims lack merit  â€”   it means that our system is rigged in favor of the gun industry and our leaders refuse to hold the manufacturers of deadly weapons of war accountable for the carnage they wreak in our communities, on our streets, and even in our   classrooms. PLCAA is a disgrace that Congress must repeal. â€",314,535,"903822618134020097	903845876828917761	903858932149501952	903874178847195138	903895286384271362	903900020398727168	903991561037389824	903998226440781824	904006015409991680	904048984649596933	904103166945447936	905218606593708033	905222946444193792	905225407925862400	905226475846205440	905227940924936192	905234010296733698	905236246221475840	905239333074075653	905241199358836736	905247321478369280	905249445641560065	905306966897164288	905372275276267520	905372324811112449	905374759868825600	905382840401104897	905441132288585730	905442454924435457	905475536381718528	905512000335306753	905540976281739264	905541260206678016	905558328205602816	905558921791844352	905677084307054592	905777541239189504	905997443627491328	906199429870477314	906280350007132161	906280374006943744	956390810282528768",fake

Anticipating the end of Obamacare, coverage for birth control, perhaps even abortion, a lot of women started to think about   contraception and talking about their options online. With social media, getting involved is easier than ever. And with Trump â€”   the most overtly misogynist politician in history  â€”   in office, we have our work cut out for us.

politifact14471,https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320/http://ourlandofthefree.com:80/2017/08/remember-this-lunatic/,BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis,"The telecoms giant ATT has agreed to pay $85bn to buy the media powerhouse Time Warner and create one of the worldâ€™s largest media, TV and telecoms firms. The boards of the two companies unanimously approved the deal on Saturday. ATT will pay $107. 50 per Time Warner share, in a combination of cash and stock, worth $85. 4 billion overall.  The deal, which combines Americaâ€™s   wireless telecoms company with the owner of HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Brothers movies, is likely to face tough regulatory scrutiny due to fears it could lead to less consumer choice and higher prices. If approved, the deal would be the biggest in the world this year.  ATTâ€™s CEO, Randall Stephenson, says he does not anticipate government blocking the acquisition, which the company says is expected to go through by the end of 2017. Time Warnerâ€™s CEO, Jeff Bewkes, says he expects all of his companyâ€™s creative and business executives to stay on â€œfor a number of yearsâ€.  The Republican presidential nominee said on Saturday he would block the deal if he were elected. In a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump said ATTâ€™s purchase of Time Warner would give the combined group â€œtoo much concentration of powerâ€ and would â€œdestroy democracyâ€.  Speaking about his continuing battle with the â€œdishonest mainstream mediaâ€ Trump said: â€œTheyâ€™re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people. â€œAs an example of the power structure Iâ€™m fighting, ATT is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because itâ€™s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. â€ Trump said he would also consider â€œbreakingâ€ up the last big media deal, Comcastâ€™s acquisition of NBC Universal in 2013. â€œDeals like this destroy democracy,â€ he said. Telecoms companies are increasingly seeking to buy into cable TV providers and content producers, in order to offer more extensive packages to consumers. ATT spent $48bn buying the satellite TV provider DirecTV last year, making it the countryâ€™s largest   provider, with 25 million customers. The company has also spent hundreds of millions improving its infrastructure to give consumers a better experience watching video content on their mobile phones.  Buying Time Warner would give ATT, which has a market value of $226bn, access to the Harry Potter and Batman film franchises as well as hit TV shows such as The Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones.  The rival telecoms company Verizon is in negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of the Huffington Post. The   Warner deal vindicates Bewkesâ€™s, decision to turn down a $   takeover approach from 21st Century Fox two years ago. Shares in Time Warner jumped 8% to $89. 48 on Friday, when speculation about the proposed deal was first reported. Brian Wieser, lead researcher at the analytics firm Pivotal, said the deal would present the new entity with potentially insurmountable difficulties. Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at first look similar to the successful Comcast, following its purchase of NBC Universal, an   Warner entity would present unique challenges. Other entities, he said, made more sense for the    Time Warner.  â€œDirecTV and Time Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and ATT,â€ he said. â€œIt looks like a hedge against the commoditization of infrastructure. â€   telecoms companies such as ATT are facing a crisis as their wireless businesses reach maturity and   income continues to erode. â€œATT is an acquisition machine and interested in empire preservation if nothing else,â€ said Wieser.  â€œTime Warner has always been for sale at the right price. Itâ€™s not a position that creates any synergies and it does create some   like the problem of managing a global media company from Texas. Itâ€™s a standalone entity that gets lost when itâ€™s part of a much bigger conglomerate. â€ ATT faces tough choices, said Wieser: â€œIf the prospects for wireline growth are negative and the prospects for wireless growth tepid, what do you do to make sure your business grows?â€  Time Warner, too, faces problems. The trend of â€œ â€  â€”   people getting TV over the internet  â€”   has eaten into the cable subscriptions that are vital to its networks.  There is also increasing competition from players such Netflix, Amazon Prime and Googleâ€™s YouTube. In August, Time Warner bought a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu.",792,337,"639632076153602049	639987717707722752	907801744368959488",fake
politifact15370,https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/europe/queen-last-corgi-dead-intl/index.html,"Last in Queen Elizabeth II's line of corgis dies, says British press","What does a newly hatched crocodile see while it is being transported to water between its motherâ€™s jaws? How should a wild dog pup behave if it wants to be accepted by an approaching pack of adults? These and other questions will be answered in a new BBC wildlife series screening this week, in which the stars of the show are not only the animals being filmed, but the animatronic â€œspy creaturesâ€ used to film them. Spy in the Wild is the BBCâ€™s first major natural history series since Planet Earth II, but the footage that makes up the   series was captured in a very different way to Sir David Attenboroughâ€™s wildlife spectacular.  Using 30   robotic animals, each concealing miniature cameras,   captured footage they say is among some of the most intimate and revealing to date, showing a range of animal behaviours that appear to demonstrate grief, friendship and even empathy with other species.  As well as allowing unprecedented access to the animals  â€”   including a trip between the jaws of a Ugandan Nile crocodile  â€”   the animatronic creatures were designed to interact with   animals in ways that at times astonished the   according to John Downer, the executive producer. â€œWe began to see that the cameras were not only recording, they were sometimes eliciting behaviour in a way that made you think,â€ he said. â€œYou were having that connection between the spy creature and the animal that you never get with any kind of filming, and so things would develop that you didnâ€™t expect. â€ The first episode, themed around the subject of love, includes one example. In a scene filmed with a troop of langurs living on a temple complex in Rajasthan, a robotic camera, modelled to resemble a young monkey, is believed by the troop to be a baby that has died.  The langurs are seen gathering en masse to surround the motionless â€œbabyâ€ hushing their chatter and hugging each other as if collectively grieving.  The series has been made for the BBC by Downerâ€™s eponymous production company, which has made previous â€œspyâ€ series, including one featuring an early robotic camera concealed in a fake rock, nicknamed â€œbouldercamâ€.  The animals in the new series, developed over months by international teams of roboticists, programmers and artists, have benefitted from huge technological advances since the lumbering boulder.  A camera disguised as a prairie dog, which captures the animalsâ€™ habit of â€œkissingâ€ each other, was programmed with the ability to â€œ â€ a leaping motion that reinforces family bonds.  Similarly, â€œ â€ the wild dog camera, had to be given the ability to make a range of submissive gestures  â€”   including wagging its tail, twitching its ears and performing the respectful â€œplay bowâ€  â€”   in order to win the trust of suspicious adults in the pack. The scientists who study the animals had predicted it would be ripped apart in minutes.  Downer would not disclose the cost of the animatronic creatures, which include a walking crocodile, several mobile tortoises and a female orangutan, but said â€œthey are all obviously pretty expensive, because they require a massive amount of workâ€. In the case of the more sophisticated animals, he said, this could take up to nine months of development per creature.  â€œIn the last episode, which is about misbehaviour, you will see quite a few of our spy creatures destroyed,â€ he said, including a tortoise trampled by a herd of elephants. Their greatest worry was that the creatures were not destroyed when first introduced to the animals, â€œbecause after that they are generally acceptedâ€ he added. Ascribing human emotions to animals used to be frowned upon, said Downer, who began his career with the BBCâ€™s natural history unit, â€œbut thatâ€™s been the great change over the past decade or soâ€.  â€œYou canâ€™t spend any time with animals without realising that in so much of what they do, they are so like us,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s inevitable  â€”   we are animals, so why make that big distinction? To deny it is to fly in the face of what you are seeing. â€",952,403,"986621691915919361	986622673030533122	986622908737949699	986622912919687174	986622938655805440	986622937120653313	986622946792935425	986623027604533253	986623054590570496	986623111297560577	986623151042772992	986623172265979905	986623189521317888	986623401837154304	986623527443976193	986623692330369024	986623745040224256	986623789785067520	986624544071929856	986628246782394368	986628919666270208	986631444201197575	986633747029114880	986635210073788420	986636387930791936	986644344567459842	986650759126224896	986652452165267456	986659428945494016	986689091050893314	986700194849865728	986713286497460226	986729137103605760	986743890228031488	986747394300764161	986748342926389248	986810739116597248	986821220854190080	986887794558631936	986893501689458689	986965185259888640	986968308388741120	986975058508820480	986982419877199875	986992260431732736	986998922051833857	986999319692824576	987005219518275584	987005960764968960	987005982239846400	987009410491912193	987012977273589760	987013993645527040	987026842472407042	987082277229400064	987086533202202624	987096792927006720	987116226748051457	987321887717052416	987672016655437827	987872854472470528	987914667136880640	988161472843927552	988245003372818432	988749515690774529	988980913647247361	990634110908551168	991370936619331585	991482317381259264	1007710690788937728",fake

It was only when they got home that most of his customers realised the box theyâ€™d bought was   or its contents fake. With the money he saved, McDonald managed to establish himself in the Chicago underworld and eventually rose to become the most powerful gambling tycoon in town. Alongside wealth and influence came political control: at the height of his reign in the 1870s and 1880s, â€œKing Mikeâ€ determined the destinies of virtually every elected representative in Chicago, from local ward committeemen to mayors, senators and governors. â€œHe never held office,â€ noted writer Richard Henry Little, â€œbut ruled the city with an iron hand. â€ More than a century later, Chicagoâ€™s reputation for urban corruption  â€”   first established by McDonald, then bolstered by a succession of criminals over subsequent decades, from Al Capone to Rod Blagojevich  â€”   remains intact. Over the last 40 years there have been more than 1, 500 public corruption convictions in Chicagoâ€™s judicial district, more than any other city in the US, and a report published last year by the University of Illinois concluded that the Windy City is still the â€œCapital of Corruptionâ€ in America. But outside of the US, Chicago faces stiff competition. In Colombia, an estimated 1, 380 local mayors have been charged with corruption over an   period. In Ukraine,    of all news reports address corruption issues in urban development. In Spain, the GÃ¼rtel scandal  â€”   involving the alleged bribery of leading politicians by businessmen seeking construction contracts in Madrid and Valencia  â€”   continues to engulf establishment circles, leading 95% of citizens to believe that corruption is institutionalised, although no one has yet been found guilty. In Rio de Janeiro city prosecutors and council members say they are scrutinising Olympic contracts for possible corruption as the investigation continues into the   kickback scheme at Petrobras. So where does Chicagoâ€™s malfeasance rank when set against its global counterparts, and to what extent are court rulings really a useful measure of a cityâ€™s corruption? The answer, of course, depends on how we choose to define urban corruption. There is no simple or universal way of doing this, because the question of what our cities look like when they are corrupted is really just another way of asking a much harder question: what do we want them to look like when they are clean? Cities     by millennia, and the process of urbanisation  â€”   particularly when it occurs quickly, and in places where natural and civic resources are limited  â€”   has always created opportunities for those willing and able to bend the rules. â€œA   and expanding population puts pressure on space, on water, on public services like health and education, and that causes shortages,â€ explains Dieter Zinnbauer, research manager at Transparency International  â€”   an international organisation which aims to combat corruption and is based in Berlin. â€œWhenever you have shortages, you have big corruption risks one has to ask oneself â€˜who are the gatekeepers of these resources, and how are they being allotted?â€™ Of course this can exist in the countryside too, but it plays out in the urban theatre in a more concentrated and drastic way. â€ Those risks are increasing. Over the next 30 or so years, the number of people living in cities is set to grow by an extra 2. 5 billion and the vast majority of that urbanisation will take place in parts of the world where the prevalence of dishonest practices  â€”   corruption of local politics, policing, resource allocation and delivery of services to citizens  â€”   already appears to be high. Transparency Internationalâ€™s Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks nations according to expert perceptions of   corruption, assigns each country a score between 100 (very clean) and 0 (very corrupt). India, China and Nigeria all currently score below 40, indicating a high level of public corruption between them, these three states alone are set to absorb almost a billion new   by 2050. Over the next decade, in terms of new residential and commercial space, India will build the equivalent of an entire Chicago every single year. And yet despite the soaring relevance of cities to our lives, to date global   efforts have largely been targeted at countries as a whole, rather than at the urban settlements within them. The recent Panama Papers exposÃ© drove debates over corruption to the top of the news agenda, and also revealed the extent to which tax havens have a direct impact on cities more than 31, 000 companies based in tax havens own property in the UK, largely concentrated in London, and nearly one in 10 of them are linked to Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the leaks. â€œThe Panama Papers have once more driven home the point that shell companies associated with offshore secrecy providers play an outsized role in the real estate markets of some world cities,â€ argues Zinnbauer. But a major   summit held by David Cameron in the aftermath of the leaks largely ignored the urban dimension. â€œInternationally, thereâ€™s a big focus on macro initiatives and people just hope this will filter down to the city level, but it doesnâ€™t happen like that,â€ says Anga Timilsina, programme manager at the UNDPâ€™s Global   Initiative. â€œItâ€™s an area that needs much more attention. â€ Part of the problem is that identifying which cities are most exposed to corruption is a daunting task although there has been some piecemeal regional research, at the moment there is no standalone corruption index for urban areas that spans the globe. â€œEvery methodology you could possibly use to measure urban corruption has its limitations, and is likely to reveal a certain type of corruption that is pertinent to some corrupt cities but largely unimportant in others,â€ adds Timilsina. â€œHow do you compare apples and pears?â€ Based on the fragmented data that is available though, a few cities do stand out. If we assume a direct correlation between national and   corruption, and restrict ourselves to Transparency Internationalâ€™s metric of asking experts to assess the degree of corruption among public institutions and employees, then it is largely cities in   states  â€”   where normal governance mechanisms have been suspended and delivery of education, healthcare and other municipal services highly disrupted  â€”   that fare worst: Mogadishu in Somalia, Kabul in Afghanistan, and Juba in South Sudan. In Libya and Iraq, which both sit in the bottom 10 of the Corruption Perceptions Index, military conflict is entwined with an abundance of oil reserves, which generates extra incentives for corrupt practices in cities like Tripoli and Baghdad. But there are other ways of thinking about urban corruption, one of which is how robust legal protections for citizens are, and how common it is for them to have to bribe officials on a    basis to get things done. Here, it is cities in Africa and Asia which tend to stand out. The LSEâ€™s New Urban Governance Project, a   research programme which attempts to chart different aspects of city management across the world, lists two Nigerian cities  â€”   Lagos and Port Harcourt  â€”   as places where the risk of corruption is a â€œhighly relevantâ€ governance challenge. According to Global Integrity, a Washington     organisation which tracks international corruption trends and has produced an â€œAfrican Integrityâ€ map, capital cities like Asmara (Eritrea) Nouakchott (Mauritania) and Conakry (Guinea) score particularly poorly on indicators like the rule of law, accountability and civil service integrity.  Indian website ipaidabribe. com, which allows citizens to upload details of   extortion, suggests that Bangalore, Delhi and Hyderabad rank worst for corruption Dhaka, capital of neighbouring Bangladesh, is listed by a number of surveys as one of the places where informal payments for public utilities or business licences are demanded most frequently. Another measure of corruption in cities is the extent to which organised crime or more generalised violence is widespread. Latin American cities dominate the statistics in this area. Caracas recently overtook San Pedro Sula in Honduras to top a list of the worldâ€™s most dangerous cities the Venezuelan capital also makes an appearance on the LSEâ€™s list of cities where corruption risks are highest, and Venezuela itself  â€”   also a major   country  â€”   is listed near the bottom 10 of Transparency Internationalâ€™s Corruption Perceptions Index. Corrupted security agencies often help fuel urban violence in Caracas, police officers have been accused of involvement in eight out of 10 kidnappings. And yet all these figures ignore what is arguably the most important element of corruption in cities: where illicit money flows, and how it is hidden. From embezzlement in Ashgabat to bribery in BogotÃ¡, virtually all forms of corruption can ultimately be traced back to the hijacking of urban public   and civic institutions by vested interests, and the financial bounty reaped by elites has to end up somewhere. That somewhere, overwhelmingly, is the City of London. Britainâ€™s private bankers, largely headquartered in the UK capitalâ€™s square mile  â€”   an institution which is itself shielded from most forms of democratic accountability through an archaic web of legal exemptions and historical conventions (the City is one of the only urban settlements on earth where businesses help elect the areaâ€™s political representatives, and control votes which vastly outnumber those of local residents)  â€”   manage $1. 65 trillion of client assets between them, covering wealth from all over the planet. That money is protected from meaningful oversight through extraordinarily generous laws on tax, trusts, secrecy and domicile status, and a consistently lax enforcement regime. Nicholas Shaxson, author of the book Treasure Islands, which explores tax havens, argues that â€œfinancial services companies have flocked to London because it lets them do what they cannot do at homeâ€. This has led Transparency International itself to label the City of London the worldâ€™s â€œ  home for the fruits of corruptionâ€   journalist Robert Saviano believes the practices of the City have transformed the UK into the most corrupt nation on earth. It is impossible to analyse urban corruption in any form without placing London and its financial industry at the heart of the problem. Via its deregulatory impulses and unparalleled influence on the global economic system, Londonâ€™s financial core has exported the conditions necessary for   corruption to countless other cities around the planet, while at the same time offering a safe haven for corrupt money that makes the job of tackling urban corruption in all those other cities far more difficult.  As cities continue to expand and proliferate, demand for urban land, and thus its value, is set to increase sharply. Dieter Zinnbauer, of Transparency International, believes that we may be moving towards an urban land â€œresource curseâ€  â€”   a phrase normally associated with countries laden with so much mineral wealth that rulers have little need to establish a tax base and thus prove themselves accountable to citizens, but which Zinnbauer fears could soon apply to cities too and be responsible for driving further corruption in the years to come. In Egypt, for example, the improper sale of desert land on Cairoâ€™s fringes by government officials has not only lined the pockets of regime cronies but diverted scant public resources  â€”   drinking water, energy pipelines and transport infrastructure  â€”   to areas of the city where few people live. â€œThe problem isnâ€™t only that rapidly rising land prices allow specific groups to land windfall profits in the â€ Zinnbauer notes, â€œbut also that in the longer run this locks in certain development patterns which potentially deprive large parts of the community of economic opportunities, so it hardwires injustices into the future of the city. â€ Itâ€™s not all bad news. In many cities, concerted fightbacks against corruption have met with some success: the transformation of Colombiaâ€™s second city of MedellÃ­n from murder hotspot to apparent civic beacon made headlines around the world, and in Romania the tireless efforts of   head Laura CodruÅ£a KÃ¶vesi has claimed huge scalps, including the mayor of Bucharest, Sorin Oprescu, who was arrested and stood down last year. Among the global   community, innovative forms of urban planning and design which aim to ensure cities are more responsive to the needs of citizens and make corrupt practices much harder are becoming more prominent. In New York, activists have used   public murals and advertising billboards on the metro to inform residents of their rights in cases of housing eviction or police intimidation, and recently published research in India suggests that workers who display a visible symbol indicating their hostility to corruption are less likely to be asked by colleagues or bosses to engage in malpractice. But such measures will never be enough in isolation. To really root out corruption in our cities, we will need to fight for a different kind of global economic infrastructure, one that does not allow vast quantities of illicit wealth to be siphoned off from public treasuries and vulnerable citizens, only to disappear into the shadows. And for that, those of us who live in London need to turn our attention closer to home. Guardian Cities is a member of the Habitat III Journalism Project.

politifact15341,http://www.patriotnetwork.one/2018/04/27/breaking-czech-republic-arms-citizens-you-can-now-shoot-terrorists-on-sight/,BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT”,"â€œIf our civilisation is to survive,â€ Karl Popper writes at the beginning of this passionate defence of freedom and reason, â€œwe must break with the habit of deference to great men. â€ The Open Society and Its Enemies, conceived in the 1930s, and completed in the 1940s, would become a key text of the 1960s, and its author a profound, sometimes thrilling, influence on a new generation of college students. Thus, a book inspired by the Nazi invasion of Austria in 1938, but actually written in the secluded tranquillity of New Zealandâ€™s South Island, became a rallying cry, on behalf of western liberal democracy, for the postwar renewal of the European tradition. Before the inevitable backlash, Popper, an Ã©migrÃ© intellectual determined to address â€œthe difficulties faced by our civilisationâ€ became a touchstone for progressive opinion. His fierce critique of Plato, Hegel and Marx was understood as an assault on totalitarian thought, and became widely fashionable, even when denounced by dissenting scholars and rivals. At the same time, The Open Society and Its Enemies (published in two volumes: The Spell of Plato and The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx, and the Aftermath) was the product of the philosopherâ€™s own intellectual journey. As a young man, Popper had adopted Marxism, a decision that would seriously influence many of his later ideas. For a few months in 1919 he had even considered himself a communist, becoming quite at home with the orthodoxies of class conflict, and the central tenets of Marxist economics and history. Although he quickly became disillusioned, this youthful flirtation with Marxist ideology would lead him to distance himself from those who believed in violent revolution. Eventually, during the long disillusionment of the 1920s, he came to realise that the sacrifice of human life must be a last resort, and that radical thought and conduct must be exercised with exemplary caution and prudence. Popper was not only dismayed by the failure of democratic parties to prevent fascism from taking over Austrian politics in the 1920s and 1930s, he suffered directly from the consequences of this historic failure. The Nazisâ€™ annexation of Austria, with the Anschluss of 1938, forced the young philosopher into permanent exile. Henceforth, he would devote himself to a lifelong assault on totalitarian thought in general, and Marxism in particular. His philosophical interests also concerned science and the uncertainty of knowledge. Some of his teaching, indeed, would eventually play an important part in the intellectual development of Thomas Kuhn (No 21 in this series). Popper questioned the idea that there were inexorable laws of human history, believing history to be influenced by the growth of knowledge, which is always unpredictable. Popper had first expressed his arguments about science in The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1934) arguing that science proceeds through bold, competing conjectures subjected to rigorous testing. He once said that â€œnext to music and art, science is the greatest, most beautiful and most enlightening achievement of the human spiritâ€. But it was as the sponsor of the idea of â€œthe open societyâ€ and defender of democratic systems, that he became most widely known. The Open Society and Its Enemies, finally published in 1945, has been described as one of the most influential books of the 20th century. As well as popularising the open society, it argued that communism and fascism were philosophically linked, and demonstrated the subtle interconnections of politics and culture: â€œThe contention that Platoâ€™s political programme is purely totalitarian, and the objections to this contention,â€ writes Popper, â€œhave led us to examine the part played, within this programme, by such moral ideas as Justice, Wisdom, Truth and Beauty. â€ In response, Bertrand Russell, an important champion, declared Popperâ€™s work to be â€œa vigorous and profound defence of democracy, timely, interesting and very well writtenâ€. With hindsight, itâ€™s the rhetorical force and clarity of Popperâ€™s writing that is both singular and impressive, and also never less than intensely readable: â€œWho can doubt that Plato reveals here how seriously he was impressed by the creed of the open society, and how hard he had to struggle to come to his senses and to realise where he was  â€”   namely, in the camp of its enemies. â€ In his introduction to a second edition, Popper concedes the degree to which his work was influenced by the second world war: â€œThe fact that most of the book was written during the grave years when the outcome of the war was uncertain may help to explain why some of its criticism [is] more emotional and harsher in tone than I could wish. But it was not time to mince words. â€ Popper claimed heâ€™d never made any explicit reference to the war. Nonetheless, his book â€œwas an attempt to understand those events and their background, and some of the issues which were likely to arise after the war was wonâ€. In the spirit of the cold war, and the political climate in which The Open Society and Its Enemies was first being read, Popper did not hesitate to declare Marxism â€œa major problemâ€ and just â€œone of the many mistakes we have made in the perennial and dangerous struggle for building a better and freer worldâ€. Accordingly, Popper did not hesitate to identify â€œthe darkness of the present world situationâ€ claiming this to be his justification for his â€œsevere treatment of Marxâ€. From the perspective of 2016, much of Popperâ€™s polemic seems almost as remote as medieval theology. Contingency and the zeitgeist will always have an important role to play in the making of such nonfiction classics. Popperâ€™s conclusion remains at once radical, and deeply conservative: â€œOur greatest troubles spring from something that is as admirable and sound as it is dangerous  â€”   from our impatience to better the lot of our fellows. These troubles are the   of what is perhaps the greatest of all moral and spiritual revolutions of history, a movement which began three centuries ago. It is the longing of uncounted unknown men to free themselves and their minds from the tutelage of authority and prejudice. It is their attempt to build up an open society . .. It is their unwillingness to sit back and leave the entire responsibility for ruling the world to human or superhuman authority   â€¦     This revolution had created powers of appalling destructiveness but they may yet be conquered. â€œThis book sketches some of the difficulties faced by our civilisation  â€”   a civilisation which might perhaps be described as aiming at humaneness

politifact14699,http://www.breakingnews365.net/59f509292adf6/alabama-football-crimson-tide-disqualified-from-national-championship.html,Alabama football Crimson Tide disqualified from national championship,"African American religious leaders have added their weight to calls for action on climate change, with one of the largest and oldest black churches in the US warning that black people are disproportionally harmed by global warming and fossil fuel pollution. The African Methodist Episcopal church has passed its first resolution in its   history devoted to climate change, calling for a swift transition to renewable energy. â€œWe can move away from the dirty fuels that make us sick and shift toward safe, clean energy like wind and solar that help make every breath our neighbors and families take a healthy one,â€ states the resolution, which also points to research showing that black children are four times as likely as white children to die from asthma.  The resolution was passed at the churchâ€™s general conference in Philadelphia, where more than 30, 000 members gathered. The AME church, the oldest independent Protestant denomination founded by black people in the world, has about 7, 000 congregations and 2. 5m members. â€œDamage to our climate puts the health of children, elderly, and those with chronic illnesses at greater risk and disproportionately impacts African Americans. We believe it is our duty to commit to taking action and promoting solutions that will help make our families and communities healthier and stronger,â€ stated Bishop John White, president of the council of bishops of the AME church. The resolution follows an open letter sent by African American clergy last year that called for political leaders to take â€œbold action to address climate changeâ€. The letter states: â€œThe voices of communities whose inhabitants look like us often are dismissed or disregarded. But the world cannot afford to silence us, and we cannot afford to be  â€”   and will not be  â€”   silent. Climate change most directly impacts the poor and marginalized, but ultimately, everyone is in jeopardy. â€ Jacquelyn   director of AME churchâ€™s social action commission, said that will â€œhold elected officials accountableâ€ over climate change. â€œIn communities of color, the church has been the voice on these kind of issues and we need to continue to be that voice,â€ she told the Guardian. â€œMany people may have heard that climate change is some sort of political trick  â€”   but when we speak, people will listen to us. We have an obligation to make this a focal point. â€   said that the churchâ€™s voter mobilization campaign will work throughout the 2016 election cycle to question candidates on climate change. Local officials and landlords will also be put under pressure over inadequate housing and infrastructure that helps spread pollution to black communities. According to the NAACP, African Americans emit far less carbon dioxide per person compared with white people and yet will bear the brunt of   deaths, due to the concentration of black people in cities. Faith leaders across the world have expressed alarm over climate change, with Pope Francis warning last year that â€œwe may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filthâ€. Some churches have backed the campaign to divest from fossil fuels.  June was the warmest on record in both the US and globally, marking the 14th consecutive month of   heat worldwide.",27,2,"925829696687886336	926160733867405315",fake

After a day spent running from school to work, from vetâ€™s appointments to childrenâ€™s hobbies, she reaches the end of her tether at a PTA meeting from hell in which she is asked to join â€œthe bakery policeâ€. â€œNo, thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m done,â€ she says, heading to a bar instead. â€œIf that makes me a bad mom then thatâ€™s fine. â€ Itâ€™s a scene many of us can relate to. Amy, with her desire to cut free in a fast car, down the odd drink and stop making her childrenâ€™s breakfast every morning, is not alone. In addition to Bad Moms, which pulled in $23m at the US box office last weekend, holding its own against spy juggernaut Jason Bourne, thereâ€™s Netflixâ€™s latest movie, Tallulah, in which Ellen Pageâ€™s free spirit steals a toddler from a hotel room when the childâ€™s mother passes out in a drunken coma after a bad date. On television, the hit US comedy Mom, now in its fourth season, follows Allison Janneyâ€™s character as she attempts to make amends after years of bad motherhood, while the cult hit Odd Mom Out turns a gimlet eye on the terrible and terrifying mothers of Manhattanâ€™s Upper East Side as they try to put the fun into fundraisers. Crime fiction, meanwhile, is saturated with imperfect mothers, from the heroine of Gilly Macmillanâ€™s debut Burnt Paper Sky, who loses her son on a walk in the park, to Alex Marwoodâ€™s The Darkest Secret, in which none of the mothers featured, good, bad, or apparently indifferent, is quite as she initially seems. The Mare, the hugely anticipated third novel from Mary Gaitskill, her first in more than a decade, also takes motherhood as its starting point. Drawing inspiration from Enid Bagnoldâ€™s National Velvet, Gaitskill tells the story of privileged white woman Ginger, Velvet  â€”   the Dominican teenager she supports for a time â€”   and Silvia, the girlâ€™s furious mother. It is both an emotional    tale and a raw meditation on motherhood. â€œBack in the 1990s I used to feel criticised by women for not having children, like there must be something wrong with me,â€ Gaitskill told New York Magazine on the bookâ€™s US publication. â€œPeople would say â€˜I donâ€™t see how a woman could be happy without childrenâ€™. It was almost like a dogma. [Now thatâ€™s changed] people got a good look and realised that it is really hard and itâ€™s not always lovable and rosy and everything working out. Maybe reality set in. â€ Is it this new understanding of the grimy reality lurking behind the   vision thatâ€™s driving us to embrace mums behaving badly? â€œI think partially what has happened is that the generation gap has narrowed,â€ says Jill Kargman, creator of Odd Mom Out. â€œWe donâ€™t age the way we used to, and pop culture reflects that  â€”   it tackles the fact that weâ€™re faking it being adults and often donâ€™t know what the hell weâ€™re doing. Itâ€™s also the case that, 20 years ago, women were absent from leadership positions within the industry now we have a voice. â€ Novelist Ayelet Waldman, who tackled this subject in 2009 with a series of essays titled Bad Mother, agrees that there has been a shift towards   projects within the entertainment industry, but sounds a note of caution. â€œThereâ€™s definitely been a resurgence of interest in movies by or about women, which started when Bridesmaids knocked it out of the financial park, but if you look at Bad Moms, youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s written and directed by men [Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who made their names with Las   lad fest The Hangover] and I think thatâ€™s telling. Female writers would probably present a less hackneyed, more complete version of what it means to be a mother. â€ Certainly itâ€™s true that Tallulah, which is written and directed by a woman, Sian Heder, who also writes for   prison drama Orange Is The New Black, presents a far more complicated picture of bad motherhood than the enjoyable but shallow Bad Moms, which for all the involvement of female producer Suzanne Todd is essentially a   The Hangover for women complete with   walking scenes and funky soundtrack. By contrast, Tallulahâ€™s bad mother, the neurotic, narcissistic Carolyn, is initially presented as a caricature of bad motherhood. Caked in makeup and squeezed into a hot pink dress, she barely registers her baby girl, doesnâ€™t appear to know how to change a nappy and has whatâ€™s best described as a cavalier approach to childcare, at one point dismissing her daughterâ€™s progress towards an open window with the words â€œshe has to learnâ€. Yet as the film progresses, our opinion of Carolyn changes and, if not entirely supporting her actions, we at least come to understand the   from which they spring. â€œAfter the premiere I became this weird priest hearing these   confessions and I realised all mums feel like failures,â€ Heder told the Los Angeles Times. â€œThereâ€™s a disconnect between the role of the mother as itâ€™s presented in the movies and what it actually feels like to be a mum, the amount of guilt and shame you put on yourself. â€ Itâ€™s this disconnect that films such as Bad Moms and shows such as Odd Mom Out tap into. The best scenes in Bad Moms are those in which our heroines,   Amy (Kunis) raunchy Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and mousey Kiki (Kristen Bell) cut loose, laughing hysterically as they leave the stresses of modern motherhood behind, while Odd Mom Out works so well because Kargman relishes lifeâ€™s absurdities. â€œIf you didnâ€™t see the humour in these sort of situations youâ€™d go crazy,â€ she says. â€œThereâ€™s so much insecurity surrounding motherhood. The way that people feel better about themselves is basically by putting others down. â€ Gill Hornby, whose 2013 novel The Hive treads similar ground to Bad Moms, agrees. â€œI think most people think theyâ€™re perfect mothers and itâ€™s everyone else whoâ€™s the problem,â€ she says. â€œA lot of time when people say â€˜oh, Iâ€™m a terrible motherâ€™ they actually donâ€™t mean it all in fact they want people to tell them thatâ€™s not true. Similarly you would never hear men saying â€˜oh, sheâ€™s a crap motherâ€™  â€”   itâ€™s always driven by other women, which sounds unsisterly but is true. â€ Yet Hornby admits she has some sympathy with those who buy into the motherhood myth. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of acting and spinning involved, and itâ€™s easy to act out of character  â€”   one of the things that always interested me is the idea of being thrust into an unelected friendship group, people you didnâ€™t choose to be friends with, and the effects that can have on your personality. Itâ€™s easy to get sucked in. â€ Itâ€™s also true that most of these mothers arenâ€™t exactly bad. Theyâ€™re not the wicked witches of fairytales, the cackling stepmothers looming with poisonous apples, the women forcing children out of their family homes into the dark woods nor are they the monsters of film past. There are no   wielding Mommie Dearests or violent abusers like Preciousâ€™s Mary. Itâ€™s notable that much of this â€œbad motheringâ€ would be fine if it was done by fathers. â€œDads have a      card,â€ says Kargman. â€œTraditionally their role was always to be the breadwinner so no one expected them to pitch in domestically. Iâ€™m sure back when cavemen went to hunt and the cave kids were with their mum there were still societal expectations placed on her. Itâ€™s almost like people know there are deadbeat dads, absentee dads, abusive dads, drunk dads, so if theyâ€™re anything remotely nice or normal they get a parade, whereas if we are human for one second we are branded. â€ Waldman agrees. â€œThe bar is set so low for fathers,â€ she says. â€œMy husband was once in the grocery store holding our baby who was filthy, covered in snot and chewing on a twist tie  â€”   basically something that has a sharp wire in it  â€”   and a lady stopped him and said, â€˜You are such a good dadâ€™. Imagine if Iâ€™d been standing there holding a filthy kid who was chewing on a bit of garbage: Iâ€™d have been arrested. The double standards are maddening. â€ Despite these concerns, Waldman says sheâ€™s in favour of the bad mummy trend. â€œUltimately I think itâ€™s a good thing  â€”   the more images we have of mothers that donâ€™t fit into that traditional selfless image the better,â€ she says. â€œSome of these films may be hitting the   fruit of tired female stories  â€”   like    mums versus mothers who work  â€”   but eventually weâ€™ll see more films written for women by women that are original, interesting and truly subversive. Theyâ€™ll be worth going to see. â€ Bad Moms is released in the UK on 26 August Tallulah is available on Netflix All Together Now by Gill Hornby is out in paperback, Abacus, Â£5. 99 The Mare is published by Serpentâ€™s Tail, Â£12. 99, Katharine Hepburn as Violet VenableSuddenly, Last Summer (1959) Hepburn is on magisterial, monstrous form in Joseph Mankiewiczâ€™s gloriously overheated take on Tennessee Williams.

The hospitality sector is also seeing cancellations, hotels are tightening security and foreign embassies are looking at reducing staffing after the attack on Friday claimed the lives of nine Italians, seven Japanese, an American, an Indian and some Bangladeshi nationals.  Fast Retailing, the Japanese owner of the Uniqlo   brand, said it would suspend all but critical travel to Bangladesh and has told staff to stay indoors.  Bangladeshâ€™s $26bn garment industry has been bracing itself for the fallout of Fridayâ€™s killings, fearing major retailers could rethink their sourcing plans after the latest attack targeting foreigners.  Bangladesh, one of the worldâ€™s poorest countries, relies on garments for about 80% of its exports and for about 4 million jobs,. It ranks behind only China as a supplier of clothes to developed markets such as Europe and the United States. Uniqlo has 10 Japanese staff in Bangladesh, one of its major production hubs outside China, and was among the first to confirm it would tighten travel restrictions already in place after attacks last year. Shovon Islam, the head of Sparrow Group, which supplies brands including Marks  Spencer and Gap, said: â€œObviously this is generating a lot of concern with all the brands my company works with. â€ He said that after a foreigner was killed in Bangladesh last year, some overseas companies pared back travel to the country and asked for meetings to be held in Bangkok, New Delhi or Hong Kong instead.  Islam said: â€œThis time the intensity of the threat is much higher and we will definitely see companies altering their plans. â€  Sudhir Dhingra, the head of Orient Craft based in the Indian city of Gurgaon, said: â€œThereâ€™ll definitely be an impact on the garment industry. I was just speaking to a top label which said its official who was supposed to visit Bangladesh to inspect an order has refused to go. â€  Bangladesh garment exporters who dealt with some of those killed in the attack were still coming to terms with what has happened. â€œI was doing business with six of the nine Italians who died. Itâ€™s shocking and heartbreaking,â€ said Meshba Uddin Ali, the managing director of Wega Fashion Sweater.  Amos Ho, a senior manager at Pou Chen, one of the worldâ€™s largest makers of trainers for brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma, said: â€œWeâ€™ve urged our employees to be cautious. They have to pay attention to their personal safety. â€  Industry analysts have suggested clothing brands may now consider shifting out of Bangladesh to less unsettled countries in Asia, such as Cambodia and Sri Lanka. No major companies have yet signalled official plans.  â€œThere are no plans on changing any sourcing, but we are following developments closely,â€ Swedenâ€™s HM said in a statement echoed by other big retailers.  TheUS and British embassies in Bangladesh may reduce staff numbers, one diplomatic source said, and ask only essential staff to stay on.  The Japanese construction companies Obayashi and Shimizu, which both have more than a dozen employees working on bridge projects in Bangladesh, said they had advised staff to stay indoors.  At least two   hotels in Dhaka that cater primarily to business clients said they had received cancellations since Fridayâ€™s attack. â€œWhenever people book itâ€™s usually within two or three days of their visit to Dhaka and now nobody is doing any bookings at all,â€ said a source at one of the hotels, adding that this week was typically quiet due to the upcoming Eid celebrations.

politifact14666,http://conservative7.com/2017/10/10/breaking-black-hockey-player-fired-raising-fist-national-anthem/,BREAKING: Black Hockey Player FIRED After Raising Fist During National Anthem,"New Yorkâ€™s Guggenheim museum unveiled its latest installation on Friday  â€”   a solid gold toilet titled America. The toilet, which the Guardian can confirm is fully functioning, is the work of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, who describes the piece as â€œ100% art for the 99%â€. Visitors to the museum are able to use the golden toilet in much the same way as they would use a normal toilet. It is located in a standard,   bathroom on the fourth floor of the museum, a small placard the only indication of its presence. The Guardian was invited to use the facilities on Friday morning. Entering the bathroom, the eye was immediately drawn to the toilet. The bright bowl glimmered under the bathroomâ€™s harsh fluorescent light, while the   gold seat looked sparkly and inviting. The surface proved forgiving on the rear of the thigh and once the procedure was complete, the flush worked like a charm. The golden toilet was able to handle solids. The toilet was created to the exact dimensions of the Guggenheimâ€™s existing toilets. The museum shipped two toilets to Italy, where Cattelan cast the golden toilet in several parts before welding it together. Michael Zall, associate director of operations at the Guggenheim, oversaw the installation of the toilet. He engaged the services of a â€œvery professionalâ€ plumber, who he said was excited by the prospect of fitting a solid gold toilet. â€œWhen he was here he kind of turned into a little kid, and he said he actually had butterflies,â€ Zall said. The toilet was fitted on Monday. â€œWe wanted to try to get it here and get it in as quick as possible so that we had some time to troubleshoot and make sure everything is just right,â€ Zall said. He said the troubleshooting had involved â€œa lot of flushingâ€.  â€œPutting some paper in it, making sure it flushed well, that everything left the toilet. â€ In a press release the Guggenheim linked the golden toilet to Donald Trumpâ€™s business and political career. â€œThe aesthetics of this â€˜throneâ€™ recall nothing so much as the gilded excess of Trumpâ€™s   ventures and private residences,â€ it said. While Trump is known to have golden chairs in his New York City penthouse, it is not known whether he has a golden toilet. Cattelan told the Guggenheim that he had the idea for the toilet before Trumpâ€™s political rise, but said â€œit was probably in the airâ€. He said the golden toilet is in part a nod to Marcel Duchampâ€™s 1917 artwork Fountain, which was a urinal. Nathan Otterson, senior conservator, objects at the Guggenheim, is responsible for maintaining the toilet. He said a cleaning crew will attend to the toilet every 15 minutes. â€œTheyâ€™ll wipe down the toilet with a medical wipe that will sanitize it and then at a longer interval it will be   like in a hospital,â€ he said. A security officer will stand guard outside the toilet. People will only be allowed to enter one at a time, and bags must be left outside. â€œWe would hope no one would try to remove part of the toilet,â€ Otterson said. There has been some internal discussion over imposing a time limit on golden toilet visits, he said, with people potentially being limited to five minutes per visit. There was a small line of people outside the Guggenheim on Friday morning. A woman called Rachel, who asked that her last name not be used, said she was there specifically to use the golden toilet. She declined to elaborate on her plans, but said she was â€œexcitedâ€ at the prospect of using the toilet. â€œA friend posted it on Facebook last night,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s hilarious and who wouldnâ€™t want to pee on art?â€ Rachel said her most enjoyable toilet experience to date was in Japan. â€œThey have the best toilets. They have water in them, theyâ€™re heated, sometimes they play music. Theyâ€™re amazing. â€",27,335,"917445696235569152	917446491064684544	917467973710958592	917496704160722944	917518821073801216	917521264780210177	917524399510528000	917599195032440832	917606605780381698	917610401038258176	917620170914484224	917626993092505600	917627202795171841	917631683888930817	917651863641747456	917665501236543489	917668649246347264	917672325738311680	917686918854397953	917695816353030145	917699570540404736	917699704368099328	917699852405964800	917703024386207746	917704457374392320	917720773070086145	917725618304966656	917728002980634625	917728286528204800	917744074458828801	917762600154353664	917766115413159936	917778386960908288	917780119372124160	917780505453563909	917796627749904384	917808924912345088	917823669765885953	917838451331940353	917839072063664128	917876300391600129	917877515888283648	917894953342324737	917930148741238784	917936397658370048	917940727019130880	917945930392973312	917947194006822912	917947509674307584	917954989087129600	918084849520533504	918088815809622016	918113626929602560	918128628260581377	918142953050304513	918168637244047360	918209954082725888	918232645359755264	918243177840001030	918264805995307008	918285702382661632	918326083010773000	918380396655525888	918406075107463168	918433921720815618	918850078386745354	918912730119024640	919196236946612224	919280034040500226	919603077723906048	919610085193781257	919654380969660416	919715320465633282	919768026051837952	920115148706189312	920369384492642304	920400564399329281	920419113268404224	920460730423566336	920483578747785216	920659369704017923	920737483804962816	920751768824188928	920754456102342659	920756573500084224	920777027766145024	920778360040673281	920790135654027265	920794889968689153	920795816100368384	920814335210946560	920821201991331842	920831654473723905	920845109599621121	920863635332878336	920875514079965184	920882112378605569	920898487692288000	920904976708395008	920916841761001472	920929391022170112	920945717765705728	920958491988234240	920960916673490946	920970441543561216	920977240384471040	920982228674514944	920983866898288642	920991808766783488	920994586503340032	921001947179769857	921002893460819968	921003373641502720	921007084325474304	921011297554194433	921013500448780288	921016389971861504	921017735739473920	921018049016287233	921022014252617728	921036410978672641	921036445934129152	921046722423476224	921049266914672640	921050034577297408	921054558805250049	921056143081951234	921056971419131904	921058043160399872	921062297329582081	921069289561640960	921071402786140160	921074780689895424	921076775526043649	921077423420198912	921079702097465345	921087780603777024	921092250255405056	921093229843533827	921093406729953281	921094671744557058	921100921848893445	921102037357682694	921104451125080064	921106608947712000	921106645689573376	921109973614190603	921119301226123264	921119451843579905	921119471024123906	921121018109759488	921127939424636928	921128904915550209	921131011265695745	921131319370964993	921132949331836928	921135844685213697	921140253628485632	921153583172665344	921154412361539586	921154956438142977	921155574133329921	921158559299244032	921159094714630144	921163666644488192	921164751815798787	921165014102429696	921166736409464833	921168368102670336	921168462168420352	921171866588348416	921174076055609344	921174967517106176	921175451325947904	921178013936635904	921181682878898176	921185481840300033	921186267815206912	921195883982663680	921198054023286784	921199277061394432	921200127141928960	921212814563430400	921216172095307776	921216468712329216	921219255743348738	921236114920292352	921243335112749056	921250082091159552	921251077881769984	921280681182769152	921296968860782592	921308806906249222	921309560744435714	921323956291989504	921341243698876416	921346533559283713	921385206568902656	921386964577857537	921393632250355713	921394373350379520	921395081709522944	921396456992292864	921401607098482688	921401661951741952	921405165349101568	921409584551604225	921412038676635649	921416608240816128	921420461824724992	921420662832590848	921422054938808322	921424591125467136	921424961214013440	921426380017029120	921456366019002368	921457354985545728	921466612984803329	921470142222966784	921471193160605697	921478096972283905	921486392986828800	921488431586447360	921495775057711105	921496281352060930	921496781916999680	921497612490084352	921499514971803649	921499715941928960	921500477602390017	921500607470546945	921501630931066881	921505632963964930	921507198538342400	921508835818377217	921513995533799424	921533776244740097	921534451724759040	921538011145424896	921538331984482305	921540854514442241	921557621739589632	921563436030578688	921577197634191360	921583145740374016	921583746586988544	921601621796286465	921613641799143424	921749038940205058	921767770236350465	921778616274472962	921834348667703296	921880458530578432	921886594029760512	921903964341374976	922059088170713088	922995636932296704	923550749254144000	923689173210554370",fake
politifact15416,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-statement-recusal,Attorney General Sessions Statement on Recusal,"Weâ€™re going to wrap up our live blog politics coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us these past two weeks for the action in Cleveland and Philadelphia  â€”   and we hope youâ€™ll come with us for the 101 days ahead.  This seems to be a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasnâ€™t classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk. â€  â€”   Jason Miller, Trump senior communications adviser, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill nudges back at the report of a hack of Clinton campaign data with a statement that raises lots of question marks:  An analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack. Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised.  The computer network used by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign has been hacked, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.  The new intrusion is part of a broad   on Democratic political organizations, the sources said, though it was not immediately clear that Russian hackers were behind the third attack.  In a statement, the FBI said it was looking into the matter. The bureau said it â€œtakes seriously any allegations of intrusionsâ€ and is â€œaware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these mattersâ€. Russian hackers designated Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear by cybersecurity analysts broke into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) beginning last year and are believed to be the source of   organization WikiLeaksâ€™s release of 20, 000 emails, though the group has denied this. Last Sunday, that leak led to the resignation of the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, shortly before the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia. The breach of the DNC is believed by security researchers in private industry and the US government to have been the work Russian intelligence services. This week the fundraising network of the the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) was breached, an act Reuters said US intelligence officials had attributed to Russians as well. The US Department of Justiceâ€™s national security division is investigating whether hacking attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened US security, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. With 20 extremely good reasons (read: electoral votes) to discover a local connection in Pennsylvania, Virginia senator Tim Kaine saw reflections of his childhood walking through the Kâ€™NEX toy manufacturer in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, writes Lauren Gambino at the scene: The Vice Presidential nominee told the crowd of about 300 people, made up of Kâ€™NEX employees and teachers, that he recognized some of the machinery from his childhood, working alongside his family in his fatherâ€™s iron crafting business in Kansas. â€œThis brings back memories, coming here and seeing some machinery thatâ€™s really familiar to me and some machinery thatâ€™s not so familiar,â€ Kaine said, standing in front of the campaign logo made of Kâ€™NEX.  â€œ[It was] his five or six employees, my two brothers, me and my mom basically making that business work, thatâ€™s what small business do,â€ Kaine said.  These anecdotes, delivered with Kaineâ€™s affable smile, add up to strong justification for the Virginia senatorâ€™s place on the ticket.  â€œYou will hear people say when it comes to manufacturing that American manufacturing is dead,â€ said Kaine, â€œbut that is not the case and itâ€™s often these family businesses just like Rodon Kâ€™NEX that are keeping it alive. â€ Kaine introduced Clinton, who was joined by her husband and Kaineâ€™s wife, Anne Holton. The four traveled by bus from Philadelphia, where they kicked off a   tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio.  Who wishes it were Friday? Good news for you: tis.  Trump finishes off with an insult for the fire marshall who has not allowed extra people into the hall   â€œheâ€™s probably a Democrat. .. he doesnâ€™t get itâ€   before heading to the room next door where apparently 1000 spillover people are waiting. Trump seems to be doing a recap on the most offensive things heâ€™s said to journalists during the campaign. Heâ€™s mentionied New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who suffers from a physical disability, which Trump appeared to imitate when talking about him several months ago.  â€œI didnâ€™t know he was disabled. I didnâ€™t know it. I didnâ€™t know it all. I had no idea,â€ said Trump in Colorado Springs. Trump also just referenced his comments said about Fox Newsâ€™ Megyn Kelly, where he had said after a debate   after she asked him tough questions   that she had â€œblood coming out of her wherever. â€  â€œI was talking about her nose. Maybe her ears,â€ just said Trump in Colorado Springs. It was widely assumed that Trump was referring to Kelly getting her period when he made his reference to â€œwhatever. â€  â€œI wanted to get back onto the questions of taxes and economies, I said â€˜whateverâ€™ . .. these are sick people. But really, it was nose,â€ he said. Donald Trump said he is â€œstarting to agreeâ€ with his supporters who chanted â€œlock her upâ€ regarding Hillary Clinton during his events. â€œHow do you lie to the FBI and now youâ€™re running for presidentâ€ asked Trump in Colorado Springs, speaking about Clinton. He repeated the line several times to emphasize it. The crowd began chanting â€œlock her up, lock her up. â€ â€œYou know what, Iâ€™ve been saying lets just beat her on November 8, but you know what, Iâ€™m starting to agree with you,â€ said Trump. â€œEvery time I mention her, people start screaming lock her up. But after watching that performance, with so many lies. .. Iâ€™m taking the gloves off,â€ he said. â€œJust remember this, Trump is going to be no more Mister Nice Guy. Tell Hillary Iâ€™m not going to be nice anymore, are you ready?â€ he said. This weekend the Koch Brothers are hosting a retreat for top conservative donors in Colorado Springs. And Trump just happens to be in Colorado Springs today. But, Charles Koch rebuffed Trumpâ€™s attempts to meet with him, according to Politico.  The Koch brothers, who are usually huge GOP supporters, have spoken out against Trump as nominee and have said they donâ€™t plan to help fund him. â€œI think I have the best temperament, or certainly one of the best, of anyone thatâ€™s ever run for the office of president,â€ declares Trump. â€œMy temperament is winner. I know how to win. My whole life Iâ€™ve been winning,â€ he said. Trump criticized CNN, complaining how they had reported on his tweets lately. He then claimed that he could see the red light on the camera manâ€™s camera turn off. Trump talks about the Nielsen ratings for television that have just come out, which shows 32 million people tuned into watch Trumpâ€™s speech, while 28 million saw Clintonâ€™s last night. He says the RNC last week in Cleveland was much better than the DNC, and, being a TV guy, notes he thought the RNC background set was better.  â€œWe beat her by millions on televisions,â€ said Trump. â€œHonestly, the numbers were incredible. Which tells you, isnâ€™t it good to have Trump running for the presidency?â€ Trump starts off getting the crowd to boo the fire marshall, as apparently hundreds of people waiting outside are not being allowed into the venue because the fire marshall wonâ€™t let them. â€œIt really is so unfair,â€ said Trump. â€œThe reasons they wont let them in is because they donâ€™t know what the hell theyâ€™re doing. Too bad. â€œMaybe theyâ€™re a Hillary person? Probably,â€ he said. Announcement at the Trump event in Colorado Springs   where Trump was supposed to take to the stage 45 minutes ago   that the Republican nominee is now in the building and is expected to address the crowd in five minutes. Interesting contrast between Donald Trump and his running mate when it comes to dealing with the media. During rallies, Trump regularly gets supporters to turn to the media and boo and has banned a list of publications from covering his events. His VP pick Mike Pence said earlier today that he was trying to stop reporters being denied entry. â€œI have a long history. ..of advocating and defending for a free and independent press,â€ he said. And now Pence is taking it one step further, supplying reporters on the campaign trail with birthday cake!",199,14,"837410642751533056	837410841280512000	837411345557499904	837411359990165504	837411831673196545	837411915726995456	837412198498635776	837412394955640832	837412490153705473	837413613438631936	837413744783290371	837413742484783106	837413854317428736	837414431067893762	837414435782197249	837414513427230720	837414526891012096	837414869829742592	837415014210269184	837415574963552256	837416209943519232	837417234540658688	837417325192171521	837417570709839872	837417703056998404	837418225788981248	837418545445154817	837420444504334337	837421597275344898	837421730398363648	837422068845137921	837422106266628097	837422950185840640	837423004434972675	837425971548545024	837426345613262848	837428195783651328	837428553834774533	837428753206820868	837433555340955651	837435859573997568	837437349239795712	837437641024929792	837439212408324097	837439441065099264	837439841805746176	837439876828114945	837439957060956160	837439969039790080	837440005140275200	837440066918182912	837443234565500928	837443763148554241	837445952201981952	837448096468496385	837448492620603392	837448944363974660	837449534875680769	837451298450591744	837454086777659393	837462782761136128	837466796403929088	837467654931755009	837468951466606594	837469470008340480	837487723078352896	837489357518958592	837491043457101825	837491196931031041	837503596912500739	837507495820054528	837530391716093953	837570864380067841	837595615982931970	837621268505628672	837771768941137925	837782580808323073	838026506819489793	838095245178908672	838379221609238528	842109655857942528	862268317763031040	863108022427541504	871846018123517953	873523146845896706	882031939510824960	882364678231425024	888124647564234752	888165400323788800	888481179032199168	889864800930549760	890269641116983296	930258050912571392	944030627728449537	955572255819554816	975753239558680581	988826487401975808	988826665563312128	988921605635133440	989118819187781632	993105610487906305	1001834558994747394	1001878818389463040	1002121341175304192	1036237706232295425	1049876227417362433	1050193891763343360	1060148334432804864	1060304686245392384	1060835215059279872",fake

The simple answer is that they are fans of â€œcuppingâ€  â€”   an alternative health technique that involves pressing hot jars on to the body. This creates suction, which is claimed to increase blood flow to those areas. The swimmers and gymnasts who use it say it helps relieve soreness in their battered bodies. It would certainly help relieve overburdened wallets, but there is no evidence it does anything else. Eating jam out of those jars would probably have a more significant physical impact, though it might not be the most nutritionally savvy strategy. But then again, this is the Olympics. Aside from proving that Olympians are just as credulous as celebrity cupping fans like Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow when it comes to   thereâ€™s something more interesting at work here. Years and years of relentless, gruelling, exhausting training have brought these bodies to this moment. Now they are at the very culmination of that process. There is no more training they can fit in, nothing left to do but get out there and perform, while the eyes of the world watch them. Suddenly, itâ€™s not the body that matters but the mind. The pressure is immense  â€”   and unimaginable to most of us. In that pressure cooker, if you get your head in the right place by some hokey but essentially harmless alternative therapy that your teammate swears works for them, it must be really hard to see the down side. Why wouldnâ€™t you give it a try? Even though itâ€™s totally unproven as an effective therapy, cupping involves lying down, being forced to relax, while someone does something painless to you that they authoritatively claim will make you feel better. They might as well just rename it the Placebo Treatment  â€”   but thatâ€™s exactly what the circumstances call for. A tiny moment of releasing the pressure of all that expectation and tension. The byword in sport these days is â€œmarginal gainsâ€  â€”   tiny, incremental adjustments in kit, technique and training that, when added together, make for big improvements. Think of cupping as the   version. After all, most athletes have their own rituals and superstitions  â€”   and if a lifetime of dreaming of gold came down to a few minutes of your life, you would take every edge you can get too, and

The latest ABC print sale audit shows national papers down only 2. 8% year on year and a mere 0. 79% on Brexit June. All three quality Sundays  â€”   the Observer, Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Times  â€”   sold more copies last month than in July 2015. And a look at ABCâ€™s   report (print and online) on 174 of Britainâ€™s biggest magazines seems to tell a familiar story. Thereâ€™s an average drop of 5. 2% year on year to be sure  â€”   more grist for the  â€™ mill  â€”   yet look a little deeper. Youâ€™ll find a lot of winners among the losers: try House Beautiful, Harperâ€™s Bazaar and Esquire. But thereâ€™s also a cluster of solid performers gaining a little and losing nothing. Hereâ€™s the Economist in the UK, up 3. 7% the incredibly resilient Private Eye, up 0. 8% The Week, up 0. 7% Prospect, up 3. 3% the Oldie, up 0. 6% the Times Literary Supplement, up 7. 8%. And  â€”   bouncing on dramatic internet expansion  â€”   thereâ€™s the Spectator, up 37. 9%. In short, opinion, reportage, analysis and wit still find a market. Words, not pictures. Ideas, not celebrity mush. Life, not lists. Just thought Iâ€™d mention it. Last month, Gawker Media was American publishingâ€™s   website, with 434m page views overall. This week, the Gawker gossip site (Private Eye with a tabloid twist) that began it all will be dead and buried  â€”   closed by the cumulative weight of   lawsuits funded by a vigilante Silicon Valley billionaire with his own agenda. Good riddance to bad rubbish? You can piously say so if you wish. But goodbye, too, to a great deal of sharp, necessary and often brave reporting. Life on the edge not merely punished, but extinguished. What do you do if youâ€™re Donald Trump and youâ€™re losing? You persuade Stephen Bannon, top dog at Breitbart News, the rightwing web news site that loves Nigel Farage, to run your campaign (â€œI have been fought at every step of the way by total amateurs who come to London once a month with sandwiches in their rucksacks, to attend Ukip NEC meetings that normally last seven hours,â€ writes a plangent Farage). You get Roger Ailes, the hangdog   of Fox News to rehearse you for TV debates. And what if that doesnâ€™t work either? Maybe hire Nigel direct.

These are the crucial updates your feed needs for 2017.  ðŸŽ…ðŸ¼ðŸŽ„â›„ï¸ï¸ by @anddicted, A photo posted by Flatlays (@flatlays) on Dec 11, 2016 at 4:34am PST, You donâ€™t know what a flat lay is? Seriously? OK, consider this. Those birdâ€™s eye photos that get a lot of likes  â€”   a coffee cup with a foam heart, iPhone at a   angle, Ray Bans perched on top of a passport, scattered clementine segments adding a pop of colour  â€”   is that really how your kitchen table looks five minutes before you leave for the airport? No, it jolly well isnâ€™t, any more than a pile of Pink Lady apples in your fruit bowl looks like a bloody Cezanne. The flat lay is the modern still life, and mastering it is essential for anyone with lifestyle aspirations. Never, ever mention in the caption that it took you 15 minutes to get rid of the annoying shadow and that you now have backache from craning over the coffee table.  Details. #commedesgarcons #levis501 #lumojewelry, A photo posted by Mija by Mirjam Flatau (@mija_mija) on Jun 17, 2016 at 9:29am PDT, Mirror selfies are for sexting, these days, not for OOTD. So if you are in the fashion gang and the goal is to capture your Look rather than what lies beneath, the armâ€™s length selfie is way cooler. Find somewhere photogenic to perch, then sit with one foot drawn towards your crotch (this is not comfortable but â€œreadsâ€ as relaxed, which is what matters) and hold the phone as far from you as you can, angled downward so that your body is in the photo but not your head. Advantages: the      is always flattering, plus you donâ€™t need to worry about the facial expression you pull when you are trying to keep your little finger out of the shot without giving yourself cramp.

But have you noticed how suspiciously flattering they are? How they make everyone look a little bit like a Disney bluebird? Hmmm. They are basically hot dog legs with added lols. These are a vanity project that has been well and truly rumbled. Cease and desist. What did the Kardashians and Gigi Hadid all do on Instagram toward the end of 2016? Get off Instagram, thatâ€™s what. In the era of oversharing, the most compelling thing you can do is to withdraw. Just as the very best parties have a social media blackout, so the most intriguing people donâ€™t feel compelled to post their avocado every single freaking Sunday. Take a strategic break.

Tru","The mother of an autistic man who allegedly wanted to shoot Donald Trump at a campaign rally before the US election has appealed to Barack Obama to allow her son to serve his sentence in Britain. Michael Sandford, 20, will be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty to lesser charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business.  The Briton attempted to grab a pistol from a police officer at a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas four months before the election, and said he had wanted to kill the then presidential candidate. Sandford had hoped to receive the minimum sentence of   months in prison, because he has no previous convictions, and to be allowed to serve it in England. But his mother has said he is terrified that pressure from the   may result in a more severe sentence that has to be served in the US. Lynne Sandford said: â€œWhen he first heard that Mr Trump had won, he told me: â€˜Iâ€™m so glad I didnâ€™t do what I wanted to do that day, and I do accept and respect the decision of the American people.â€™ But within 24 hours, it hit him like a sledgehammer. â€œHe was in a terrible state, saying: â€˜What if the judge decides to increase my sentence to get onside with Trump? What if Trump wants to have me bumped off in prison, what if he wants to make example of me and not let me out of prison? â€™â€ Lynne Sandford has seen her son once since he was taken into custody, but will fly to the US for his sentencing on 13 December. She said Michael had recently written her a letter saying he was struggling to get by.  â€œHe said: â€˜I canâ€™t describe how Iâ€™m feeling. Tears are streaming down my face as I write this. I miss you all and love you all more than words can explain. I need to be back home with you all. Iâ€™m so alone, cold and scared here. You all mean everything to me and Iâ€™m so sorry for how I have treated you all. I love you, I love you, I love you,â€™â€ she said. Her son has a range of acute and complex medical issues. He has had severe obsessive compulsive disorder, was sectioned aged 14, previously tried to kill himself, and has a heart condition. He was diagnosed as having been under the influence of a delusional, psychotic episode at the time of the incident.  He was initially told he faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison after being charged in June with disrupting an official function and two firearms offences. He is being held in custody at a US   detention centre in Nevada. â€œThe US and UK have to agree to him serving his sentence in England. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a problem for the English side, but once Mr Trump is president, he might not agree to it,â€ Lynne Sandford said. â€œThatâ€™s what weâ€™re worried about.  â€œI have written to President Obama and Theresa May to see if they can intervene. Iâ€™m hoping that President Obama will show compassion and realise that this poor sap could be on the receiving end of Trumpâ€™s anger, and I am urging him to act in any way he can while he is still in power. â€  She said she had received a standard reply from Downing Street and was yet to hear from the White House. Her son has been on suicide watch for much of his time in detention. â€œWhen heâ€™s on suicide watch, heâ€™s in isolation his cell 24 hours a day. He is not allowed anything in with him not even toilet paper, in case he rams it down his throat,â€ she said.  She has been told her son is being given 15 tablets a day, but not what for or what dosage. â€œAll I know is he is being given them erratically, sometimes in one go. Heâ€™s had more seizures and has been hallucinating. I would imagine this is the result of the erratic medication,â€ she said. Her son had lost a great deal of weight and was less than eight stone, she said. Michael, who is 5ft 10, has had anorexia nervosa in the past. â€œHe is eating porridge in the morning and a bread roll in the evening, and thatâ€™s it. He is unable to sleep at night because the lights in his cell are kept on all night. He is severely depressed,â€ the mother said. She said she wanted to thank Guardian readers who had donated more than Â£10, 000 to a Crowdjustice page set up to raise money for his legal fees after the Guardianâ€™s Weekend magazine wrote about his case. â€œIt was an amazing response,â€ she said. â€œWe were so touched and appreciative, and Michael passes on his sincerest thanks to everybody trying to help him. Iâ€™m glad readers realise that despite what he attempted to do, heâ€™s not a bad person at heart, and that he needs help. â€ She has started a new Crowdjustice page to raise funds to try to bring him back to the UK to serve his sentence close to his family.",321,979,"934060170908504064	934207140243353602	934214105044578304	934241576183742464	934271442212065281	934454979200462848	934491090304077829	934821698934845440	935329292866613248	935344049359413248	935379411708317696	935456408576974848	935458349998596098	935479742215655424	935579392431890433	935590352819548160	935653877361324032	935675446674558977	935723387552399360	935726529694355456	935732715290230786	935760278343561216	935798928469123073	935909374610034689	935947371539779584	935987946326503424	936197159938031621	936325100172754944	936327309338005504	936400685071044608	936415703158095872	936417904911880192	936732924782792704	1012280494128615424	1036100135657201665",fake

It canâ€™t help but remind us of the absence of the man who turned a profile of Federer into the greatest essay about tennis. That David Foster Wallace died by his own hand so soon after the conclusion of the 2008 US Open, the last year when Federer would win that tournament, only makes the resonance echo louder. In an effort, perhaps, to salve that wound for Wallace fans, earlier this year the Library of America released a new anthology of Wallaceâ€™s tennis writing. Even though the game has moved on from the period that Wallace covered (the most recent essay is from a decade ago) the collection is still rich with insights into how math and metaphysics make tennis the most beautiful of sports. Wallace was interested in how transcendence was possible if the whole world was mediated through the self. In both his fiction and essays, Wallace used tennis to wrestle with this unanswerable question. Here, in a passage from his   Infinite Jest, a tennis coach muses to himself:  The true opponent, the enfolding boundary, is the player himself. Always and only the self out there, on court, to be met, fought, brought to the table to hammer out terms. The competing boy on the netâ€™s other side: he is not the foe: he is more the partner in the dance.  This philosophy echoes some ideas that also surface in the tennis writing of the New Yorker writer John McPhee. Levels of the Game, McPheeâ€™s   dissection of a   match between Chuck Graebner and Arhur Ashe at the 1968 US Open, manages to be about the self, racism, the American south, Republicans, Democrats, the 1960s, the professionalization of tennis, human excellence, art and politics. This forms a fascinating contrast with Wallaceâ€™s own tennis style, as described in his writing. In his own childhood, Wallace wrote, he wasnâ€™t thinking about transcendence at all. He was â€œplaying the conditionsâ€ using environmental factors  â€”   particularly the midwestâ€™s frustratingly strong and chaotic winds  â€”   to his advantage. The wind could make a good ball go long and â€œdrove some kids   with the caprice and unfairness of it all, and on real windy days these kids, usually with talent out the bazoo, would have their first apoplectic   tantrum in about the matchâ€™s third gameâ€. Meanwhile, Wallace, who â€œwas such a lazy turd in practiceâ€ would calmly hit the ball down the middle of the court, daring the other players to take the aforementioned   risks.  Wallaceâ€™s method of playing tennis isnâ€™t unique the approach even has its own book, though not a literary one. Itâ€™s called Winning Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis, written by the superstar coach and ESPN commentator Brad Gilbert. Gilbertâ€™s philosophy is simple: tennis is about winning games and sets. Forget about transcending the self  â€”   play the opponent physically and psychologically, play the conditions, use every advantage you can muster, and donâ€™t worry about perfection. Itâ€™s not clear if Wallace ever read Gilbertâ€™s book (he never mentions it) but itâ€™s likely he did. The book was extremely popular in the 1990s. And in todayâ€™s tennis, winning ugly is probably best represented by the current world No 1, Novak Djokovic. He plays the game with a style something like the   from the Terminator movies, morphing around whatever you throw at him to become even deadlier until you go mad trying to beat him. It was Federerâ€™s much more elegant style, which could be called â€œwinning beautifulâ€ that drew Wallace to him. Wallace spent almost no time interviewing Federer for his virtuosic essay Roger Federer as Religious Experience, originally published in the New York Times Magazine. Wallaceâ€™s argument was that Federerâ€™s greatness lay in the way he turned compositional beauty into a kind of weapon, in the way he transcended the limits of the human body and the speed at which we think. This made Federer a somewhat uninteresting person, nearly   but capable of unimaginable physical grace. Itâ€™s hard not to see some element of   in all Wallaceâ€™s praise of Federer. His writing always betrayed some of his desire to win ugly. Itâ€™s hard to think of a writer whose voice more relied on the presence of the authorial self on the page. Wallace reveled in subverting magazine assignments, and liked to use every trick in the book to move, impress and thrill a reader. In a way, his writing is often like an extended match between Federer and Djokovic, with Wallace playing both parts, luring you into traps one second, moving you to tears with beauty and grace the next. The transcendent impulse in Wallaceâ€™s writing is the key to his recent canonization. At its best, this impulse lent Wallaceâ€™s writing an otherworldly quality, as if he had been sent here to explain us to ourselves. Without it, thereâ€™s no This Is Water, the commencement speech posthumously turned into a     book no long list of things learned in rehab that became one of Infinite Jestâ€™s most widely quoted passages and no     transcendent description of the key to Federerâ€™s appeal  â€”   â€œhav[ing] to do with   â€¦     human beingsâ€™ reconciliation to having a bodyâ€. Sometimes one wonders what Wallace would have made of his both understandable and frustrating elevation to Saint Dave. But in his tennis writing itâ€™s not hard, sometimes, to see why heâ€™s treated like a modern prophet. No one can write about tennis like this now, just like no one can imagine the â€œBaby Federersâ€ like Milos Raonic or Grigor Dmitrov redefining the sport with weaponized beauty the way Roger has. But perhaps thatâ€™s because weâ€™re waiting for someone to write like Wallace or play like Federer, instead of looking for players and writers who create whole new ways to win, ugly and beautiful all at once.

And then it hits the shore and bounces back, and then it comes back again, but itâ€™s much smaller and muted. But those little waves are still going back and forth. â€ Phillips, a former district governor for Rotary International and an engineer by trade, moved to Schenectady more than 30 years ago to work at General Electric (GE) once the largest single employer in the region. But in 1974, General Electric moved its headquarters from New York City to a more expansive facility in Fairfield, Connecticut and, between that and the tectonic shifts in Americaâ€™s economy, the successive waves of downsizing changed the city and the surrounding area in ways nobody could have predicted. The loss of jobs at GE  â€”   which, at its height, employed about 30, 000 workers in a vertically integrated manufacturing facility with back office functions for the rest of the corporation  â€”   transformed Schenectady (like the loss of so many other manufacturers would transform so many other manufacturing communities) into a very different and not altogether better place for the people who had located their lives here. Only about 5, 600 people worked in manufacturing in the county in 2011  â€”   total. General Electric has only about 4, 000 employees there now. The largest employment sectors are healthcare and retail work as part of an economic development plan, the state licensed a casino at the site of one of the manufacturing facilities once used by GE and the 1, 500 jobs it will bring to the area is considered a huge boon. What happened to Schenectady as a result of GE scaling back its operations in the area isnâ€™t a unique story: you could write a similar piece about any American rust belt town. But maybe to understand the very real economic anxiety that people feel here it helps to understand the sense of security with which many people grew up. Sitting in the living room of his house in Scotia  â€”   a suburb just across the river that was developed as the middle class, created by   jobs at GE, increased the demand for housing in the area  â€”   Bernie Witkowski reminisced about the role the company played in his family. â€œWhen [my dad] got a job with General Electric, that was it. I mean, that was the dream, OK?â€ he said.  â€œThe GE was the thing. Almost all my uncles worked for General Electric in Schenectady, everybody worked for GE. And when I was brought up, thatâ€™s what we heard all the time. â€˜Oh, when you get out of high school, you go to GE, you go to GE. â€™â€ he explained. â€œMy cousins went to GE. I went. â€ He started as a stock boy in March of 1967 after high school and moved into the electrician apprentice program before he was drafted in 1968 and went to Vietnam. When he got out, he went back and spent the rest of his working years at the company. â€œThere was no reason to leave because it was a good job,â€ he said. â€œIt was a great job. â€ Don Chapadeau was a lifer at General Electric, too: he started there in 1973 and retired after 42 years. â€œMy father was employed by GE  â€”   he worked in Utica [about 75 miles west of Schenectady]  â€”   and my grandfather was GE,â€ he explained. â€œBack in the 70s, that was the place to be. â€ Like Witkowski, Chapadeau joined the company straight out of high school in 1973. â€œI didnâ€™t want to go to college, I worked with my hands, so it was the place to be,â€ he said. â€œI did everything from clean toilets to build turbines and generators. â€ At the beginning of their downsizing in Schenectady, General Electric wasnâ€™t moving facilities to Mexico or China, though that happened later. They moved manufacturing facilities south, where wages were lower and unions less powerful. â€œThey used to have a motor department there,â€ Witkowski explained. â€œThey moved somewhere south,   shops, lower wages, that was the first big move. â€ But in a vertically integrated manufacturing facility like General Electric used to be, moving one piece of production has downstream effects. â€œPart of that motor division, they had a place where they made their own wire,â€ said Witkowski. â€œThousands of jobs around the clock, making wire for all these motors. So when the motor department went out, the wire mills went out, too. â€ Under the union contracts of the time, those   workers who lost their jobs but had seniority at the company could â€œbumpâ€ less senior workers to stay at GE. â€œLetâ€™s say you were a lathe operator,â€ explained Witkowski. â€œWell, then you could bump a lathe operator somewhere else in the plant, as long as you had more seniority than them. And then that person might have to bump a   job, maybe a sweeper. Eventually, somebody had to go out on the street. â€ Or, as Chapadeau put it, â€œUntil, eventually, there was nobody left for you to bump, you went out of the street. â€ â€œEven though people could bump, the whole population was getting smaller and smaller and smaller,â€ explained Witkowski. â€œIf there was less machinists, then they needed less electricians, less carpenters, less steelworkers, less painters, less maintenance people. â€ â€œI know a lot of people that got laid off that I worked with, maybe they went somewhere to a machine tool company in Albany and worked as electricians,â€ added Witkowski. â€œBut they didnâ€™t make the kind of money they made at GE. They didnâ€™t have the benefits. â€ â€œIn the 80s, we got into [laying off] people with 12, 13 yearsâ€ of service, Chapadeau added. â€œFirst time I got laid off was 85, came back in 86. Then got laid off in 87, came back in 90. â€ By then, he had enough seniority to last until he retired in 2015.  Like Chapadeau, those people who did find work almost always responded to a recall notice, if they got one, because the money and benefits were better at GE  â€”   even if they knew they might get laid off again. â€œI kind of described it like a rollercoaster ride,â€ Witkowski added. The downsizings didnâ€™t just affect people who worked at GE. There were businesses  â€”   like Sears Roebuck, the uniform company Rudnicks and little lunch places  â€”   that stood just outside GEâ€™s gates on Erie Boulevard to cater to   and   workers on their lunch breaks.  â€œThey would run buses from inside the plant and drop you off down in front of Proctors, mainly for the secretaries, who had an hour. Theyâ€™d go to lunch, theyâ€™d go shopping. Thousands of â€™em,â€ Witkowski explained. â€œAnd a lot of people would just walk up Erie Boulevard, the people that had an hour for lunch, and just go. â€ â€œEverybody was out spending money on their lunch hour. And all those stores were thriving,â€ he added. â€œAnd then when they laid everybody off, well, you know what happened with downtown Schenectadyâ€ he said.  Little businesses closed, empty storefronts abounded, nothing seemed to be able to stay in business. â€œWhen you drive by the GE and look out and see green and a running track or a soccer field, thatâ€™s where there was buildings, thatâ€™s where there was jobs,â€ he said. â€œAll those people. Everybody buying homes, buying cars. Even in Schenectady, there was a lot of car dealerships, you would drive up State Street, there was car dealerships. Thatâ€™s all gone, too. â€ The ripples didnâ€™t stop there. Though Phillips, the engineer, wasnâ€™t directly affected by the rounds of layoffs and downsizing, heâ€™s got plenty of examples of the impact on his life as well. â€œWe go to First United Methodist in Schenectady,â€ he explained. â€œWhen GE was booming, church was full of people. â€ â€œOur church will seat about 600, but on a typical Sunday we typically have less than 100,â€ he added. â€œAnd thatâ€™s been a fact of    people donâ€™t work here any more. And the people that do work here, not as many of them live downtown, they live in the suburbs. â€ Schenectady Countyâ€™s population peaked in 1970 by 1980, it had dropped down to below 1960 levels and kept going down until 2000. As the population has begun to grow again, so has median income   â€¦     and the number of people living below the poverty line.  Like Terry Phillipsâ€™s daughters, Bernie Witkowskiâ€™s son and Don Chapadeauâ€™s kids left the area for college and most didnâ€™t come back. Most of their high school classmates who stayed in the area arenâ€™t employed by GE  â€”   but, then, only a handful of people, compared with the early 70s, are employed by GE at all.  Signs of an economic resurgence in Schenectady  â€”   a new multiplex, a shining chain hotel on State Street, the coming casino  â€”   coexist uncomfortably with the areaâ€™s burgeoning homeless and   population, and   houses the city wonâ€™t tear down. Cars line up at the interstate   during the morning commute, and then speed past GE and into Albany.  Schenectady County isnâ€™t a bad place to live nowadays, but itâ€™s not the same as it was. Nobody feels like they have job security, even if median household incomes are rising nobody knows whatâ€™s next for the city, or for housing prices, or what their kids will do for work if they canâ€™t or donâ€™t want to go to college. And everybody has heard the promises from politicians that theyâ€™ll bring jobs back to the area: in 2011, President Obama visited GE with its CEO, Jeffrey Immelt, and talked about modernization and new investment in the facility for renewable energy, spurred on by a $5m grant and a package of tax breaks for the company. In November 2015, GE announced that they were moving that renewable energy business out of Schenectady and into France.

We are just a tool, we are just angels that God gave talent to, you know, to get these bad souls back to heaven and cleanse them. â€ The words flow unnervingly from the mouth of the policeman, a senior officer in the Philippines national police (PNP) as he explains his role in 87 killings in the past three months. Itâ€™s not about killing for pleasure, or being a â€œhomicidal maniacâ€ he says. There is a higher purpose at play.  â€œWe are here as angels. Like St Michael and St Gabriel, right,â€ he says. Well in excess of 3, 600 people have been killed in the Philippines since 1 July this year, when Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated as president and initiated his war on drugs and crime. More than half of those murders have been perpetrated by unknown vigilantes. The mass killings have sparked international concern from the United Nations to Barack Obama and his US administration, as well as from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Amnesty has issued warnings about the â€œclimate of lawlessness and fear that has gripped the countryâ€. The fear is that the Philippines has slipped into an era of the death squad. The situation is unlikely to have been helped by the presidentâ€™s own words and allegations made against him. Last week Duterte, after citing Hitler and the Holocaust, said he would happily â€œslaughterâ€ three million drug addicts. That was preceded by a revealing testimony at an ongoing senate inquiry last month, where a   assassin testified that Duterte, in his previous incarnation as the longtime mayor of the city of Davao, had ordered the killing of criminals and his opponents  â€”   and in one case even personally â€œfinished offâ€ an employee from the justice department with a   gun. Reports of such macabre acts have only added weight to stories about assassins currently employed by police to get rid of suspected drug pushers. Now, for the first time, a serving officer is revealing the inner workings of what he claims is an officially sanctioned, albeit secret, campaign to rid the streets of unwanted citizens.  In the past three months he claims dozens of individuals have been killed  â€”   or in Philippine police talk, â€œneutralisedâ€  â€”   by this officer and his â€œspecial opsâ€ team alone. It is the unknown side of Duterteâ€™s dirty drug war  â€”   but it hasnâ€™t come out of nowhere. The police officer sits beyond a beaded curtain in the back room of a Manila brothel as he begins to tell the story of his job. The officer, who the Guardian has independently verified as an active member of the national force, appears at ease here. He feels secure and chose this place to talk. â€œSometimes I just come here for a good nightâ€™s sleep,â€ he jokes, eyeing the single mattress in the nondescript private room, the old air conditioner the only thing on the walls, humming noisily in the tropical heat. Later he says brothels are discreet places for discussions that he doesnâ€™t want anyone to hear. But first he reveals what for many will be shocking details of his employment in a death squad. â€œThey have created us. The term is â€˜they have unleashed the beast from the cageâ€™ right, to neutralise those criminals,â€ he says. The officer claims he is part of one of 10 newly formed and highly secretive police special operations teams, each with 16 members. He claims the teams are coordinated to execute a list of targets: suspected drug users, dealers and criminals. The killings mostly take place at night, he says, with the officers hooded and dressed in all black. They set their watches, giving themselves one minute or two to extract target individuals from their houses and kill on the spot  â€”   swift, precise, no witnesses. He claims they then dump the bodies  â€”   in the next town or under a bridge  â€”   or they plaster masking tape around the head of the corpse and place a cardboard sign on the body that reads â€œdrug lordâ€ or â€œpusherâ€. â€œWe put placards in order for the media, in order for those investigating [the] bodies to redirect their investigation,â€ he explains, leading them to think: â€œâ€˜Why should I investigate this guy, he is a drug pusher, he is a rapist, never mind with that one, I will just investigate the others. Itâ€™s a good thing for him that happened to him. â€™â€ In the Philippines they have a term for it: â€œsalvageâ€ victim. Someone killed and dumped in the street or thrown in the river. A corpse that is later salvaged. There have been many killings lately, the officer jokes, that these days you can easily get away with any kind of murder: â€œYou can kill him, put masking tape on him and everybody is going to think that guy is a drug pusher. â€ The officer says he was first deployed just after Duterte was elected to his special operations team, which was being formed for national security. He recalls his first meeting in which superiors allegedly described what was to happen next. â€œAnd then they are briefing us that, â€˜From now on it will be a different story. All those pending cases that identified hardened criminals on drugs and hardened murderers, we are going to have to neutralise them, so thatâ€™s the order. We need your special skills. â€™â€ He says the team leader is contacted via radio and a specific code  â€”   each special ops officer is known by a numeric code  â€”   and told to report to base. There they are given a dossier of targets, files of drug dealers, users and criminals to â€œneutraliseâ€. â€œLike, for example, they will send us a picture, a profile of this individual,â€ explains the officer. â€œAutomatically, one or two of my team will go to the place where this individual dwells and then of course first we are going to conduct background checks. â€ The team investigates the individuals to determine whether they are involved in drug dealing or other illegal activities, whether they are â€œ â€ or a â€œparasiteâ€ and then acts accordingly. â€œSo thatâ€™s how we weigh him, so maybe we conduct our own justice,â€ he says. â€œAnd of course the government is ordering us to do so. â€ The officer, dressed in a red sports shirt and jeans, argues the special ops teams are doing a service for society, perhaps giving a hint at his motivation for speaking about such a sensitive subject. â€œWe are the kind of policemen that we donâ€™t just kill for pleasure,â€ he explains. â€œBut if we think this is a hardened individual or hardened criminal who makes his living as a parasite to others, well we will have no conscience. We are going to give him the worst death [so] that even Satan cannot look straightforward to him because he has a very bad death. â€ The allegations from the officer are shocking. And although the Guardian can verify the policemanâ€™s rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder. The environment in which the wave of killings is happening in the Philippines is murky and complicated, with several groups involved. First, under operation â€œDouble Barrelâ€ the police have been given a licence from the president to crack down on drugs and crime. Duterte has instructed the police to double, â€œtriple their efforts if need beâ€ and promised to grant amnesty to any officers involved if they somehow find themselves on the wrong side of the law as a result. Next come the vigilantes, and the more than 2, 200 murders perpetrated by these unknown assassins. The deaths have been put down to gangs, thugs and drug lords capitalising on the killing spree to get rid of rivals and enemies. The police have also admitted that corrupt officers, with the aim of protecting their narcotics rackets, could also be behind some of the vigilante killings. Then, most frightening and ominous, according to the officer who spoke to the Guardian, is the third category  â€”   highly orchestrated and trained   police death squads, such as the one this officer claims to be part of. For months now the news has been filled with a steady stream of grisly images, daily photographs of   dead bodies shot and slumped in the street. One local newspaper, the Inquirer, has even started a â€œkill listâ€ in an attempt to document the killings across the country. Of the   deaths so far, 1, 375 have been killed in   police operations, while about 2, 233 more have been put down to vigilantes, according to the latest statistics from the PNP from early September. The PNP says it is investigating the vigilantes, but so far there are no reports that any have been arrested. Inaugurated on 30 June, Duterte had been elected on a promise to rid the   Asian nation of drugs and crime within six months of taking office. The president has joked about fattening up the fish of Manila Bay with the corpses of drug dealers, and vowed the drug war wonâ€™t stop â€œuntil the last drug lord, last financier and last pusher have surrendered  â€”   or put behind bars, or below the ground if they so wishâ€. But it is not just the surge in killings on his watch that has invited international condemnation. Duterteâ€™s penchant for outlandish statements and insults, even of global leaders, has stunned the global community. Ahead of a planned meeting with the US president, Barack Obama, on the sidelines of an Asean meeting in Laos this August, Duterte branded his US counterpart a â€œson of a whoreâ€ for signalling his intention to talk about human rights amid the spate of killings.  Before that it was UN officials and the US ambassador to the Philippines. In June it was the press. â€œJust because youâ€™re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if youâ€™re a son of a bitch,â€ he said. He later retracted that, saying he did not condone the killing of journalists, and he also rowed back on his Obama comments, saying the insult was not directed at the president. It was the same with the Jewish community too and his Holocaust comment. Duterte, after the fact, apparently didnâ€™t mean what he said. But the more criticism that flies in from abroad, the more impervious the president has become  â€”   warning global leaders not to mess with Philippine sovereignty, while setting out to undermine and publicly ridicule anyone who questions him. So far he appears to have the public on his side  â€”   a July poll by Pulse Asia Research showed his approval rating at 91%. Indeed, in Manila talk of   death squads doesnâ€™t raise many eyebrows. â€œOnly in the Philippinesâ€ was an   refrain. As mayor of Davao, a city in Mindanao in the southern Philippines, Duterte developed a reputation both for curbing crime and for links to the alleged Davao death squads (DDS) that executed drug dealers, petty criminals and street children, some of whom were part of gangs. Impunity for such crimes was almost absolute according to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Entitled You Can Die At Any Time, it detailed evidence of complicity and at times direct involvement between government officials and the police in the squads. That same year Duterte said that criminals were a â€œlegitimate target of assassinationâ€. According to the report, police officers would give death squad members lists of targets. After being notified of the murders by members of the public, authorities were slow to respond, even when they occurred just minutes away from police stations. The report describes how the Davao police often failed to collect obvious pieces of evidence such as used bullet casings or question witnesses or suspects, instead pressuring the families of victims to identify the killers. Investigations went nowhere. In 2012 the Commission on Human Rights recommended the ombudsman investigate Duterte for criminal liability in relation to the killings, but no charges were ever brought and no evidence found. Instead 21 police officers were reportedly fined the equivalent of one monthâ€™s salary after they were found guilty of neglecting their duty.  The chief of the PNP, Ronald dela Rosa  â€”   the former city police chief of Davao who was handpicked for the national job by Duterte  â€”   has, like the government, denied the existence of the DDS.  Even after the stunning allegations at the senate hearing when Duterteâ€™s name was directly linked to mass killings, Dela Rosa dismissed the DDS as a â€œcreation of the mediaâ€. Davao is not the only place where it is claimed that death squads have operated and the concern now is that the tactics allegedly used in that city have been scaled up nationwide.  â€œI think itâ€™s extremely credible,â€ says Brad Adams, the executive director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch, speaking both about that notion and the claims of the police officer in his Guardian interview. â€œThat police officers are given a list of targets to kill is not shocking or surprising. It is however important, essential, that the police admit this so that Duterte canâ€™t hide behind the idea that this is all the work of vigilantes and   actors. â€œThere is no doubt there is state sponsorship and police involvement,â€ Adams claims. â€œWe were concerned about Davao being replicated or metastasising around the country. â€. At the Philippines national police headquarters, even the police themselves admit active officers could be behind a number of the vigilante killings. A police briefing document on project Double Barrel shows that from 1 July to 16 August, 250 officers were relieved from their duties in metro Manila because of suspected links to the drug trade. But any official relationship between police and vigilantes  â€”   such as the one described by the officer to the Guardian  â€”   are denied. The Philippine National Police was contacted on numerous occasions by the Guardian to comment on the allegations detailed in this story. Although they did acknowledge requests from the Guardian regarding the matter, no official comment was forthcoming. But the previous responses from Duterte himself to allegations of involvement in death squads have been strong. He has called them lies and â€œaccusations of a madmanâ€ and previously stated that there were â€œno Davao death squadsâ€. Martin Andanar, Duterteâ€™s communications secretary, said of the Davao allegations: â€œThe Commission on Human Rights already conducted an investigation years ago, when the president was still a mayor, and charges were not filed, they did not see any direct evidence. â€ When contacted by the Guardian to respond to the specific allegations of the police officer, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said he was unable to comment. â€œI cannot make any comments regarding that,â€ he said. â€œThere are   sources and we cannot verify what they are saying, they have not made an affidavit. I cannot make any statement because it is not verified. â€ For Arsenio â€œBoyâ€ Evangelista Jr, spokesman for the group Victims against Crime and Corruption, the denials and no comments mean little. â€œWho would have the skills and the guts to do this?â€ he says when he talks about the mass killings. â€œI am talking of police skills, all the skills, like intelligence, proficiency in handling firearms,â€ says Evangelista, who six years after his son was killed in a brutal crime is still waiting for someone to be charged. â€œBecause thatâ€™s what is happening lately. Itâ€™s practically perfect. No witnesses  â€”   it is being done very accurate, swift. â€ At the Philippines Commission on Human Rights, Chito Gascon, its chairman, is asked about the allegations of police acting as judge, jury and executioner. He too is unfazed. â€œI am not surprised, I have heard of this. But the problem is we need to prove it. â€œAnd it probably follows a playbook that has been used before, like in Davao. â€ Gascon says he is grappling with the new presidentâ€™s apparent take on human rights: if youâ€™re a good guy, you get them if youâ€™re a bad guy, you donâ€™t. Itâ€™s a slippery slope but this appears to be the logic at the heart of the surge in killings: the justification necessary to rid the country of the scourge of drugs and crime, the end that justifies the means. In his Manila brothel the police officer admits that he too contemplates that very point. â€œMaybe, I am just having, what do you call it, just pretending that we are right. But we are not homicidal maniacs right now. â€œI told you a while ago, we pray, we always go to the church, and ask forgiveness to God for what we are doing right now. We are sorry for doing it. But whoever gonna do it for the Filipino people?â€",717,727,"973026891727765506	973055206542909440	973155530293334016	973159775948234752	973239603699245056	973269949299871745	973315556483981313	973982221488009216	973994737576247296",fake

Papers filed in a Washington DC federal court on Tuesday allege that DynCorp, a fixture of wartime US contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, knowingly inflated costs during a   stretch when the company held a contract with the US state department for training Iraqi police. Since 2010, DynCorp has held a contract with the US defense department for training Afghanistanâ€™s ministry of defense and its own national police. DynCorp essentially inherited that contract thanks to a prior deal for the same Afghan police training with the state department that began in 2003.  The company received an extension on that contract in March under limited competition. Although in the past the contract was worth approximately $1bn over three years, the dollar value on the reaward, a far shorter period, was redacted.  While the justice department does not precisely estimate how much the alleged fraud cost the US, it states that DynCorpâ€™s deal for the services at issue in the filing led to the firm receiving $135m from the state department.  In a statement provided to the Guardian, DynCorp said it was â€œdisappointedâ€ by the fraud accusation and â€œlooks forward to responding to the complaintâ€™s allegations in courtâ€.  The fraud allegation against DynCorp stems from a subcontractor it used, Corporate Bank, during a period from 2004 to 2008 when it held the Iraqi police training contract. According to the justice department complaint, DynCorp was aware that rates from the subcontractor  â€”   for hotels for US government officials, local security personnel, drivers and interpreters  â€”   were â€œunreasonableâ€ yet the firm billed them to the state department anyway. â€œDynCorpâ€™s invoices, which reflected these inflated subcontractor rates, and DynCorpâ€™s own fees and   were false and fraudulent claims,â€ the complaint alleges.  DynCorp, which provides private security guards as well as aviation and logistics services, was not among seven contractors awarded state department contracts in February to protect its diplomats. It was a departure for state, which has included the security company on its previous awards of its Worldwide Protective Services contract, most recently in 2010.  Yet the firm currently holds contracts with the US department of defense, according to a federal contracting database, atop the Afghanistan interior ministry training deal.  Among them is an air force contract for supplying materiel relevant to a training aircraft for which DynCorp was the sole bidder, and an army contract for support services at a base in Honduras. A different contract, with the navy for maintenance on test aircraft, is set to expire on 31 July.  According to the justice department complaint, DynCorp management called its subcontractor Corporate Bankâ€™s labor and hotel rates â€œexpensiveâ€ during an internal presentation, without the subcontractor providing evidence justifying the costs. DynCorp allegedly presented those rates to the state department as justified by â€œhistorical dataâ€ or a â€œvendor quoteâ€ and is alleged to have billed the government for unoccupied hotel rooms. In 2005, according to the complaint, a DynCorp   worried that the company â€œwould not win the CIVPOL [civilian police] Iraq business back if we allow these outrageous rates to continueâ€. As well as the hotel costs, Corporate Bank is alleged to have inflated the labor costs for personnel it supplied DynCorp for security and transport, resulting in the state department paying what the complaint says is over $1m in false claims while DynCorp â€œprofited by recovering its own markups and fees on its subcontractorâ€™s inflated chargesâ€. DynCorp, in a statement, denied the justice departmentâ€™s allegations. The company said it stopped doing business with Corporate Bank â€œmany years agoâ€ and claimed that the US government itself proposed using the subcontractor. â€œThe suit is an    attempt to   certain labor and housing costs charged nearly a decade ago by a subcontractor in Iraq which was recommended to DynCorp International by the US government,â€ DynCorpâ€™s statement said.  The Afghan police, which DynCorp still has a role in training and mentoring, have long faced criticism for corruption and unreliable performance. A US government watchdog testified in February that its audits indicated the police claiming payroll for nonexistent employees. DynCorpâ€™s latest contract extension lasts through September, with options for two   extensions.

politifact13584,steemit.com/news/@gaucher/donald-trump-dead-from-a-fatal-heart-attack,Donald Trump Dead From A Fatal HEART ATTACK! — Steemit,"With their dangerous crusade for an   bill in Congress all but dead (for now) the FBI and US justice department are now engaged in a   attack on all sorts of other privacy rights  â€”   this time, with much less public scrutiny. A report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office harshly criticized the FBI last week for its little discussed but frequently used facial recognition database and called on the bureau to implement myriad privacy and safety protections. It turns out the database has far more photos than anyone thought  â€”   411. 9m to be exact  â€”   and the vast majority are not mugshots of criminals, but driverâ€™s license photos from over a dozen states and passport photos of millions of completely innocent people. The feds searched it over 36, 000 times from 2011 to 2015 (no court order needed) while also apparently having no idea how accurate it is. Worse, the FBI wants its hundreds of millions of facial recognition photos  â€”   along with its entire biometric database that includes fingerprints and DNA profiles  â€”   to be exempt from important Privacy Act protections. As the Intercept reported two weeks ago: â€œSpecifically, the FBIâ€™s proposal would exempt the database from the provisions in the Privacy Act that require federal agencies to share with individuals the information they collect about them and that give people the legal right to determine the accuracy and fairness of how their personal information is collected and used. â€ In Congress, Senate Republicans are pushing for a vote this week on controversial new warrantless surveillance measures that would let the FBI use unconstitutional National Security Letters to get email records and internet browsing history from countless US citizens  â€”   without going to a judge or court at all. The Senate leadership is bringing the measure up to vote by invoking the Orlando attack, despite the fact that we know the FBI had no problem surveilling the Orlando killer when he was previously investigated. It is a blatant attempt to exploit the tragedy in order to gain powers the FBI has long asked for (powers, by the way, the FBI is already reportedly using, despite the justice department telling them itâ€™s basically illegal). The justice department, meanwhile, is busy attempting to implement a new rule for the court system that would make it much easier for the FBI to hack into computers worldwide  â€”   including those of hacking victims. Using the obscure process for amending the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the department has convinced the courts that they should be able to get one warrant to potentially hack thousands of computers, and shouldnâ€™t have to comply with the normal rules involving getting the court order in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation has noted, â€œthis is a recipe for disaster,â€ and it is being done by circumventing the normal democratic process. Several organizations (including Freedom of the Press Foundation, the organization I work for) have called on Congress to put a stop to it. Also in the courts, the justice department has continued to argue that the US government doesnâ€™t need a warrant to gather the cell phone location information of Americans  â€”   even though that type of information can give authorities your precise whereabouts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The justice department convinced the fourth circuit court of appeals last month to overturn its previous ruling that police need a probable cause warrant to get such information. The court agreed with the justice department that cellphone users donâ€™t have a â€œreasonable expectation of privacyâ€ around their location, even though it is some of the most intimate information that exists, giving law enforcement officials a detailed picture of your life that even your close friends and family may not know. Last year, the FBI director disingenuously tried to claim that the pendulum â€œhas swung too farâ€ in the way of privacy, despite the fact that the agency has virtually unprecedented access to all sorts of information on Americans.

A post to his official Facebook page on Thursday 10 November announced the musicianâ€™s passing in Los Angeles. â€œIt is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away. We have lost one of musicâ€™s most revered and prolific visionaries,â€ the post said.  â€œA memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief. â€ According to the Leonard Cohen forum, often well informed on the singer, he died on Monday 7 November and has already been buried in a private ceremony in Montreal. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Cohen spoke about the prospect of death with calmness and clarity: â€œI am ready to die. I hope itâ€™s not too uncomfortable. Thatâ€™s about it for me. â€ Tributes poured in across social media for the Canadian musician, who had just released his 14th album, You Want It Darker, in October, to great acclaim. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said the â€œworld will miss himâ€ while  actors Rob Lowe and Russell Crowe, musicians Ben Folds, Peter Hook, Slash, Carole King, Lily Allen and Bette Midler all heaped praise on the star. Cohen, who was born in Montreal, came to prominence in the 1960s as a poet, novelist and  . Originally focusing on literary pursuits, he shifted his attention to music in the late 60s when he moved to New York. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in 1967 and became a cult hit. Cohenâ€™s influence on the music industry has been likened to that of his contemporaries Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell and is perhaps best known for his song Hallelujah. Only a modest hit on its release in 1984, it found a much wider audience after it was covered by John Cale in 1991 and by Jeff Buckley in 1994.  After the song was taken to No 1 in the UK by   winner Alexandra Burke in 2008, Cohen said: â€œI think itâ€™s a good song, but I think too many people sing it. â€ Despite his immense popularity, Cohen often appeared to be shy of the stage. Judy Collins, who had success with his song Suzanne, once described how she had to coax him back on stage after he left halfway through a performance. He came out of retirement in his late 70s to embark what would end up being a   worldwide tour, after his former manager, Kelley Lynch, was found guilty of stealing millions of dollars from him.  Cohen recently wrote a letter to his longtime muse, Marianne Ihlen, who was the subject of his songs So Long, Marianne, and Bird on a Wire, saying: â€œYou know that Iâ€™ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I donâ€™t need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road. â€ For much of the 1960s, he lived with Ihlen on the Greek island of Hydra, during which time he wrote numerous books of poetry, including his experimental novel Beautiful Losers, and his first album.  In the 1970s, after his relationship with Ihlen dissolved, Cohen began a relationship with the artist Suzanne Elrod. The couple had two children, Adam and Lorca.  You Want It Darker was   by Adam Cohen. Speaking recently with CBC Radio host Tom Power, he talked about working with his father on the album that many believed would be his last. â€œThis old man, who was truly in pain and discomfort, would at some intervals get out of his medical chair and dance in front of his speakers,â€ he said. â€œAnd sometimes, we would put on a song and listen to it on repeat just like teenagers, with the help of medical marijuana. â€œI think in states of pain and discomfort, what do you seek with more energy and more clarity than joy and jubilance?â€ Adam described his father as â€œthe last of his kindâ€. â€œUnlike so many from that golden era, from which he comes, heâ€™s not a nostalgia act,â€ he said. â€œThis guy is speaking from his particular vantage point, heâ€™s speaking about things that are meaningful to him at his particular rung in life  â€”   he will be leaving a giant void when he leaves us. â€  You Want It Darker added to an impressive body of work. Cohenâ€™s second album, 1969â€™s Songs for a Room, featured what would become one of his most popular songs, Bird on the Wire. The song has been covered by artists including Johnny Cash, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, kd lang and Paul Kelly. Kris Kristofferson once said that he wanted the opening lyrics from Bird on the Wire engraved on his tombstone. A year later, Cohen embarked upon an intense period of touring through Europe, Canada and the United States. He released his third album, Songs of Love and Hate, in 1971, which included the song Famous Blue Raincoat. The song, with its haunting depiction of the aftermath of a love triangle, was   by fans, but Cohen reportedly told BBC in 1994 that he was never quite happy with the lyrics. Cohenâ€™s next two albums, New Skin for the Old Ceremony and Death of a Ladiesâ€™ Man, marked a shift to a new sound and a dip in his popularity. The latter was also an album fuelled by controversy at one point during recording, producer Phil Spector reportedly held a gun to Cohenâ€™s head in the studio. In addition to giving his song Hallelujah a major boost, covers played a significant role and helped Cohen find a new audience in the late 80s, when the American artist Jennifer Warnes released a tribute album to him, effectively refashioning his image in the public eye. Cohen was born into a Jewish family, but in the 1970s he began to devote significant attention to studying Buddhism. He met and became a disciple of Joshu Sasaki Roshi, a Zen Buddhist monk. Between 1994 and 1999, Cohen lived as the monkâ€™s friend and student at the Mount Baldy Zen Center in Los Angeles. Cohen continued to record and tour in the 1980s and early 90s. He released his album Ten New Songs in 2001, after emerging from the monastery, launching a new phase of his already   career.  Cohen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.

But beware of laughing too much: the joke might be on us. Yes, Trump tweets like a buffoon. But we should not assume that all the missteps by the petulant    are down to ignorance: they arenâ€™t. Too many of Trumpâ€™s troubling tweets arenâ€™t actually gaffes. He is intentionally blowing up global stability for the sake of an extremist agenda concocted by hawkish aides who make Dick Cheney look like Kofi Annan. Thatâ€™s why the strange case of the Taiwan telephone call is worth examining because it is surely a sign of things to come. At first, Team Trump dismissed the call with the Taiwanese president Tsai   as an innocent congratulatory message. Mike Pence, the   elect, suggested it was no big deal, telling ABC it was â€œnothing more than taking a courtesy callâ€.  These excuses seemed weak after foreign policy experts predicted the Taiwan call would lead to a major breach with US policy, which has been in place since 1979. Then, they fell apart after the New York Times reported that the call was the result of a   and   lobbying effort by the Taiwanese themselves. According to the New York Times, it was all orchestrated by its paid foreign agent, Bob Dole, the former Republican presidential nominee and Senate leader. â€œItâ€™s fair to say that we had some influence,â€ Dole said. â€œWhen you represent a client, and they make requests, youâ€™re supposed to respond. â€ That influence included special attention at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, attended by a Taiwanese delegation, where the party platform was changed for the first time to include several commitments to Taiwanâ€™s security. Another   might consider such   from national security dangerous, disloyal or worse. But Taiwan newspapers have reported that the Trump Organization itself is interested in a possible hotel project close to Taiwanâ€™s international airport. According to the report, a sales manager visited Taiwan as recently as October, although a spokeswoman for the business said there were â€œno plans for expansion into Taiwan. â€ Perhaps the Taiwan phone call is as innocent as Trumpâ€™s meeting with his Indian business partners just days before his business signed a new deal in Kolkata. Perhaps his phone call with the Argentine president has nothing to do with the   of a   Buenos Aires tower. Trump could sweep aside such questions by divesting himself entirely from his ownership of the Trump Organization, and not just stepping away from its operations, as he has suggested he will do at a big league press conference next week. Anything short of full divestment  â€”   even a blind trust  â€”   will be meaningless. Under the US constitutionâ€™s prohibition against payments and benefits from foreign powers to the president, every piece of planning permission and investment would be grounds for impeachment. In any case, these phone calls and policy shifts are beginning to follow a pattern, whether or not Ivanka Trump is taking part. First there is a stunned reaction from foreign policy experts and the media at the brazen disregard for protocol and national interest. Then there is an attempt to explain away the dramatic shift as an inexperienced gaffe. Finally there is a realization that we have all been gamed by a manipulative and secret coterie that is in fact Trumpâ€™s inner circle. So it was that Trump himself explained the Taiwan call initially as him casually picking up the phone. â€œThe President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency,â€ he tweeted last week. â€œThank you!â€ It wasnâ€™t clear who he was thanking in that tweet, but it was clear soon afterwards that the story was falling apart.  At which point, Trumpâ€™s excuse on Twitter turned towards punishing China: â€œDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the US doesnâ€™t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I donâ€™t think so!â€ We could argue all day about international taxes, and how the US actually imposes tariffs on Chinese goods. But whatâ€™s the point of talking about the facts with a man like Donald Trump? What matters much more are his motives, and for now they go far beyond the notion that heâ€™s a simpleton. We may have returned to the satirical heyday of Will Ferrellâ€™s George W Bush, but the jokes donâ€™t tell the full story.  Trump has a personal and political agenda that are far from the clueless caricatures that puncture his   skin. The sooner we wake up to that punchline, the better.",651,217,"1011426442842865664	1011426654655336448	1011426942384594944	1011426997141204992	1011427230835146752	1011428519732236288	1011428547876081667	1011438227994169346	1011444931007836160	1011455691406630912	1011455871405223938	1011465918214438912	1011466875014823936	1011472359625187328	1011474125691318272	1011479360430321664	1011540974378668033	1011556971302940672	1011558344702582784	1011560993913122817	1011563514769616897	1011567988745654272	1011571089703604229	1011574472074235904	1011575327385059329	1011575438014140417	1011578217751351296	1011578263225892864	1011581001833832449	1011584391754104833	1011586535668502529	1011592311384440833	1011596766058180608	1011600168075055105	1011603548818296839	1011604388887040001	1011605963449749506	1011605987424432128	1011611159403859968	1011611234184069120	1011612431460831232	1011612494727712769	1011621575815135232	1011626246424293376	1011632134086422528	1011632503478784005	1011644906023071744	1011652636305772546	1011657192536203265	1011658370195918849	1011662096461754368	1011683035450957824	1011689883893628933	1011697459989483520	1011704367760605184	1011711043054292992	1011713163685793792	1011713853036597252	1011714338321846273	1011715289665490944	1011715631471710208	1011716208490528768	1011719939663826944	1011720789580627968	1011721204804141056	1011723365374218241	1011731836446203905	1011733105277796353	1011734359106301952	1011737384197808128	1011743316604416000	1011759031134740480	1011760546046140416	1011768480021008384	1011768826583805952	1011778126869925888	1011795771056971776	1011803790591381504	1011822290080817152	1011823774348513280	1011832026486304769	1011834840889548800	1011835541535514624	1011906027942490112	1011942910902788096	1011960163652329473	1011968331103064064	1011971287303016448	1011973875549253632	1012045014426365953	1012074835529302016	1012145642179891202	1012152957205450752	1012157268006141952	1012334996047032321	1012344518077767680	1012415188039942144	1012415968964956161	1012442083041402880	1012464040038322178	1012481497645740032	1012495840315920384	1012532776468471808	1013102614605647877	1014156420588146688	1015061430951923712	1021061011930075137	1021097519810469888	1021444499673763841	1022959402666614784	1050915519799406593",fake

The reality, as Willis and Andy Murray know, is somewhat different. Murray, the world No2, has just been voted on to the ATP playersâ€™ council and hopes he can do some good for players on the outer fringes of the game. As he prepared for his   match against the world No76 Lu    â€”   who embarrassed him at the Beijing Olympics in 2008  â€”   Murray reflected on the dilemma facing the   Willis, No772 in the world, as well as other   British players such as Liam Broady, whom he defeated in three sets on Tuesday. â€œThe first thing is we need to improve the prize money at Futures level,â€ Murray said of the lowest rung of menâ€™s professional tennis. â€œI think itâ€™s stayed the same since the 1980s, but the cost of everything has gone up massively since then, so itâ€™s impossible to stay at that level for more than a couple of years. â€ Willis revealed that he returned from his last proper tournament, in Tunisia in January, with just â‚¬60. â€œYou are losing money unless you are winning each week,â€ Murray added. â€œSo, for the guys that are stuck there for a couple of years, playing   and   you simply cannot fund your career that way. â€œThe first thing is you have to improve the prize money at the lowest level. Itâ€™s been going up everywhere else, at the top of the game, massively. But that hasnâ€™t filtered down to the bottom of the game. Thatâ€™s something that needs to change. â€ Was there a danger, then, that talented players could disappear under the radar? Murray was unequivocal. â€œPlayers are breaking through later than they ever were before, they are finding ways to hang around. A lot of the guys play club tennis [as Willis does, in Germany and France] to try to make some extra money, which helps. We donâ€™t have that in this country. You can travel to Europe and do that. In Spain they have a few more money tournaments. â€œSomeone like Marcus, if he had lost in the   at Wimbledon, we wouldnâ€™t have this unbelievable story and he might not be coming back to play [on the Tour] in January. You never know. â€œThere has to be more money at the bottom of the game. Some of the $10, 000 tournaments, they have a   qualifying draw and itâ€™s $30 to enter the qualifying. Thatâ€™s a lot of money that doesnâ€™t go to the players. The players at that level really need the money. â€ That said, Murray will not be gifting Lu Â£80, 000 here on Thursday to advance into the third round. Murray has started at a great lick, beating Broady in just an hour and 42 minutes, and needs another quick win to settle into the tournament  â€”   unlike his slow start to the French Open last week. And he has the incentive of getting square for losing to Lu in in Beijing, when he got caught up in the euphoria of the occasion. That will not happen in Rio, he promised. â€œI learned that I was there to play tennis and not just enjoy being part of the Olympics. I turned up late because I had won Cincinnati. I did the opening ceremony and I was hanging out with a lot of the other athletes, stayed in the village. It was great, a great experience. But, when I lost, I was gutted. I realised that my job at the Olympics is to try to win a medal for the country. â€ That is the main reason he will stay with his team away from the village this time. â€œYeah, and I donâ€™t know what the accommodation is like   either. â€œIdeally you would go to the opening ceremony and stay in the Olympic Village. But that didnâ€™t work for me in Beijing. At the Olympics in London, I stayed at home. I was just a lot more focused and in my own little bubble. It was one of the best weeks of my life, so Iâ€™m not going to change that this time. â€ Murray and his Taiwanese opponent have other history, which is more encouraging for the Scot: each time he has played Lu in a Tour event or slam, he has gone on to win it, here in 2013 and at Queenâ€™s last year. â€œI didnâ€™t remember that I played him last year,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m not superstitious like that. â€",908,503,"886121495377752064	886252630288322561	886252699523698689	886253090885840896	886253331600953344	886253337334521856	886253360990502913	886253402321297408	886253564544397314	886253575361273856	886253620076974081	886253663257321472	886253764251971585	886254237495197697	886254270877765633	886254289076793345	886254427090411520	886254492869701632	886255042776399872	886255929255227392	886256277239844864	886258537202032640	886258580621590530	886259405079146496	886260381785534464	886261584338735104	886261653809111040	886261822004899840	886263136113704960	886264539611889664	886264681471459328	886264687486091264	886265059139256321	886265083021504512	886267402195001348	886268038613303296	886268829319389184	886270948269330432	886272223983620101	886272813530845185	886277833332600832	886278024471220225	886278464319475712	886278773523582980	886281274989486081	886282349926903808	886284759260839936	886285629558009856	886286142651367424	886287728794632192	886288681316753408	886290065852219392	886293708664180736	886294973259403264	886295040204689408	886295237433282560	886295825768435712	886296676419461122	886296705733361665	886298916697853952	886299292998258689	886300025826885633	886300037596274688	886301919257522176	886303683625070592	886304432325054464	886306741620809729	886307434184290305	886307437216751616	886309608146567168	886310569292079104	886317420935249920	886318141218803712	886320125179080704	886321231259197440	886323973503496192	886327130585432065	886327462769995776	886329344745930754	886330063767130113	886337194083799041	886344440251637761	886345387505840128	886346770397110272	886348167855386626	886349355124482052	886351625471893505	886354930658947079	886357262163488768	886357995629694976	886358568386965506	886361754724425728	886363243626864640	886367655019646978	886368382274215936	886369660551221248	886377521239003137	886380035082526721	886390714740989952	886396001640165377	886401598121013248	886405642449276928	886407880471191552	886416762337542144	886418552860934144	886420461327982592	886424130576318465	886427873787117568	886431833243754496	886433430493417472	886433947114237952	886440502350032896	886443284989661184	886446086071758853	886456976225570816	886466702086721536	886469213702979585	886496640579780608	886510942762258432	886531058891710464	886536747689144325	886548289755250688	886552254853066754	886553772658495488	886553898684751872	886554797901570048	886561416538357761	886565780413984768	886567368717217792	886570876392660993	886572565497597953	886573055618633730	886573053366415360	886576482931412992	886576712754089985	886579994729775104	886588150835023877	886591287322923015	886591969765580802	886593077640663040	886595505429598209	886597433098211328	886598147149090817	886602697201287172	886610698951905284	886618030586724353	886622039955656705	886624093407248384	886624254367854593	886624264702443520	886626125014847489	886626735508402177	886633954618613762	886639929408630785	886640190353268738	886641196424060930	886641590017675265	886657703438897153	886662533607804928	886673673779728384	886687587338932228	886688146183733253	886697981357031425	886700901280428032	886708617512050688	886711794433220608	886844690896760834	886859811106807808	886901774157787136	886936670720974849	886948917748879361	887021797446623232	887072079736184832	887393595245965313	887470492575248384	889297360169295872	902987534950703104	904438780714782720	923744902567137280	928623386707808256	928625616647344129	942248260667891713",fake

We expect that he will act with this perspective in mind. â€ On Thursday, in his annual state of the nation address, Putin said he hoped to mend   relations after years of bitter disagreement, economic sanctions and conflict via opposing factions, as in Syria and Ukraine.  â€œWe are ready to cooperate with the new American administration,â€ Putin told lawmakers and officials at the Kremlin. â€œItâ€™s important to normalize and start to develop our bilateral relations on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. â€ Trump, who has been accused of being too close to the Putin regime, has said he wants â€œto get along with Russiaâ€ and restore military cooperation in the Middle East.  In the interview broadcast on Sunday, Putin said western leaders should listen more closely to views from governments in Russia and the Middle East. â€œThey listen to those whose voices are loud enough to be heard,â€ he said. â€œAnd if itâ€™s some insignificant issue in international relations, then, of course, you can save face. But the game will still turn out poorly with regard to those who were not considered important enough partners. â€ In his speech, Putin said he expected to work with the US in the Middle East, where Russian forces have for months bombed Syrian cities that are not under the control of his ally, Bashar  .  Barack Obama has called for Assad to step down, but US efforts to negotiate with Russia and Syria  â€”   while fighting jihadi groups and supporting rebels  â€”   have repeatedly failed. â€œOf course I am counting on joining forces with the United States in the fight with the real, not invented, threat of international terrorism,â€ Putin said. Last month, in their first phone call after the US election, Trump and Putin spoke about cooperation and â€œthe principles of equality, mutual respect and   in the internal affairs of each otherâ€ according to a Kremlin account of the call.  Russian officials have long accused counterparts in the Obama administration of meddling abroad, for instance in 2011, when Putin claimed that Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, was fomenting dissent against him within Russia. Trumpâ€™s transition team said the   told Putin he was â€œvery much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russiaâ€. Officials in the Obama administration accused Russia of hacking Democratic party servers as a ploy to interfere with the election, which Putin denied. Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Putinâ€™s â€œstrongâ€ leadership. Trump also falsely said that Putin had called him â€œa geniusâ€. The Russian president actually called Trump â€œflamboyantâ€ and â€œtalentedâ€. Trumpâ€™s foreign policy intentions remain largely unknown, and in his Thursday speech Putin did not fully embrace the  . He warned, for instance, that the US and Russia had a â€œshared responsibilityâ€ to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, a nod to Trumpâ€™s suggestion that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear arms.  â€œAttempts to break strategic parity are extremely dangerous,â€ Putin said. Trump has not named his choice for secretary of state, the diplomat who would lead US affairs abroad.

politifact13943,http://www.wilmingtonfilm.com/,Wilmington Regional Film Commission,"What greater indictment of a system could there be than an epidemic of mental illness? Yet plagues of anxiety, stress, depression, social phobia, eating disorders,   and loneliness now strike people down all over the world. The latest, catastrophic figures for childrenâ€™s mental health in England reflect a global crisis. There are plenty of secondary reasons for this distress, but it seems to me that the underlying cause is everywhere the same: human beings, the ultrasocial mammals, whose brains are wired to respond to other people, are being peeled apart. Economic and technological change play a major role, but so does ideology. Though our wellbeing is inextricably linked to the lives of others, everywhere we are told that we will prosper through competitive   and extreme individualism. In Britain, men who have spent their entire lives in quadrangles  â€”   at school, at college, at the bar, in parliament  â€”   instruct us to stand on our own two feet. The education system becomes more brutally competitive by the year. Employment is a fight to the   with a multitude of other desperate people chasing ever fewer jobs. The modern overseers of the poor ascribe individual blame to economic circumstance. Endless competitions on television feed impossible aspirations as real opportunities contract. Consumerism fills the social void. But far from curing the disease of isolation, it intensifies social comparison to the point at which, having consumed all else, we start to prey upon ourselves. Social media brings us together and drives us apart, allowing us precisely to quantify our social standing, and to see that other people have more friends and followers than we do. As Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett has brilliantly documented, girls and young women routinely alter the photos they post to make themselves look smoother and slimmer. Some phones, using their â€œbeautyâ€ settings, do it for you without asking now you can become your own thinspiration. Welcome to the   dystopia: a war of everyone against themselves. Is it any wonder, in these lonely inner worlds, in which touching has been replaced by retouching, that young women are drowning in mental distress? A recent survey in England suggests that one in four women between 16 and 24 have harmed themselves, and one in eight now suffer from   stress disorder. Anxiety, depression, phobias or obsessive compulsive disorder affect 26% of women in this age group. This is what a public health crisis looks like. If social rupture is not treated as seriously as broken limbs, it is because we cannot see it. But neuroscientists can. A series of fascinating papers suggest that social pain and physical pain are processed by the same neural circuits. This might explain why, in many languages, it is hard to describe the impact of breaking social bonds without the words we use to denote physical pain and injury. In both humans and other social mammals, social contact reduces physical pain. This is why we hug our children when they hurt themselves: affection is a powerful analgesic. Opioids relieve both physical agony and the distress of separation. Perhaps this explains the link between social isolation and drug addiction. Experiments summarised in the journal Physiology  Behaviour last month suggest that, given a choice of physical pain or isolation, social mammals will choose the former. Capuchin monkeys starved of both food and contact for 22 hours will rejoin their companions before eating. Children who experience emotional neglect, according to some findings, suffer worse mental health consequences than children suffering both emotional neglect and physical abuse: hideous as it is, violence involves attention and contact.   is often used as an attempt to alleviate distress: another indication that physical pain is not as bad as emotional pain. As the prison system knows only too well, one of the most effective forms of torture is solitary confinement. It is not hard to see what the evolutionary reasons for social pain might be. Survival among social mammals is greatly enhanced when they are strongly bonded with the rest of the pack. It is the isolated and marginalised animals that are most likely to be picked off by predators, or to starve. Just as physical pain protects us from physical injury, emotional pain protects us from social injury. It drives us to reconnect. But many people find this almost impossible. Itâ€™s unsurprising that social isolation is strongly associated with depression, suicide, anxiety, insomnia, fear and the perception of threat. Itâ€™s more surprising to discover the range of physical illnesses it causes or exacerbates. Dementia, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, lowered resistance to viruses, even accidents are more common among chronically lonely people. Loneliness has a comparable impact on physical health to smoking 15 cigarettes a day: it appears to raise the risk of early death by 26%. This is partly because it enhances production of the stress hormone cortisol, which suppresses the immune system. Studies in both animals and humans suggest a reason for comfort eating: isolation reduces impulse control, leading to obesity. As those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder are the most likely to suffer from loneliness, might this provide one of the explanations for the strong link between low economic status and obesity? Anyone can see that something far more important than most of the issues we fret about has gone wrong. So why are we engaging in this     frenzy of environmental destruction and social dislocation, if all it produces is unbearable pain? Should this question not burn the lips of everyone in public life? There are some wonderful charities doing what they can to fight this tide, some of which I am going to be working with as part of my loneliness project. But for every person they reach, several others are swept past. This does not require a policy response. It requires something much bigger: the reappraisal of an entire worldview. Of all the fantasies human beings entertain, the idea that we can go it alone is the most absurd and perhaps the most dangerous. We stand together or we fall apart.",176,917,"109757981029183488	173205444569993216	222768939497820160	222769798428360706	223151948331888643	352048278449303552	542723237562425344	608369300613824514	608389740660965376",fake

Then you do. Everything is changed utterly. Or about to be, as soon as your new leader is chosen. The country you live in, the parliamentary democracy that ruled it, for good or bad, has been trumped by a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status. From our agriculture to our science and our universities, from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics, and who and what we are in the world  â€”   all is up for a curious, unequal renegotiation with our European neighbours. How did we get to this? What can you do? By now you are putting on your shoes and running through the sequence yet one more time. The Conservative party needed to settle an old dispute within its ranks. The quarrel once wrecked the sleep of John Major. The schism needed to be healed to shore up the position and sleep of David Cameron. Certain newspaper owners and a large minority of Tory backbenchers had to be appeased. The promise to let the people decide was in the Conservative manifesto, and the country had voted for a Conservative government. It was legal and proper to have a referendum. The campaign was conducted by and was an argument between Conservative politicians  â€”   at its simplest,   against  . The role of Ukip was merely to make everyone else seem reasonable. We watched and wondered, as Kremlinologists once did. The Jeremy Corbyn Labour party was shamefully, or shamelessly, absent until it was too late. The status of the 2015 parliamentary act that enabled the referendum was clear, but we didnâ€™t read it. Was it advisory, like some referendums are, or was it binding? The question didnâ€™t come up. We failed to ask it. No use declaring, as you may keep declaring after it didnâ€™t go your way, that all along it was merely advisory. You should have thought of that earlier. And what was the nationâ€™s democratically tendered advice to our lawmakers? That weâ€™re almost evenly split. One third wants to leave, fractionally less than a third wants to stay, and a third doesnâ€™t know or doesnâ€™t care. Seventeen million against 16 million. Each full of contempt for the other. And on this basis and unlike any other country in the world, we are about to redraft our constitution and much else besides. Youâ€™ll be at the coffee before you remember all over again the lies that needed to be told to gain the result. The Â£350m a week that would become available to the NHS that we could halt immigration from Europe and remain in the single market that Turkey was about to join that we could â€œtake back our countryâ€  â€”   as if any international treaty was not, in a   context, a diminution of sovereignty in exchange for a greater good. On your second cup you might check online for the Conservative party rules for selecting a new leader, as if knowing them might empower you somehow. Or you might take another look at the far simpler article 50 that sets out the means of our departure. Barely 400 words, remarkably easy to read, given that it was drawn up by lawyers. When weâ€™ve invoked the clause weâ€™re committed to leave within two years. Our partners donâ€™t want to negotiate with us until the article is invoked. If these were the rules of a card game only a mug would sit down to play. The banker takes all. How can parliament, even assuming it has a say, vote on a deal it cannot see until itâ€™s too late? And yet we are told, even by the defeated Tory remainer faction, that â€œthe people have spokenâ€. Perhaps this is what the party wanted all along  â€”   all of it. We hardly know. The minority of us who read newspapers know less than a tenth of whatâ€™s happening. But we can be sure of the contempt each Tory caucus holds for the others, with some contempt to spare for us bystanders. We may assume that powerful Conservative figures wanted Boris Johnson gone, for historical as well as proximal reasons. Someone lofty may have spoken smoothly into the ear of his lieutenant, Michael Gove, to persuade him he was prime minister material and that he should desert. When he did and Johnson stepped aside, a   grandee, Michael Heseltine, was on hand to disembowel the corpse. Then, for his 15 minutes, Gove was before us,   like foolish Malvolio, until another grandee, Kenneth Clarke, in concert with the Daily Mail, was ready to knife his guts. Two down in the summer of contempt. Or it happened another way. We Kremlinologists can only guess at whatâ€™s being turned over in the clubs of St James or the farmhouses of Oxfordshire. But we do know that what all sides are calling the greatest political crisis of our generation is a creature imagined into being by the Conservative party alone. It, not Ukip, offered the referendum it fought it, it won as well as lost it. For such services, for the mayhem and poison that followed and are clouding the leadership contest, we should now be watching it shredded by an effective, eloquent opposition. But by their silence Corbyn and his troubled, paranoid court have delivered us, in effect, and for the time being, into a   state, and not the Leninist version certain courtiers dream of. Now you watch on helplessly as your prime minister is chosen. It is, of course, constitutionally correct that you have no say in the matter. But itâ€™s hard to shake off that   feeling. We can do no more than gossip round the kitchen table. The butler has a theory, and so does the second chambermaid. Even â€œbootsâ€ knows all about tactical voting. Our   paradoxically measures our distance from events. Is Boris biding his time, or is he truly finished? What does it tell us about the party, post 2008, that Andrea, an   hostile to the minimum wage, could soon be prime minister? Was Theresaâ€™s reticence during the referendum campaign astute and tactical? Or merely an expression of her character? Or is she the remainersâ€™ mole? Can we believe that the chancellor isnâ€™t plotting? We hear footsteps above our head  â€”   more comings and goings. But who? You might cling to the butlerâ€™s mole theory even as you worry that your hopes are loosening your grip on reality: the powerful faction that wanted to remain, and whispered flattery and enticements in Goveâ€™s ear, has cleared the field of Johnson, the other sideâ€™s most powerful contender, and eased one of its own into place as PM. The exit negotiations begin and are inevitably protracted in a game with such stacked odds. Our European friends, watching their own backs, will not be offering kindly terms. Only a fool would want to invoke the dread article too soon. Meanwhile, the economy is in decline, the pound is drifting towards parity with the dollar, the jobless lines are lengthening. Racists and xenophobes are gripped by an elated sense of entitlement. The cry gets louder for a second referendum. The voices come from the only quarter that matters  â€”   the party.   general Dominic Grieve is among the first, then some   then those grandees again. At last, with no loss of face, Prime Minister May reluctantly grants their wish. Itâ€™s what, in her heart, she always wanted. And clearly, the public mood has shifted. On   council estates leavers are suffering what weâ€™ve learned to call buyersâ€™ remorse. Second time around, remain sweeps the board. Weâ€™re back in. In fact, we never left. It was all a bad dream. The summer of contempt will be soon forgotten. Take your shoes off. Go back to bed. When you wake, Boris Johnson will be leader of the Labour party. He was, he says, always well to the left of Tony Blair.

politifact13957,http://proudleader.com/2-liberal-democrat-congressmen-arrested-planning-trumps-assassination/,proudleader.com,"On Thursday, Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, sparking controversy among musicians, novelists and fans. That evening in Los Angeles, his songwriting peer and friend Leonard Cohen gave his thoughts on Dylanâ€™s award. â€œTo me,â€ he said, â€œ[the award] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain. â€ Cohen was speaking at a playback and QA for his forthcoming album, You Want It Darker. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, to the consternation of fans the    had announced: â€œI am ready to die. â€ However, on Thursday evening seemed to have reconsidered his stance.  â€œI think I was exaggerating,â€ Cohen told the audience, according to Billboard. â€œIâ€™ve always been into  . I intend to live forever. â€ At the end of the event, at which Cohen divulged his plans to release another pair of albums after You Want it Darker, the songwriter told the audience: â€œI hope we can do this again. I intend to stick around until 120. â€ Cohen returned to the subject of Dylan when talking about the way he writes songs. â€œI think that Bob Dylan knows this more than all of us: you donâ€™t write the songs anyhow,â€ he said. â€œSo if youâ€™re lucky, you can keep the vehicle healthy and responsive over the years. If youâ€™re lucky, your own intentions have very little to do with this. You can keep the body as   and receptive as possible, but whether youâ€™re actually going to be able to go for the long haul is really not your own choice. â€ His own songs come slowly, he says: â€œIt comes kind of by dribbles and drops. Some people are graced with a flow some people are graced with something less than a flow. Iâ€™m one of those. â€ He added: â€œThe fact that my songs take a long time to write is no guarantee of their excellence. â€ An ordained Zen Buddhist monk who nevertheless still cleaves to Judaism, Cohen has long explored religious themes in his work  â€”   as has Dylan. Nevertheless, Cohen told the audience: â€œIâ€™ve never thought of myself as a religious person. I donâ€™t have any spiritual strategy. I kind of limp along like so many of us do in these realms. Occasionally Iâ€™ve felt the grace of another presence in my life. But I canâ€™t develop any kind of spiritual structure on that. â€ Cohen added: â€œThis biblical landscape is very familiar to me, and itâ€™s natural that I use those landmarks as references. Once they were universal references, and everybody understood and knew them. Thatâ€™s no longer the case today, but it is still my landscape. I try to make those references. I try to make sure theyâ€™re not too obscure. But outside of that, I canâ€™t  â€”   I dare not  â€”   claim anything in the spiritual realm for my own. â€",558,865,"834792605187727361	834798569488052225	834815420569890817	834817772853010438	834819413954043904	834822503184871424	834830784846376960	834831179945766912	834831533110288384	834831671581044736	834831683773886464	834832433631485952	834832440497549312	834832452803653632	834832449347612673	834833620296724482	834834391721451520	834834762632097792	834841696437362688	834842127662215169	834845215575924739	834847044061782016	834849306834300930	834852345242611715	834854913503088641	834856865662111745	834856918111887360	834859526830616578	834859981350510593	834862873025212416	834863637328072704	834863866588839940	834871801658408960	834875705888505856	834875720849633281	834875983677259777	834878626638213121	834883174106873857	834885047694024704	834890257350938625	834893244655882242	834894129318490112	834894198969106432	834906806942060546	834908516519313408	834913256812732416	834917042264358912	834919121171152898	834920614506991616	834920703992414209	834925215025086464	834925233354207234	834927765791068164	834935151310221312	834936339627900929	834946037974511617	834947571885932548	834951162084356096	834952805727223810	834954805961437185	834954988245889025	834955086002536449	834955326248140802	834958972251701248	834961536728719360	834961642081288192	834961650553802752	834961653271691264	834961664013324288	834964241719361537	834965132543471616	834967904915456000	834971521609306113	834979949144465408	834982960877166592	834983418169540609	834992808440233984	834995214108413952	834999762378182656	835006291659603968	835011195845414912	835011277911097344	835012365464793089	835023410270887936	835024399803768833	835035099611672576	835062365406232576	835078150262403072	835079926738997248	835095681228492800	835102143858282496	835103788314865665	835115436077420546	835132895605968900	835142002077483008	835174898511196160	835179829599354880	835186390455500800	835187534338605056	835194155244503041	835253227956367360	835257505173372928	835264970438762497	835267068496785409	835281384491134976	835308837720715266	835308948232126464	835327049342451712	835335471668547584	835353479560445954	835353515740524544	835399142155370497	835437081430224897	835487255775031297	835544775231160322	835580871746990081	835607614650265600	835616138440630272	835622389820063744	835622496313409538	835699941486051328	835740664793006080	835765897230852096	835874240188424193	835876300145459201	835878455367634944	835896737327804416	835898671912845316	835955324146315265	835976556589776896	836046389738110977	836054338653065216	836058488660967425	836059951063789568	836302654976380932	836344170100973568	836345103497179136	836361655588175872	836363862710579200	836368535387451392	836404929879166976	836434496853540865	836440857465225216	836450458474532864	836651117119434755	836742750515019776	836823804953440257	837413081919721477	837550349200175105	837676421237497856	837905130892718080	838222122841427968	838231150594183169	839472964105994240	840386552068993024	840942221650202626	841071798661894146	844070089796145152	844108221954605057	844123883926142976	844208250635534336	844209344715472896	844215477379481600	844266920031543298	845053670148341760	845125230695661572	845227765179842560	845462999728975874	846093660915716097	846519995031060485	852697968016842752	852733454219268096	852821953228308485	852924006940332032	853039928929898497	853126027278725121	853126075492306944	853439502525845504	853443734159097857	859767138390855680	859767178287091712	860591447992676352	864186980531359745	866990997250727936	872286322676957184	874607463412183041	879091771178835968	879092421073809408	879147841863782400	879149264974348288	879185807805997058	879333254767284226	879843867939323905	880007096053501952	880214801695354880	884922609946808320",fake

Paul Verhoevenâ€™s new film, Elle, is an outrageous black comedy, volatile and deadly a film that opens up with a sexual assault and then cleans off the blood ahead of a posh restaurant dinner. â€œI suppose I was raped,â€ Michelle (Isabelle Huppert) casually remarks to her friends, just as the waiter swoops in with a magnum of champagne. A guest at the table flicks a nervous glance at the bottle. He says, â€œMaybe wait a few minutes before popping that. â€ Likewise one perhaps needs to pause before trumpeting Elle as one of the best pictures in this yearâ€™s Cannes competition, if only because its implications are so problematic they require more time to be processed. But thereâ€™s no denying that, in the moment at least, the film is utterly gripping and endlessly disturbing. In carving a hazardous path through hackneyed genre territory, Elle never flags, barely stumbles. Verhoeven, I fear, is pointing his film straight to Hell. He brazenly dares us to stick with him for the ride. Playing the role of Michele Leblanc, a moneyed Paris games executive, Huppert gives a performance of imperious fury, holding the audience at bay, almost goading us to disown her. Audaciously, Elle presents her not so much as a victim but as the casualty of a world she is very much a part of maybe (still more troublingly) an accessory to. Inside her sleek office, Michele strolls disinterestedly past a   model striking a brutalised pose. Her   game allows its user to take the role of a hulking orc rapist, penetrating a damsel from behind with a snaking tentacle. If that werenâ€™t enough, Michele is revealed to be the daughter of Charles Leblanc, a notorious 1970s serial killer, now safely behind bars. There is even a suggestion that she was somehow involved in his crimes. According to Michele, her father was â€œa monsterâ€ in the view of her mother (Judith Magre) he was â€œno more than a manâ€. The filmâ€™s implicit suggestion is that human beings can be both. Perish the thought that Verhoevenâ€™s a safe pair of hands. The director prides himself on discombobulating his audience maybe even discombobulating himself. In his time, the Dutch provocateur has conspired to seduce the Hollywood mainstream with Basic Instinct, flummox it with Starship Troopers and give it a ghastly cold shower with 1995â€™s Showgirls. Elle, however, may just be his most maniacal work to date, a film that runs boldly up and down the tonal bandwidth,   from   horror to devilish satire to light domestic comedy and then back again. For lengthy periods, in fact, Verhoevenâ€™s film appears to forget the rape altogether. Michele clears the broken crockery from the floor, sinks into a bath and then proceeds with her life. She has a demanding job to attend to family problems to address. She is enraged by her milksop son and his bullying pregnant girlfriend. She worries about her vampish mum, who has decided she wants to marry her gigolo. Sheâ€™s having an   affair with her colleagueâ€™s foursquare husband. But all the while the memory of the assault sits quietly in the room, like unstable nitroglycerin beside the  . Time and again, we catch its full horror in the corner of our eye. Michele, for her part, is drawn back to it too. What an electrifying film to close this yearâ€™s Cannes competition. If the delegates imagined they would be sent off with something gentle and affirming, they had another think coming. They sat down in the dark and received a slap in the face, a blatant provocation, a set of jump leads hooked on to their chests. Elle is uproarious, galvanic and guaranteed to spark debate. All at once it as though this yearâ€™s Cannes, a whisker away from the finish line, has just roared back into blazing, angry life.",225,620,"979116675579686912	979116693623640065	979116699642363907	979116713185857541	979590341346189313	979766233435398144	981213877600997377	1004216410988531712",fake

My father was waiting for us. In a nod to the local western culture, he was wearing this strange thing on his head, a cowboy hat, and not recognizing him at first, I began to cry. My father was in Wyoming  â€”   truly the wild west  â€”   on a Fulbright fellowship, and my mother and I joined him several months into his tenure.  He loved cowboy culture: he had watched all the American westerns in Poland. We planned to return there once the fellowship ended. In fact, my parents were so sure of this that they had brought very little with them. Even prized possessions like family photographs and my grandmotherâ€™s handwritten recipe book were left behind.  We ended up staying much longer than expected. The political situation in Poland had changed for the worse in the early 1980s with the rise of nationwide strikes led by the Solidarity movement, a massive opposition movement. There was talk of Soviet intervention. My fatherâ€™s colleagues in Poland began to advise him against returning, as did some local folks in Wyoming.  Wyoming is a small place, and my father was soon introduced to its lone member in the US House of Representatives, a fellow by the name of Dick Cheney. Cheney, a staunch   met my father and encouraged him to defect and stay in the US. Donâ€™t worry, he said, Reagan will soon be president, and we will sort out all the immigration matters. Political asylum would be a slam dunk, he predicted.  We stayed.  The immigration matters, it turns out, were a bit harder to sort out than Cheney predicted. Visas for Fulbright fellowships come with strict requirements to return to oneâ€™s home country for at least two years. Cheney and other prominent people made a valiant effort, but the immigration bureaucracy pushed back.  After several years of being out of status (we had UN refugee passports) we were granted political asylum  â€”   which we received, coincidentally, the same year as Reaganâ€™s 1986 general amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Amnesty: a word that has become politically toxic today among the Republican set, even as a Republican legend was the first to implement it  â€”   helped us to gain legal status once and for all, six years after we decided to stay.  We lived for several years in   Wyoming before moving on to the excitement of California. As one of the few immigrant families in   Wyoming we stuck out like a sore thumb. But everyone wanted to help. A stranger paid our rent. In California, we were among oceans of immigrants just like us, but we were often alone.  When generalized, the immigrant story is clichÃ©. But to each individual immigrant, his or her story is extraordinary. A character in one of Jhumpa Lahiriâ€™s stories, an immigrant to the United States, expresses this best when he observes that he is not the â€œonly man to seek his fortune far from homeâ€ but nevertheless is â€œbewildered by each mileâ€ he has traveled. â€œAs ordinary as it all appears,â€ he says, â€œthere are times when it is beyond my imagination. â€  My father enjoyed a successful career as a chemist in California, and this year was the recipient of a major award from the American Chemical Society for his work. We all attended the award banquet, where many of the honorees were immigrants or former refugees.  Anyone who witnessed this event would be living in a total vacuum if they did not notice the sad irony of the heated     and   rhetoric in our current political campaign juxtaposed with the lasting contributions that a refugee from communist Poland, a Muslim immigrant from Egypt and countless others have made to the United States through chemistry alone.  Just a year ago I would have thought this a clichÃ© not worth repeating, but these days maybe itâ€™s important to repeat often. My brother is a successful manager in a   company. And both my younger sister and I went on to serve the United States as diplomats, and American Fulbright fellows overseas. In a twist of fate, as a US diplomat, I had to deal with cases of Fulbright scholars who wanted an exception to the â€œ â€ rule.  All of this may seem ordinary  â€”   but itâ€™s not, and in many ways it is uniquely possible in the United States. Representative Cheney, the original champion of our immigration case, became   Cheney and a principal supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In another twist of fate, I ended up trying to undo some of the mess that resulted from the war that Mr Cheney had so fervently advocated in my final diplomatic assignment in Iraq. And yet I will always be grateful to him for his role in helping to make the USA my home.",924,11,"802108241899495424	802108287453786112	802108286870831105	802108293980094465	802108292398923777	802108299697012737	802108327878488064	802108330772529152	802108366671622144	802108374087127040	802110425001140224	802112388359024640	802112393237045248	802112403747979264	802112403341131776	802112407829028864	802112412874731520	802112423180148736	802112422358069252	802112421821198337	802112420378353664	802112419602382849	802112427580014592	802112427387076608	802112425528954880	802112423809269761	802112429752602624	802112446269820928	802130492598255616	802146474897375233	802218067417776128	802251778964090880	802462418840469504	802568926047649793	802581076841472000	802606896200892417	802700631760834561	802890543059435520	802898860213465088	802951104912687104	803037496846274561	803084829864710144	803191734612021248	803479636373946368	803774768986001408",fake

These mergers would have consolidated the five national insurers to only three, shaking up the healthcare landscape. At this critical moment for the healthcare system and antitrust policy, regulators made the right call  â€”   and their skepticism should apply to all healthcare mergers. A large body of research finds that consolidation of insurers tends to increase premiums, while competition tends to lower premiums. For instance, in areas where Aetna currently competes with Humana, Aetnaâ€™s premiums are up to $300 lower than in areas where the two companies do not compete. Their merger would not only eliminate this current competition, but also foreclose any future competition between them in other areas and markets. But the healthcare merger frenzy is not just about insurance companies. Indeed, one reason insurers feel the need to merge is to increase their leverage against large hospital systems. Since the   more than 1, 200 hospital mergers have resulted in large hospital systems, which wield their market power to extract excessive prices from insurers. According to a recent analysis of billing data, these prices are the main driver of healthcare costs in commercial markets. Economists estimate that monopoly hospitals charge prices that are 15% higher than prices in more competitive hospital markets. The solution to this problem is not to allow insurers to merge to counteract the market power of hospitals. This tit for tat would fuel an arms race in which corporations would profit at the expense of consumers. Rather, the solution is to enforce a strong presumption against mergers on both sides of the market, starting now. Of course, drug corporations are also in on the game  â€”   accounting for about half of healthcare mergers. Thankfully, the Obama administration recently took action that effectively blocked a proposed merger between Pfizer and Allergan, which would have been the largest healthcare merger ever. But 2015 was still a   year for mergers in the drug industry. These mergers across healthcare sectors tend to drive up healthcare prices and costs for consumers and businesses. But they also have another pernicious effect  â€”   they contribute to rising income inequality. Consider the deal between Aetna and Humana. The CEO of Aetna stands to gain $131m from the merger. Whatâ€™s more, the transaction costs fuel an industry of Wall Street banks and corporate law firms, which have received more than $400m from the four merging insurers. To top it all off, the insurance companies can deduct these expenses from their taxes. More generally, economists are coming around to the view that income inequality among companies explains much of the income inequality among workers. Some companies are increasingly able to enjoy   returns  â€”   a trend that is associated with increasing market consolidation. According to McKinsey,   of   firms with a return of 45% or more from 2010 to 2014 are in the healthcare or information technology sectors. To lower healthcare costs  â€”   and help address income inequality  â€”   policymakers and regulators can take a number of steps. Regulators should review the results of previous mergers on a regular basis. Regulators often approve mergers but require a company to sell its business in certain markets to a competitor. But these remedies, designed to preserve competition, have not worked well in the past. For instance, as a condition of approval of a merger between Humana and Arcadian in 2012, the insurers had to sell 15 plans in certain markets to competitors. Subsequently, premiums increased for nine of these plans by an average of 44%  â€”   that is, until almost all of them exited the market. There should be greater accountability and transparency. Regulators should have public hearings and issue public findings and justifications. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office should appoint an independent Health Consumer Advocate. Companies frequently meet with regulators behind closed doors and inundate them with biased economic studies, but consumers do not have formal input into the process or opportunity to challenge their data. The advocate would monitor trends in prices, quality and utilization in healthcare markets. One purpose would be to shine a spotlight on outliers and identify drivers of cost growth. The advocate would also weigh in with regulators on proposed mergers and could dissent from their decisions. Public programs  â€”   as well as insurers that participate in these programs  â€”   would be required to provide the data necessary to carry out these duties. Above all else, regulators must set a very high bar for mergers. With its decision on the mega health insurance mergers, the Department of Justice has done just that.",512,243,"661382109391691776	661494587119243264	661555829804371968	661557690733301760	661560154429726720	661563077624631299	661565333640212481	661589004190679040	661589951537160192	661592623186972672	661610623285989376	661615797844905985	661618203198517248	661621646835470336	661623043614052352	661666241355063300	661670483402756096	661681702713106432	661687961046618112	661690462265171968	661702299245486080	661710388426178561	661715196386385920	661717459360227328	661720553007386624	661720645361881088	661721668029702144	661723782571270144	661730878054354944	661732600239796224	661747538639372288	661750790638469120	661762671914676224	661765063313780736	661777750995410944	661783727845081090	661792918198476800	661804183293526016	661886603535777792	661888996520275968	661911352236072960	661963905074405376	661970241182810113	662000130611150848	662067216813326336	662614806638137346	662707068902752256	662755009961005056	662800152294477824	663679745696075776	664445715159097344	709102346182250496	794175362972471296	866469825572458496	866510178539028481	866601894361395200	866740382092087296	866782821771345923	866782869930336256	866782949198503938	866782987664470016	866783050855837697	866783444310913024	866783464376467456	866842776310358016	866843964636356608	866867917480222720	866875132676931584	866875137810771969	866875148607004672	866875145125638144	866875162246889473	866875177786785793	866875177174351874	866875184182984705	866876189356457984	866877559505596416	866879762332962817	866890472127684608	866899715660496896	866909602339618816	866914978829279232	867057259200872448	867134433240940546	867183392994975745	867185167802224641	867662765221060608	867907462778822657	868226482543493122	868226862090256384	868227045536518144	868227111194161153	868227156396175360	868227255469842432	868227946812772357	868228473692848132	868228715817439234	868228967421149184	868311108573999108	868648034539896832	868648079360131072	868648104500834305	868648140278292480	868648199694712832	868686283006259200	868847906387877888	868847965582094336	868847992417157121	868848038936236032	868910322417061889	868995839406092289	869383687745544192	869389309295693825	869389337884065792	869506519078928384	869757165422104577	869757238038020096	869757269826613248	869757298431868930	869757357730877441	869757507505242112	869879234793099268	870242758514036736	870258893489807360	870258972724305920	870258996841660416	870337721960505344	870478750139293696	870586346301042688	870677835345649667	870678208538071040	870688302294224896	870870220738404352	870870243341615105	870870278355668992	870870303357812737	870870393858383872	870870418692816896	870870461080412160	871346993926254592	871347040139198464	871347086977101824	871347114583801856	871347156547809280	871347210394378240	871347288941092864	871347325859278848	871347377013104640	871347420076007425	871392978224332801	874243826369667072	874243850763743232	874243878068551680	874243905201504256	874243942585425921	878991843207380992	878991870696853504	958670932909940741",fake
politifact14643,http://dailyfeed.news/san-juan-city-council-votes-unanimously-to-impeach-trump-hating-mayor/,San Juan City Council Votes Unanimously To Impeach Trump-Hating Mayor,"Donald Trump would be the only national leader in the world to dismiss the science of climate change should he become president, putting him out of step even with Syrian president Bashar   Zimbabweâ€™s Robert Mugabe and Kim   the leader of North Korea. The potential isolation of the US on climate change has been laid bare by a new Sierra Club report which found universal acceptance of climate science among the leaders of the 195 countries recognized by the US state department. Close US allies such as Britain, Israel, Canada and France all have heads of government who have voiced their understanding that the world is warming primarily due to human activities.  Even totalitarian or undemocratic leaders accept mainstream climate science, with Assad calling for nations to â€œrespond more effectivelyâ€ to the issue and Kim supporting a   initiative to mitigate greenhouse gases. The Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, has labelled climate change a â€œmajor global challengeâ€. By contrast, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called global warming â€œbullshitâ€ and a â€œhoaxâ€ that was â€œcreated by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitiveâ€. Trump has vowed to remove the US from the Paris climate accord, which was agreed by 195 countries last year in an attempt to curb   carbon dioxide emissions. He has also threatened to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency, which has come under sustained fire from Republicans over its role in Barack Obamaâ€™s   Clean Power Plan.  The Sierra Club report states that it is â€œessential that voters know that Donald Trumpâ€™s position on climate change is just another of his reckless, dangerous positions based more in reality TV than actual realityâ€. The environmental group said Trumpâ€™s stance would leave the US isolated on the world stage and undermine key alliances.  Trumpâ€™s pronouncements on climate change are also contrary to a large proportion of US voters, with recent Gallup polling showing a record number of Americans now see climate change as a threat to their way of life.  Separate research released on Tuesday by Yale University found that 45% of Americans are either â€œalarmedâ€ or â€œconcernedâ€ about climate change, with levels of worry reaching levels not seen since 2008. Trump appears to be speaking for a small but notable minority, with Yale finding that 10% of Americans are â€œdismissiveâ€ of climate change as an issue. Hillary Clinton is likely to assail Trumpâ€™s position on climate change during the presidential campaign, with the expected Democratic nominee handed a new party platform that calls for a carbon price and hefty support for solar and wind energy. In his endorsement of Clinton on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders said the former secretary of state understood the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Sanders said that Trump, on the other hand, â€œchooses to reject science  â€”   something no presidential candidate should do.  â€œHe believes that climate change is a hoax. In fact, he wants to expand the use of fossil fuel. That would be a disaster for our country and our planet. â€",472,77,"918574455269593089	918610593002721283	918610701219979265	918626796798492672	918636817670270976	918642136362504192	918645051906867200	918645347357933568	918645351774535680	918645357797548033	918646518000816129	918657916193800195	918660255319580672	918661888464113664	918666379858980864	918673646398435328	918682150555107328	918683679542583298	918685906860621824	918691678059315200	918691756459225088	918694417166299136	918754407252156416	918780862455599104	918796523198140416	918814301720326144	918826208401526790	918827663610933248	918845506096263168	918846387172679681	918846800886251520	918847125345234944	918847482947182592	918849208731365378	918867585969672192	918867631570001920	918868431478308864	918868629134884864	918868822789992448	918870435462373376	918876571817013248	918877692543619072	918877770708635649	918877977668075526	918879161313300480	918883518486327297	918884970374025216	918893822091948033	918893967349108737	918894198752911361	918894195322040320	918894382274793472	918902008337387520	918903091893886979	918904410381733888	918905087170408449	918905203285311488	918908641318666240	918913730288783362	918915034314665984	918916171373481984	918916639588081664	918920145971634181	918921276034568193	918922627846197248	918924779385524224	918927154242502658	918928029618982914	918930652879294467	918930787940098057	918931410546757632	918935247697440771	918936756363382784	918937826762395649	918949570050060289	918953289277984770	918953600625381376	918971488472051712	918972597240565760	918973557719252992	918973785642029056	918975451728613376	918977726375256064	918981868183277570	918985110225129472	918986288820314112	918989494048538625	919013968525627397	919014958104489984	919016271211098114	919019608845189125	919022939239940098	919025186145427456	919026529673211904	919026708325511169	919034186559668224	919034683752665088	919036075481239552	919036162265747457	919039757706915840	919044315514621953	919044360649543680	919044449367396352	919046754565107714	919049512366301184	919052324898611201	919053769475624960	919055811023986688	919063808328523778	919069652935884800	919073947236347904	919084965496684544	919087860363427840	919090463302336512	919099003496779776	919129578337128448	919146388381868032	919154158946738179	919162080514764800	919164093491220481	919185037014323200	919191716191666176	919191796407783424	919197748187893761	919205559886401537	919208154130472960	919210548356698112	919225843670487040	919229800220327936	919250367958913024	919262182851989506	919262567817768960	919263979116969984	919263984468967425	919265469294612482	919267256659533825	919268456934936576	919284818399043584	919285081792921600	919296798069542912	919345639342968832	919372202289401857	919379225882386432	919419780313915393	919421246034587650	919463860553138177	919467916482953216	919515774317932550	919519781430136832	919543468917080064	919571173955993600	919584109927600130	919625637610041344	919635609504935936	919647838400901120	919683151244300289	919747740141346816	919774950524948480	919874336210784256	919941625337360385	919956912904421376	920125083380862976	920175478920663040	920194152066899973	920194476827729920	920273005321834497	920289486495510528	920330825639583745	920417893799616512	920425360537333761	920443357700263943	920444034476363777	920525497951547393	920661258336129024	923576347917803526	923576406826766337	924325136685248512	924495130178084865	924496010377695232	924512269823873024	924528960129699840	924609545019772928	924815028213071873	924931932911230976	925805269338214400	927325232628682753	927491682270154753	935521665731108864	936758760655216640	1040787607242858496	1040910834413842433	1040936018549981184	1040936367851626496	1041091022044966913	1041115741125332997	1042538087992057857	1043118375990435845	1044386228072841216	1044386823705972737	1053754069301583872	1054007738429329408	1054178085824716800	1054826046921396224",fake

Nearly 15% of the Earthâ€™s land, covering around 20m sq km, is contained in national parks or other protected areas. This figure has flatlined over the past year, largely because of improved data collection, but is close to an internationally agreed goal to protect 17% of the land surface by 2020. There has been a faster rate of progress in ocean conservation, albeit of a low base. Around 4% of the total surface of the ocean, covering 15m sq km, is now protected. This area, roughly the size of Russia, has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But the progress report by the UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warns that some of the most biodiverse ecosystems are not being protected and that the management of many protected areas is deficient.  Less than 20% of areas considered crucial hubs for species are fully protected, the report states, with countries routinely failing to assess the effectiveness of their national parks nor provide wildlife corridors that allow animals to roam between protected areas. Restricting hunting, mining and other development helps speciesâ€™ overall survival chances, with the report stating that global populations of terrestrial species in protected areas suffered an average decline of 18% from 1970 to 2010, compared to a 39% loss for species when unprotected areas are included. â€œEcological factors such as park size, fragmentation and connectivity are fundamentally important in the long term, but are often superseded by   social and economic factors,â€ the report, presented at the IUCN congress in Hawaii, found. â€œProtected areas can have positive impacts on species extinction risk and population trends, but they need to be properly sited and managed to realize their full potential. â€  Erik Solheim, head of UN environment, said that â€œhuge gainsâ€ have been made in the quantity of protected areas, but this had to be matched by their quality.  â€œThe world needs to do more to effectively protect our most biologically diverse spaces,â€ he said. â€œProtected areas need to be better connected, to allow populations of animals and plants to mix and spread. Also important is ensuring local communities are involved in protection efforts. Their support is fundamental to   conservation. â€  Countries in South America and the Caribbean protect the largest portion of their land, with Brazil accounting for the worldâ€™s largest safeguarded system, spanning 2. 47m sq km. Countries in the Middle East, by contrast, protect just 119, 000 sq km, or around 3% of the areaâ€™s landmass.  Some nations are moving towards including biodiversity values in their national accounts, such as the UK, which has accounted for the value of air quality and recreation in areas such as the Lake District. But other nations continue to subsidize ecologically harmful practices, such as Thailandâ€™s support for a shrimp farming industry that is resulting in the destruction of mangroves.  Marine reserves have grown thanks to new measures taken by countries including Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Spain. The report does not include the recent creation of the worldâ€™s largest ocean reserve by the US, off the   islands of Hawaii.  Conservationists are pushing for far greater efforts to protect marine life, with a resolution put to the IUCN congress that nations aim for 30% of the oceans to be protected. While terrestrial ecosystems are affected by climate change, poaching and mass land conversion for agriculture, the warming, acidifying oceans are possibly faring even worse with less protected area.   Dan Laffoley, a marine adviser for the IUCN, said the 30% target is â€œimportant, absolutely critical, but we need to think beyond those targets. We need to protect much more of the ocean, only about 1% is strictly protected.   â€œWith the knowledge we have, we need more than that.

The   document released by the Republicans on the House select committee on Benghazi brought to a close a fiercely partisan,   $7m investigation that included interviews with more than 80 witnesses. The report reveals new details about the night of the attack and concludes that the Obama administration failed to recognize the possibility of it happening. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, his state department colleague Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed when Islamist militants stormed the US consulate in Benghazi on 11 September 2012. Controversy has raged ever since over the chain of events and how much support the men had from Washington. The White House noted tersely that this was the eighth congressional committee to investigate the attacks and went on longer than the   commission and the committees designated to look at Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President John F Kennedy, the   affair and Watergate. It accused Republicans of pursuing â€œwild conspiracy theoriesâ€. Committee chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina, denied that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Clinton was the target. â€œWhen the select committee was formed, I promised to conduct this investigation in a manner worthy of the American peopleâ€™s respect, and worthy of the memory of those who died,â€ he said. â€œThat is exactly what my colleagues and I have done. Now, I simply ask the American people to read this report for themselves, look at the evidence we have collected, and reach their own conclusions. â€ But a split emerged among Republicans on the committee. Two members, Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, issued a   supplementary report more forthright in its criticism. It says: â€œWhat we did find was a tragic failure of leadership  â€”   in the   to the attack and the night of  â€”   and an administration that, so blinded by politics and its desire to win an election, disregarded a basic duty of government: tell the people the truth. And for those reasons Benghazi is, and always will be, an American tragedy. â€ Jordan, from Ohio, and Pompeo, from Kansas, were equally blunt in their condemnation of Clinton in particular. â€œSecretary Clinton and the administration told one story privately  â€”   that Benghazi was a terrorist attack  â€”   and told another story publicly  â€”   blaming a   protest,â€ they wrote. Pressed on whether he believed that Clinton lied, Gowdy declined to give a direct answer, telling journalists to read the report. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to decide that for yourself,â€ he said. The committeeâ€™s Democrats, who have long derided the investigation as politically motivated, on Monday released their own report on the committeeâ€™s findings. â€œAlthough the select committee obtained additional details that provide context and granularity, these details do not fundamentally alter the previous conclusions,â€ the Democratsâ€™ report said. Donald Trump has used the incident to discredit Clintonâ€™s time at the helm of the state department. In a speech last week, he said Clinton â€œspread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims was our late ambassador Chris Stevensâ€. And on Tuesday Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, weighed in: â€œThe new information in the majorityâ€™s report on the Benghazi terrorist attack makes clear that Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration engaged in a politically motivated   weeks before the 2012 presidential election. â€œHillary Clinton knew the night of the attack it had nothing to do with an internet video, and yet she shamefully peddled this false narrative to the American public and to the victimsâ€™ families. This in itself is a disqualifying act of deception. â€ Clinton, campaigning in Denver, said: â€œI understand that after more than two years and $7m spent by the Benghazi committee under taxpayer funds, it had to today report that it had found nothing  â€”   nothing  â€”   to contradict the conclusions that the independent accountability board, or the conclusions of the prior multiple earlier investigations carried out on a bipartisan basis in the Congress. â€ She added: â€œSo while this unfortunately took on a partisan tinge, I want us to stay focused on what Iâ€™ve always wanted us to stay focused on, and that is the important work of diplomacy and development. â€ The Democratic nominee added: â€œThatâ€™s especially true in dangerous places. We cannot withdraw or retreat from the world. America needs a presence for a lot of reasons, and the best way to honor the commitment and sacrifice of those weâ€™ve lost is to redouble our efforts to provide resources and support that our diplomats and development groups deserve. So, Iâ€™ll leave it to others to characterize this report, but I think itâ€™s pretty clear that itâ€™s time to move on. â€ In Washington, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, condemned the report claiming it dealt in â€œpolitically motivated fantasiesâ€ and accused Republicans of â€œcynically trying to capitalise on the deaths of four innocent Americans who were killed overseasâ€.  Asked if he believed this finally drew a line under the Benghazi issue, Earnest replied: â€œI thought it was over after the first five investigations. This was the eighth. â€ He called on the Republican National Committee to correctly report the   contributions for the $7m investigation in its next filing with the Federal Election Commission. In October, Clinton endured 11 hours of questioning by the House select committee, and was roundly commended for her performance during the marathon hearing while the chairman was criticized for failing to produce any new information about the 2012 attack. The hearing was a turning point for Clintonâ€™s campaign. On the trail, Democrats still refer to her    performance as a testament to her endurance and ability to withstand and overcome partisan attacks. The report faults the military for its slow response sending resources to the Libyan city during the deadly 2012 attacks on a US outpost, despite clear orders from Barack Obama and the then US defense secretary Leon Panetta. Gowdy said â€œnothing was en route to Libya at the time the last two Americans were killed almost eight hours after the attacks beganâ€. He said the Libyan forces that evacuated Americans from the CIA annex in Benghazi were not affiliated with any of the militias the CIA or state department had developed a relationship with during the previous 18 months. Gowdy said on Tuesday that the report documents that the US was slow to send help to the Americans in Benghazi â€œbecause of an obsession with hurting the Libyansâ€™ feelingsâ€. He said the report was not aimed at Clinton, but portrays â€œseries of heroic actsâ€ by Americans under attack â€œand what we can do to preventâ€ other assaults. The Democratsâ€™ report released on Monday saying that while the state departmentâ€™s security measures in Benghazi the night of 11 September 2012 were â€œwoefully inadequateâ€ Clinton never personally turned down a request for additional security. Democrats said the military could not have done anything differently that night to save the lives of the Americans. On Tuesday, the panelâ€™s Democrats denounced the Republicansâ€™ report as â€œa conspiracy theory on steroids  â€”   bringing back   allegations with no credible evidence whatsoeverâ€.  The state department also issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that the â€œessential factsâ€ of the attacks â€œhave been known for some timeâ€ and have been the subject of numerous reviews, including one by an independent review board.

politifact13816,http://theseattletribune.com/trumps-unsecured-android-device-believed-to-be-source-of-recent-white-house-leaks/,Information for the Nation,"A Belgium international belatedly illuminated Anfield, though it was not Christian Benteke with the   equaliser that preserved Liverpoolâ€™s unbeaten home run. Eden Hazard rolled back the months with a display reminiscent of his role in Chelseaâ€™s title victory last season but it is his country, not his club, that stands to benefit from his return to fitness and form. Chelseaâ€™s away support chanted for a new contract for John Terry and unveiled a banner showing the trophies won under his stewardship complete with a call to â€œsign him upâ€. Yet the performance of their mesmerising No10 showed there are other, younger assets that Stamford Bridge can   to lose this summer. Hazard capped a fine evening with an outstanding individual goal, only his fourth in the Premier League this season, and his recovery comes just in time for Belgiumâ€™s Euro 2016 campaign. But Guus Hiddinkâ€™s team paid the price for failing to kill the contest in the second half. â€œHe had a difficult year,â€ Hiddink, Chelseaâ€™s interim manager, said of the Belgian. â€œHe was one of the best last year and this year he was falling into injury, coming back nearly, falling back into injury and that made him vulnerable physically. You get frustrated. The last few weeks he has been working on a programme to be fully fit and now steadily he has got his shape and then you can see what he is able to do. He has a lot of talent, is clever and can play   . He is conceding a lot of physical contacts but he goes on and it is nice to see. He is physically and mentally fit and it is a pleasure to see those sort of players. â€ For JÃ¼rgen Klopp, there was an element of fortune in Liverpoolâ€™s unbeaten run at Anfield reaching game No13. A ninth Premier League defeat beckoned in the managerâ€™s 50th match in charge until the Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was deceived by Sheyi Ojoâ€™s cross and pushed the ball on to the head of the waiting Benteke. The combination of the two Liverpool substitutes for the equaliser reflected well on the teamâ€™s attitude and the managerâ€™s decision to go for broke, but Klopp will need much more from what appeared his Europa League final side when it reconvenes against Sevilla next week. Klopp said: â€œFor the first 15 minutes we played wonderful football without scoring and I said after the game it was the most important game of the season. We showed in the first 15 minutes what we were capable of. There was not enough faith in our own quality and so we lost patience and when you lose patience it is always difficult and we lost formation. â€œWe didnâ€™t defend together but we invested a lot and that made us tired. That was the problem of the game. Maybe they could have scored the second one but Simon Mignolet did brilliantly and Kolo [TourÃ©] and Dejan [Lovren] saved our life at this moment. We had two or three really good moments and we used one to get a draw. The last 10 minutes it was not too lucky but we could have lost today. â€ Hazard opened the scoring with a quite exquisite goal. There was minimal threat to the home defence when the playmaker collected possession deep in the Liverpool half and even after exchanging passes with Cesc FÃ bregas. But then he accelerated past four weak challenges with a deft touch and a drop of the shoulder and, from the edge of the penalty area, swept an outstanding finish into the far corner of Mignoletâ€™s goal. It served as a reminder of the form and talent that brought Hazard player of the year awards last season and has been sorely missed at Stamford Bridge for the majority of this campaign. Bertrand TraorÃ©, the youngster Tammy Abraham and Hazard all had chances to secure the away win but, with Mignolet saving well and opportunities wasted, Liverpool always had hope of a reprieve.

Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore's Yearbook 'Signature' (VIDEO),"Lights flashing, three police cars showed up to Bill  â€™s quiet suburban street on the morning of 15 December 2015. The Benicia, California, man had stayed up all night waiting for the sheriffâ€™s office to evict him from the house his grandparents had owned since 1971. â€œIt was really, really traumatic,â€   recalled one year later. Standing outside the locked front door, the    peered into the empty living room that holds his earliest Christmas memories and surveyed the overgrown ivy damaging the houseâ€™s facade. The foreclosure  â€”   which he said was based on a predatory loan and improper paperwork  â€”   originated with lender OneWest Bank, at the time run by chairman and CEO Steven Mnuchin. The veteran Wall Street financierâ€™s foreclosure practices are receiving fresh scrutiny this week after   Donald Trump announced him as the nominee for US Treasury secretary. â€œRather than shaking up Wall Street, he installs the very person that was part of the financial mess,â€ said   who has effectively been homeless since the foreclosure. â€œIâ€™m just thoroughly disgusted. â€ Mnuchin, who is also a Hollywood movie producer, earned the nickname â€œforeclosure kingâ€ after he purchased distressed mortgages during the financial crisis and evicted thousands of homeowners. The former Goldman Sachs banker, worth an estimated $40m, has no government experience, and critics worry that, as Treasury secretary, his policies could benefit the wealthiest people and roll back critical bank regulations. One controversial source of OneWest foreclosures is the corporationâ€™s reverse mortgages, which are loans to elderly homeowners that enable them to borrow against their home equity. These types of mortgages have been aggressively marketed to seniors as a way to help them stay in their homes, but some donâ€™t understand the risks and canâ€™t afford associated fees. In 2006,  â€™s grandparents bought a reverse mortgage from IndyMac Bank, the predecessor to OneWest, which he said took advantage of his grandfather, who suffered from dementia.  After his grandparents died in 2012,   moved in, but the corporation  â€”   by then OneWest and run by Mnuchin  â€”   quickly began foreclosure proceedings.  The bankâ€™s case, he said, relied on a document signed with the name â€œBryan Blyâ€ who has been widely reported in numerous investigations as a   â€œ â€.   are individuals whose signatures are wrongfully used to automatically authenticate thousands of mortgage documents that they havenâ€™t read and are in some cases falsely notarized.  The document, which an auditor determined was improper, makes his foreclosure illegitimate,   said, adding: â€œItâ€™s elder financial abuse. â€ His family is still fighting the foreclosure, but in the meantime  â€™s mother has been forced to live in a nursing home. The California Reinvestment Coalition, a   that has scrutinized OneWest, found through public records requests that the bank disproportionately foreclosed on seniors. The firm was allegedly responsible for 39% of reverse mortgages in recent years even though it only has 17% of the market.  From 2009 to 2015, the bank was responsible for more than 36, 000 total foreclosures in California, according to the coalition.  Julie Cheney, a California resident whose parents lost their home to a OneWest foreclosure stemming from a reverse mortgage, testified against OneWest before it merged with a company called CIT Group last year. (Mnuchin earned millions from the sale).  â€œItâ€™s so wrong,â€ Cheney said, explaining that the bank sold her parents a mortgage they didnâ€™t need while her father was dying of cancer and on pain medication and her mother was suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s disease.  Her familyâ€™s unsuccessful court battle against OneWest was a huge strain on her mother right before she died, Cheney added. â€œIt was the worst time of my life. â€  Maeve Elise Brown, executive director of Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, said some of the cruelest OneWest evictions she has observed involve foreclosures against recently widowed homeowners. â€œItâ€™s unimaginable. People are still traumatized from the death of their loved one,â€ she said, â€œand then they are faced with the second largest loss, which is the roof over their head. â€  CIT Group and Trumpâ€™s transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Foreclosures arenâ€™t the only way OneWest has inflicted harm on vulnerable people, according to critics.  In November, two   filed a complaint against the bank, alleging that it has violated the Fair Housing Act by failing to locate branches in communities of color and providing disproportionately low rates of loans to Asian Americans, African Americans and Latinos in California.  In   neighborhoods, OneWest was far more likely to foreclose on homes than make loans available, according to the charges, which claim that in 2014 and 2015, the corporation offered only two loans to black borrowers.  The complaint, which calls for an investigation by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, further accuses the corporation of allowing foreclosed properties to become blighted and abandoned in communities of color, while properly maintaining and marketing homes in white neighborhoods.  â€œThere is a very high price to pay in terms of the health and safety of the neighborhood,â€ said Caroline Peattie, executive director of the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California, which filed the complaint alongside the reinvestment coalition.  In white neighborhoods, OneWest properties generally had â€œmanicured lawns, securely locked doors and windows, and attractive, professional, â€˜for saleâ€™ signs posted out frontâ€ according to the complaint. In communities of color, the foreclosed houses â€œwere more likely to have trash strewn about the premises, overgrown grass, shrubbery, and weeds, and boarded or broken doors and windowsâ€. Blighted properties can attract garbage, crime and public safety hazards, she said, adding that studies have found that living near foreclosures is linked to higher blood pressure.  â€œItâ€™s as if a

Federal courts struck down restrictive voting laws in Kansas and Wisconsin. And in a particularly important decision, the fourth circuit court of appeals delivered a stinging rebuke to North Carolinaâ€™s egregious vote suppression law. As the court observed, North Carolina legislators didnâ€™t even try to hide the core purpose of the law: to stop African Americans from getting to the polls. The politics of North Carolina are a perfect illustration of what led the Republican party to nominate Trump. The southern state, which has seen a large influx of people into its prosperous urban centers, is becoming more liberal  â€”   Barack Obama carried the state in 2008, and Mitt Romney carried it by only two points in 2012. North Carolina Republicans have not reacted to these trends, however, by becoming more moderate.  The clash between a Republican party running at full speed to the right while its population was trending to the left led North Carolina to pass a particularly terrible   law. In 2013, a bare majority of the US supreme court gave the green light to North Carolina by striking down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states, such as North Carolina, that had a history of discrimination to preclear electoral law changes with the Department of Justice. In addition to a requirement that voters show particular forms of ID, the state eliminated Sunday voting, narrowed the window for early voting and eliminated   vote registration and early registration for   and   olds. Voter ID requirements at least have the superficial appearance of addressing the integrity of elections, although in practice the justification is bogus. But most of the provisions in North Carolinaâ€™s attack on the right to vote had no purpose, even in theory, other than to make it harder for people to vote. Or, to put it more accurately, make it harder for some people to vote. In a careful, detailed, and absolutely devastating opinion for a unanimous   panel, Judge Diana Motz demonstrated that the law â€œtarget[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precisionâ€. The discriminatory intent that could be clearly inferred from the nature of the statute itself was not well hidden.  As Motz pointed out: â€œ[B]efore enacting that law, the legislature requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans. â€ When you request data about how changes in vote laws will affect the African American vote, and then change laws in ways deliberately designed to suppress it, thereâ€™s really no room left for doubt.  The story in Wisconsin is similar, although its legislature was a little better at hiding its tracks. Republicans in the state have used lower   turnouts to win elections and pursue a very aggressive conservative agenda in a state that perennially votes Democratic in presidential elections. It passed vote restrictions that disproportionately affect people of color and the poor, and these restrictions were also struck down on Friday. Both of these decisions materially affect the elections in November. Not only will Trump be targeting North Carolina and Wisconsin both states have Senate elections, with control of the chamber responsible for confirming (or not confirming) supreme court nominees looking to come down to the wire. The nakedness of these vote suppression tactics is so obvious that earlier in July, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals struck down similar legislation in Texas. While the supreme court made it harder to challenge these tactics by gutting the voting rights law, there are still remedies available and federal courts have finally begun to push back against these attempts to suppress the votes of people of color and the poor. These are important victories. But they also underscore the importance of getting a supreme court majority that will fight back against vote suppression rather than facilitating it. Whether this happens will be determined in November, not only in the contest between Clinton and Trump but in the contest to control the Senate.

With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, the scientists observed Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. â€œIf plumes exist, this is an exciting find,â€ lead researcher William Sparks said. â€œIt means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals,â€ he added. â€œIt would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. â€ The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. â€œWe presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because thatâ€™s what Europaâ€™s made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed. â€ With other instruments, he said, the scientists could search for hydrogen, oxygen and other chemicals that could hint to what the ocean is made up of.  Europa is one of the most active bodies in the solar system: about the size of Earthâ€™s moon, and at its warmest only about   ( ) and covered in an icy shell that makes one of the most reflective objects in the neighborhood. But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating  â€”   the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant. Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. â€œFor a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth,â€ Nasa astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. â€œWeâ€™re lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically. â€œWe have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics. Europa might be such a place. â€ The finding, Nasaâ€™s astrophysicist Paul Hertz said, â€œincreases our confidence that water and other materials in Europaâ€™s ocean, Europaâ€™s hidden ocean, might be . .. available for us to study without us landing and digging on those unknown miles of iceâ€. Scientists have collected clues for decades of an ocean beneath Europaâ€™s icy shell. In 1979, Voyager spacecraft showed that the ice was cracked in some places, like ice floes on Earth, and the 1990s Galileo mission, which spent eight years orbiting Jupiter, confirmed the ocean under Europa. A 2016 study suggested that Europa produces 10 times more oxygen than hydrogen, and a 2014 study suggested the moon may have plate tectonics, qualities that would make it like Earth. Nasa scientists have been working on proposals for a Europa mission for 15 years, and has a tentative plan to send a spacecraft on a flyby near the moon in the 2020s, zipping past its intense,   radiation field. The ESA has also planned a mission to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) which will aim to orbit the moon Ganymede and collect data and Europa and a third moon, Callisto. â€œThe Europa flyby is not a   mission,â€ said program scientist Curt Niebur. â€œThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa. â€  Niebur said that Nasa was well versed in evaluating habitability, but had little in its history evaluating for life. â€œWhen it comes to finding life we donâ€™t have as much experience, and we have an ongoing and vigorous debate in the scientific community when it goes to finding out. â€ Sparks and Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman similarly downplayed the chances that a flyby mission could find direct evidence of life. â€œBy the time it gets into space, with radiation and cryogenic temperature, itâ€™s not going to survive,â€ he said. â€œThe juryâ€™s out,â€ said Wiseman. â€œIt first depends on whether the plumes are really there. â€ Should the plumes exist, a spacecraft orbiting Europa could collect samples from plumes to get a taste of what Hertz called â€œa global saline liquid water oceanâ€ that â€œengulfs the moon at the present time, hidden under miles of iceâ€. Last year Nasaâ€™s Cassini spacecraft dove into the plumes erupting from Saturnâ€™s moon Enceladus, finding ice and dust that revealed qualities of the moonâ€™s ocean. â€œIt has revealed a tremendous amount of information about the ocean that is present beneath Enceladusâ€™ ice shell,â€ Hertz said. â€œWe would kill to have that kind of information and data about Europa. â€ Sparks said the observations announced today were actually made in 2014, only a year after Nasa researchers saw what they believed to be evidence of water vapor plumes shooting 120 miles into space from Europaâ€™s south pole. â€œItâ€™s not just taking a picture,â€ Sparks said. â€œItâ€™s a rather complicated way of observing. â€ He said that engineers had to develop the software to analyze a table of observed events, about 50 miles in total, and that the researchers continued to observe the moon throughout. Sparks said that they had found statistically significant results, but cautioned: â€œWe do not claim to have proven the existence of plumes but rather to have contributed evidence that such activity may be present. â€",472,552,,fake

Authorities named the woman killed and revealed that train engineer Thomas Grayling has answered investigatorsâ€™ questions and was cooperating, after being released from hospital following the crash at a major transportation hub in Hoboken during Thursday morningâ€™s rush hour. But the cause of the crash, and whether it could have been prevented by safety devices, remains unclear.  Rail investigators have pulled one of the trainâ€™s black box data recorders from the wreckage and on Friday were struggling to extract the second one intact from a   camera on the front of the train, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported. The two recorders are expected to contain information on speed, braking and other conditions that will help experts piece together the operation of the equipment and the actions of the engineer immediately before the New Jersey Transit commuter train crashed. Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, the woman who died in the crash, was not a passenger on the train but was killed by falling debris. She was a    mother of one daughter described as having a â€œbig and genuine heart, â€œI am speechless and feel like the world stopped for some moments,â€ Cecilia Marques, a former   at a company that specialized in travel to Brazil, told the Associated Press. â€œI had the privilege to get to know and work with Fabiola for some years, and I can say she was a great, talentedâ€ woman. De Kroon previously worked in the Brazilian legal department of SAP, a technology firm, the company said in a statement. She had just dropped her toddler daughter off at daycare before rushing to catch a train, according to daycare director Karlos Magner. â€œWe had a good talk for like a minute,â€ he said. â€œShe said she was in a rush. â€ A bystander, Rahman Perkins, tried to help De Kroon but could only comfort her as she lay trapped by metal debris that had fallen from the partially collapsed ceiling. â€œI just told her to fight for your breath, think about your family, think about your friends, think about tomorrow,â€ Perkins said. â€œI just wanted her to feel special and just donâ€™t think about the pain, donâ€™t think about whatever this chaos is, donâ€™t worry about it, youâ€™ll be fine. â€ Perkins said he tried to hug the woman as she died. â€œI saw that beauty in her. I saw that peace,â€ he said. â€œI want [de Kroonâ€™s family] to know she was that same person, she wasnâ€™t mangled, she wasnâ€™t all over the place, she was just there and unfortunately she didnâ€™t make it. â€ Engineer Gallagher, a   veteran of New Jersey Transit, was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon. Fifteen of the injured were still in the hospital, including two in intensive care. Meanwhile, early on Friday morning commuters faced a confusing and dark journey into New York City. Reporters on the scene captured images of a lightless and signless transit hub, where commuters had to navigate an unfamiliar station to reach a ferry to New York. Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York avoided commenting on Thursday on whether positive train control, a safety device widely used in Europe and ordered by the federal government, could have prevented the crash. The speed limit heading into the station is 10mph. â€œThe train came in at much too high rate of speed, and the question is: why is that?â€ Christie said. More answers were expected from a National Transportation Safety Board investigation, including from event recorders recovered from the accident,   Bella   said on Friday morning.. The implementation of positive train control has been delayed in New York and New Jersey, despite repeated deadly crashes in the area, including in the Bronx and in Valhalla, New York, on a Metro North train and near Philadelphia on an Amtrak train.  The crash has also put a renewed focus on New Jersey Transit, an organization some critics say has been â€œsystematically starvedâ€ by Christieâ€™s cuts and a lack of state transportation funds. Despite   recent exceptions, rail continues to be one of the safest ways for passengers to travel in the US. Each year, roughly seven passengers on mainline trains are killed, according to recent research. Cuomo and Christie both cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the role that the lack of positive train control played or did not play in the tragedy. The NTSB has been pressing for some version of the technology for at least 40 years and the industry is under government orders to install it, but regulators have repeatedly extended the deadline at railroadsâ€™ request. The target date is now the end of 2018. Over the past 20 years, the NTSB has listed the lack of positive train control as a contributing factor in 25 crashes. Those include an Amtrak crash last year in Philadelphia in which a speeding train ran off the rails along a curve. Eight people were killed. In 2011, a Port Authority   or Path commuter train crash in a separate section of the Hoboken station injured more than 30 people. The NTSB found the engineer failed to control the speed of the train as it entered the station and investigators also determined a contributing factor was the absence of positive train control. â€œTheyâ€™ll have to answer for themselves, but at the end of the day if safety is job one   â€¦     then you have to have a better record than New Jersey Transit has right now,â€ said New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, noting that the transit agency said in a 2016 Federal Railroad Administration report that it did not have positive train control on any locomotive or segment of track. â€œThat

Icihiro broke Pete Roseâ€™s   record of 4, 256 after a double during the Miami Marlinsâ€™ game against the San Diego Padres, but Rose said he wasnâ€™t counting Ichiroâ€™s hits in Japan. The Miami Marlins outfielder has a career total of 4, 257 hits  â€”   2, 979 in MLB and 1, 278 in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. Rose, who won three World Series rings, told USA Today earlier this week: â€œIt sounds like in Japan theyâ€™re trying to make me the Hit Queen. Iâ€™m not trying to take anything away from Ichiro  â€”   heâ€™s had a Hall of Fame career  â€”   but the next thing you know, theyâ€™ll be counting his high school hits. â€œI donâ€™t think youâ€™re going to find anybody with credibility say that Japanese baseball is equivalent to   baseball. There are too many guys that fail here, and then become household names there, like Tuffy Rhodes. How can he not do anything here, and hit (a  ) 55 home runs (in 2001) over there? â€œIt has something to do with the caliber of personnel. â€ Ichiroâ€™s pursuit of the milestone is big news in Japan. NHK, Japanâ€™s national public broadcasting network, is broadcasting every game to chronicle one of the greatest achievements in Japanese sports history. But in the US, itâ€™s drawn little fanfare  â€”   something that doesnâ€™t sit well with some. â€œI cannot believe itâ€™s not a bigger deal in Major League Baseball. Shame on us for not making a bigger deal out of it,â€ Arizona Diamondbacks assistant hitting coach Mark Grace told USA Today. â€œYouâ€™re talking about breaking Pete Roseâ€™s record. I couldnâ€™t care less if he got some of those hits in Japan or in Antarctica. Youâ€™re getting hits at high professional levels. Thatâ€™s huge. Iâ€™m in awe of the guy. â€ Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who produced 2, 153 career hits, said: â€œItâ€™s hard to compare, but itâ€™s a lot of hits no matter how you slice it. Weâ€™ve had a number of Japanese players come over and be really successful. To say itâ€™s   and   numbers, thatâ€™s not quite fair. â€œThe fact is that heâ€™s going to have 3, 000 hits here, and to have all of those hits in Japan, too, tells you how special he is. The hits over there are hits against good quality pitching, basically major   players, so theyâ€™re legitimate for sure. â€",175,662,"917522953390223366	917849762417831936	917872237222428673	918082761990303745	918510122363744257",fake

At the IOCâ€™s session before the Rio Olympic Games, the president intensified his attack on Wada, saying it was to blame for the chaos because it did not act sooner to investigate claims of Russian doping. Asked for a show of hands in support of the IOCâ€™s stance, 84 of the 85 members raised their hand. Only Britainâ€™s Adam Pengilly voted against Bachâ€™s position. More than 200 Russian athletes are in Rio in limbo having been put forward to compete by their federations but awaiting ratification by a   IOC panel at some point before the opening ceremony on Friday. Most of the sports put forward the majority of the Russian athletes who had been nominated, with only athletics, rowing, weightlifting and canoeing taking a more robust stance. on Wednesday the court of arbitration for sport threw out the appeal filed by 17 Russian rowers against their exclusion from the Games. The IOC has been roundly criticised for its confusing response to the McLaren report that was commissioned by Wada and which revealed systemic widespread doping in Russia across the majority of Olympic sports. Bach again blamed Wada for failing to act sooner on evidence of   doping in Russia and releasing its findings so close to the start of the Games. He said it would be wrong to make individual Russian athletes â€œcollateral damageâ€ for the wrongdoing of their government. â€œLeaving aside that such a comparison is completely out of any proportion when it comes to the rules of sport, let us just for a moment consider the consequences of a â€˜nuclear optionâ€™,â€ Bach said. â€œThe result is death and devastation. This is not what the Olympic movement stands for. The cynical â€˜collateral damageâ€™ approach is not what the Olympic movement stands for. What is therefore not acceptable is the insinuation by some proponents of this nuclear option, that anyone who does not share their opinion is not fighting against doping. â€ Bach has become increasingly emboldened in his stance since arriving in Rio, arguing in his opening press conference the IOCâ€™s reputation had not been damaged by the affair. Bach, whose links to Vladimir Putin have also come under scrutiny, went further in front of the IOC members as he renewed his attack on Wada. â€œIt is not the IOC that is responsible for the accreditation and supervision of   laboratories,â€ he said. â€œThe IOC has no authority over the testing programme of athletes outside the Olympic Games. The IOC has no authority to follow up on information about the failings of the testing system. â€ The IOC has convened a meeting later this year to discuss the future of   with the future of Wada  â€”     funded by the IOC and governments  â€”   in the balance. Many argue it would be a retrograde step to give the IOC more control over  . Sir Craig Reedie, who is an IOC   but also the president of Wada, admitted that the   system was partly broken but denied he had been â€œrun under a busâ€ by Bach and the IOC. â€œI would like to think not all the system is broken, that part of the system is broken, and we should start to identify those parts that need full attention,â€ he said. Earlier, the Argentinean IOC member Dr Gerardo Werthein had accused Wada of being â€œmore interested in   and publicityâ€. Reedie responded: â€œI told him that I found that personally offensive. He assured me that he wasnâ€™t speaking about me. â€ Reedie has repeatedly called in recent months for more money to fund   suggesting in an article for the Guardian that sponsors and rights holders should divert some of their cash into dramatically increasing its $27m a year budget, currently provided jointly by the IOC and national governments. â€œI have to find out the additional things people want me to do. I can tell you that we have a limited number of people employed around the world and every year, we are asked to do more and more and more with effectively the same level of funding,â€ said Reedie. â€œIâ€™ve been running the hare that perhaps broadcasters, sponsors that invest in and benefit very largely from the world of sport, might just think clean sport was a good idea and would like to help. â€ The strongest criticism came from the Canadian member Dick Pound, the founding Wada president who has been outspoken in calling for a complete ban on Russia and oversaw the original investigation that led to an outright ban of all but one Russian track and field athlete. â€œWe need to do a lot more to show we really do care about fair play, honest competition and clean athletes,â€ he said. By the end, however, Pound was among the 84 members who voted in favour. â€œThe arrowâ€™s left the bow,â€ he said. â€œThe decision has been made, itâ€™s not going to be changed between now and the start of the Games. â€ The world swimming governing body Fina moved to clarify the position of two swimmers, Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev, who were named in McLarenâ€™s report but have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport against their ban. â€œContrary to recent media reports, the eligibility of Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev to compete at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 has not been confirmed, and will not be confirmed until the IOCâ€™s   commission to review Russian entrants renders its final decision on these athletes, along with the other members of the Russian swimming team,â€ Fina said, â€œThe two athletes filled an appeal to Cas and Fina understands that this court has forwarded the case to the IOC   commission for final decision. â€ Cas is also due to rule on another Russian swimmer, Yuliya Yefimova, who appealed against the IOCâ€™s decision to ban all Russian athletes who had served a ban. That decision has been heavily criticised because athletes from other countries who have served a ban, such as Justin Gatlin, are eligible to compete.",336,435,9.64E+17,fake

Put the tennis obituaries back in the file. Roger Federerâ€™s dream of a record eighth Wimbledon title is alive and well somehow after one of the most dramatic comebacks, even in his   career. Outgunned in the first two sets by the   Croat Marin Cilic, Federer pulled himself back from the dead, saving three   before squeezing out a   ( )       ( )   victory to secure a place in the   for the 11th time. It was a remarkable victory, his 10th from two sets down and one clinched with a 27th ace before celebrating with both arms thrust toward the sky. With his 35th birthday just around the corner and in a year in which he has been struck down with knee and back injuries, it may just go down as one of the most satisfying wins of his career. â€œWhen youâ€™re saving match points, when youâ€™re down two sets to love,     itâ€™s a moment when itâ€™s not in your control anymore,â€ said Federer, who now plays Canadaâ€™s No6 seed Milos Raonic, a         winner over the American Sam Querrey in Fridayâ€™s  . â€œBut I fought, I tried, I believed. At the end I got it done. So it was great on so many levels. This one is definitely huge because itâ€™s Centre Court at Wimbledon, and it still gives me the chance to win the tournament. â€ Federer is a confident beast rarely do we get the chance to see inside his psyche, any vulnerability kept well under wraps. But having missed the French Open with a back injury and having needed knee surgery in February, he arrived here lacking sharpness and miles in his legs. Four easy wins against significantly   opponents suggested he was playing well but even he has been surprised at his form. â€œI was very worried coming here,â€ he admitted. â€œI think it was huge for me to play the seven matches I did in Halle and Stuttgart. They served me very well. They gave me so much information to see what I could do, what I couldnâ€™t do, how I could play, how I couldnâ€™t play. â€œThen, knowing that I had a week in between, if I get through the first week here at Wimbledon   â€¦     I put myself in that position perfectly without dropping sets, which was a big surprise to me. Next thing, youâ€™re in the semis. Youâ€™re really deep into the tournament. I surprised myself in quite a big way actually. â€ Cilic beat Federer in the   at the US Open in 2014 on the way to his first grand slam title and for two sets it looked like he was about to do the same again. Though he was holding easily enough himself, Federer could not get a racket on the Cilic serve and the Croat played a superb   winning it   to take the first set and then one break, in the third game of the second, was enough to double his lead. The match turned on the seventh game of the third set, which was level at   when Federer escaped from   and then broke in the next game when Cilic  . The Swiss served out the set and though both missed break chances early in the fourth, Federer was hanging on. Cilic had three match points, the first at   the second at   and the third in the   only for Federer to come up with some clutch serving and when he took it   on his fifth set point, the worm had turned. Serving first in the deciding set, Federer had the edge and after missing a break point at   he finally broke for   and clinched victory with another ace out wide. Of his 27 aces, 15 came in the final two sets and Federer will now prepare to face Raonic, whom he beat at the same stage two years ago. Cilic was proud of his performance. â€œIt was a huge occasion and I played great tennis,â€ he said. â€œI was very close to the victory. Obviously itâ€™s not easy to deal with [the result]. â€œBut I have to take the positives and [think of] the great tennis that I managed to play. Itâ€™s the first time in my career I think that Iâ€™ve lost the match when I was two sets to love up but I havenâ€™t let myself down a little bit, physically or mentally. In all three sets [Federer won] I played pretty good tennis. â€œIf we would play again, I would try to be more aggressive on the chances when I had them in the fourth. Maybe there was a slight hesitation in some of them. The situation made it big. In those situations, I was not getting the best out of me. â€ As for Federer, who is now the oldest man since 1974 to make the Wimbledon   and draws level with Jimmy Connorsâ€™ open era best 11 appearances in the last four, the chance of an eighth title lives on. â€œI feel sorry for Marin but for me the dream continues,â€ he said. â€œI couldnâ€™t be happier, I thought I fought well and played   at the end. â€",113,232,"669658229861916673	669659590234136576	669659656915017728	669659665077153792	669659670429106177	669659669124677632	669659680545751040	669659684895240198	669660495205412864	669661466857967616	669661577096929280	669661611750064128	669661633803718657	669661737759735808	669663323743518720	669663501594431488	669665587619102721	669666244610625540	669667608510115840	669669432537387008	669669523381948416	669671229868109824	669671340144766977	669671763228426240	669672409788649472	669672415446757376	669672442357415936	669673761063374849	669673771351998464	669675528668909568	669675702677979136	669679888903749632	669680210506326021	669681484475813888	669684283380862976	669691985645694976	669697097147355136	669706553767960576	669707919189913600	669717736499445760	669721640423460866	669731439651520513	669734747103469568	669780944056807424	669794263786360832	669810387890507776	669851559623131136	669863010194890752	669868130987065344	669879447718248448	669887883600404480	669958538538553344	669977636072984576	669986061741899776	670045130125131776	670174535640096768	670224515947974656	670233736471044096	670376702065950720	670454118041960448	670455959794360320	670474848792014850	670842924440133632	670967727583043585	671335856926511104	672300356542402560	673200948764934147	679666435715538948",fake

The    who is gay, revealed he wanted to be a girl as he grew up and dressed exclusively as one when he was a child. He suggested that Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality and Olympian who was formerly Bruce Jenner, had made a mistake in undergoing gender transition and had â€œno clueâ€ what being transsexual involved. Everett, currently starring in the BBC1 show The Musketeers, told the Sunday Times magazine: â€œI really wanted to be a girl. Thank God the world of now wasnâ€™t then, because Iâ€™d be on hormones and Iâ€™d be a woman. After I was 15 I never wanted to be a woman again. â€  He believes parents who â€œget medicalâ€ are scary, saying: â€œItâ€™s nice to be allowed to express yourself, but the hormone thing, very young, is a big step. I think a lot of children have an ambivalence when theyâ€™re very young to what sex they are or what they feel about everyone. And there should be a way of embracing it. â€  He also spoke of how his former girlfriend Beatrice Dalle, the French actor, thought she might have been pregnant with his child. Everett told the magazine: â€œShe and I often talk about what would have happened if weâ€™d both had this child. And I would have loved to have had that child, actually. God, it probably would have been in rehab by now. â€  He also revealed that he was â€œturning into his motherâ€ and planned to move back in with her in Norfolk. â€¢ This article was amended on 20 June 2016. The Press Association misquoted Everett as telling the Sunday Times he opposed gender reassignment operations for children. In fact, Everett expressed reservations about hormone therapy.

The report was released by the National Guestworker Alliance (NGA) and is based on previous findings as well as interviews with 126 seafood processing workers in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and a range of   case studies. In order to succeed in a highly competitive global market, US seafood processors have increasingly come to rely on temporary labor. Such workers include   visa laborers as well as undocumented workers. Their immigration status makes these workers vulnerable to exploitation. The NGA found that these workers were unlikely to report abuse on the job due to threats from employers not to hire them in subsequent seasons and sponsor them for   visa. Undocumented workers have been threatened with immigration enforcement. â€œThis new research exposes a reality that workers know all too well,â€ said Daniel Castellanos, former   guest worker and a   of the NGA. â€œSeafood processing workers are routinely subjected to severe forms of exploitation by companies producing cheap seafood for major retailers and food distributors like Walmart. And when they speak out or try to resist abuse, they are punished severely for it. â€ A Walmart spokeswoman told the Guardian that the company cares about the men and women in its supply chain.  â€œWalmartâ€™s standards for suppliers lists our social and environmental expectations for our suppliers, specifically addressing working conditions, voluntary labor, pay, the cultivation of a safe and healthy work environment, and freedom of association,â€ she said. â€œWalmart also is committed to participating in collaborative efforts with external stakeholders to advance the goal of identifying risk and building a more transparent supply chain, including participation in industry groups that serve as a vehicle to share experiences and gain new information that can help improve operations and the global supply chains as a whole. â€ Among the indicators of forced labor detected by NGA in the US supply chain were verbal abuse, curfews, threats of denunciation to immigration authorities and poor treatment by supervisors. Those workers surveyed also reported having their wages stolen, not being paid overtime, and being paid less than originally promised. According to the report, a majority of workers processing scallops and groundfish in the large plants in New Bedford were hired on a temporary basis. The NGA also referenced a 2009 report that found nearly 75% of seafood processing workers in the city â€œwere undocumented migrants, generally hired through temp agenciesâ€. In Louisiana, seafood employers rely heavily on   visa workers. According to the NGA, utilization of   visas among seafood employers tripled between 1990 and 2000. â€œIn the 1970s, when I started my business, I was lucky enough to have the refugees from Vietnam come in, so we brought in roughly 40 of them to help us through that time,â€ Frank Randol, president of   crawfish processor Randol Inc told Congress last year. â€œOver the course of the years, we came to the 1990s when that started to wane just a little bit, we discovered the   program and started bringing in the guestworkers from Mexico. â€  Randol described the jobs at his processing plant as â€œone of Americaâ€™s least desired jobsâ€ and said that union activity has made it difficult for him to hire workers.  The NGA report was released at the end of the International Labour Conference, which is currently being held in Geneva. The NGA has called on the International Labour Organization (ILO) to â€œmove towards a binding legal convention regulating global value chainsâ€. The alliance also asked the ILO to organize a conference to explore the adverse impact of contracting and purchasing practices on migrant workersâ€™ rights, and to assemble research on how purchasing practices of multinational corporations affect core labor standards and the wages and benefits of workers. â€œEven on the end of seafood supply chains in the US, competition from   producers in Asia and elsewhere has created a powerful incentive for US processors to cut labor costs through wage theft, unsafe working conditions and at times forced labor conditions,â€ said JJ Rosenbaum, the NGAâ€™s legal adviser. â€œAs the report shows, the ILOâ€™s role ensuring decent work including living wages and the right to organize for all supply chain workers is fundamental to reverse the race to the bottom and support workers and their organizations in raising standards. â€",5,5,,fake

Last week, it was reported and then denied that his music was to be put up for sale. Now, we have news that it is to begin seeing the light of day. Donâ€™t get too excited, though, because thereâ€™s not going to be a great rush of songs. The big news for fans is that his 1984 album Purple Rain is to be reissued in a deluxe, remastered version, featuring a second disc of previously unreleased material. What that material might be is unknown, as is the release date. All that is known is that the record will emerge in early 2017, and will be based on plans agreed with Prince before his death in April. The Purple Rain reissue will be preceded by a new a new   compilation, Prince 4Ever, to be released next month. While that album is almost entirely greatest hits, thereâ€™s one treat for fans (or a shameless attempt to get them to shell out for music they already have, depending on your point of view) in the form of Moonbeam Levels, a previously unreleased track. Previously unreleased does not, in this case, mean previously unheard. The track is a   favourite among Prince fans, well enough known to have been covered in concert by Elvis Costello. You can find it on YouTube if you want to.

politifact14213,https://www.unilad.co.uk/science/nasa-confirms-15-days-of-darkness-coming-this-month/,‘NASA Confirms’ 15 Days Of Darkness Coming This Month,"Donald Trump has made the most direct appeal of his campaign to African American voters as he battles to offset dismal polling among black voters and draw political capital from a recent spate of racially charged unrest in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Riots broke out in Milwaukeeâ€™s Sherman Park area on Saturday after the fatal police shooting of black    Sylville Smith, who police said pointed a firearm at an officer after fleeing a traffic stop. The overwhelmingly black neighborhood remained on edge after the city imposed a night curfew, fearing further unrest after arrests and gunfire on Sunday evening. Speaking at a rally on Tuesday night in the rural town of West Bend, 30 miles from Milwaukee, Trump, who has branded himself the â€œlaw and order candidateâ€ told an almost exclusively white audience that the rioting was â€œan assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and to live in peaceâ€  â€”   and said black people were the biggest victims of violence in their neighborhoods. â€œLaw and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities,â€ Trump said. â€œThe main victims of these riots are   African American citizens living in these neighborhoods. Itâ€™s their job, itâ€™s their homes, itâ€™s their schools and communities which will suffer the most as a result. â€ Trump said he was asking for â€œthe vote of every African American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different futureâ€. â€œIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths,â€ he said. â€œThe Democratic party has failed and betrayed the African American community. â€  Recent analysis has indicated that Trump is polling at around 2% with the African American electorate  â€”   worse than almost every Republican candidate since 1948  â€”   and is even behind the Green party nominee, Jill Stein, and libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, placing him fourth overall among black voters.  Party insiders have begun urging their nominee to increase his outreach in African American communities nationwide. He has done little to court the demographic, most recently rejecting invitations to speak at the annual conventions of the NAACP and the National Association of Black Journalists. Trumpâ€™s rally on Tuesday evening had been scheduled before unrest broke out in Milwaukee but he seized on the opportunity to accuse his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of being â€œagainst the policeâ€ and suggested she and other Democrats were directly responsible for rioting in the city and others around America. â€œThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  â€”   a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  â€”   share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country,â€ Trump said in a speech that was delivered using a teleprompter. The billionaire accused Clinton of preferring to â€œprotect the offender [rather] than the victimâ€ suggested that â€œa vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunitiesâ€. He argued that African Americans had been â€œhurt worstâ€ by Clintonâ€™s immigration policy. Trump reiterated claims first made during his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention in July, suggesting that â€œlaw and order must be restoredâ€ amid rising homicide rates in Americaâ€™s largest 50 cities. Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime has in fact declined to historic lows under the Obama administration. The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing â€œthe bestâ€ prosecutors and judges and pursuing â€œstrong enforcementâ€ of federal laws. This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, according to recent polling while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americansâ€™ support for police was at a   low and especially weakened among the African American population. Trumpâ€™s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of Americaâ€™s   history, was on sale outside of the rally. The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a   radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of Americaâ€™s most racially segregated metropolitan areas. â€œThatâ€™s the way they (black people) are in that city,â€ said Ken Schladweiler, a    from the small rural town of Neosho. â€œAll of that (unrest connected to Smithâ€™s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. Theyâ€™re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. Thatâ€™s just the way they are. â€ His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: â€œAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: donâ€™t they (black people) have work? Theyâ€™re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Donâ€™t they have work?â€ Julie Wanie, a    healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didnâ€™t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all. â€œI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows thatâ€™s a certain area you stay out of. â€ Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: â€œI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars. â€ In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released. â€œ  â€¦     The gun was pointed at his (a police officerâ€™s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? Thatâ€™s what the narrative is,â€ Trump said. â€œMaybe itâ€™s not true. If it is true, people shouldnâ€™t be rioting. â€ While Trumpâ€™s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists. Just hours before Trumpâ€™s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a   statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime. â€œNow more than ever itâ€™s important to have   conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trumpâ€™s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,â€ Serpas

politifact13897,https://www.huzlers.com/snoop-dogg-arrested-conspiracy-talking-murder-trump-video/,Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His ‘Murder Trump’ Video,", â€œRight now Iâ€™m thinking that I will be voting for Donald Trump,â€ said Kyle Hover. â€œThe idea of the Democratic party is more what I donâ€™t really fit along with. Yeah, we do need social programs to help the people that need help, but theyâ€™re just running rampant in this country right now. â€ Hover is not a rabid Trump supporter at a rally. He is an    computer science major at Hofstra University, in New York  â€”   where the   first presidential debate will be taking place on Monday night.  You might not expect to find many Trump supporters at an allegedly liberal college, but the Republican nomineeâ€™s reach is extensive, despite his litany of offensive comments towards women, ethnic minorities and his various political opponents. â€œThose are part of the things I donâ€™t agree with,â€ Hover said, when asked if he too, feels that Mexico is sending rapists to the US, and if he agrees with Trumpâ€™s treatment of women. â€œI do feel that gender equality and racial equality are more towards the top of what I like to see brought out in a presidential campaign,â€ Hover said. The    did not find too many issues with Trumpâ€™s other remarks on the trail. A recent poll showed Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by  % among those under 35. This year millennials (broadly speaking, people born between 1981 and 1997) overtook the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) as the largest generation in the US. Shanon Thomas, a    womenâ€™s studies and criminology major, is among those planning to vote for Clinton. Thomas said she wanted to hear the former New York senator address inequality during the debate. â€œShe will do a good job in bringing equality to this country,â€ Thomas said. â€œThatâ€™s the only way we can get ourselves back to being great  â€”   as opposed to what other candidates think make America great. â€ She was referencing the baseball hats that Trump has been wearing and selling as part of his campaign. Trumpâ€™s other business ventures have included a board game, vodka and meat.  An    political science major called Doreen, who asked that her last name not be published, said the candidates should focus on racial issues. â€œI think definitely things regarding police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement, that definitely is something that needs to be talked about,â€ she said. Doreen, who is African American, referenced the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. â€œI feel scared,â€ she said.  â€œWatching the video of what happened in Tulsa itâ€™s kind of like that could have been anybody.  â€œThat couldâ€™ve been my dad, that could have been anyone in the world that I know.

politifact14887,https://proconservativenews.com/shaquille-oneal-says-trump-is-possibly-the-best-president-of-the-president-of-all-times-ever-he-is-not-afraid-to/,"Shaquille O’Neal Says: ‘Trump Is Possibly The Best President Of The President Of All Times Ever, He Is Not Afraid To…’","Weâ€™ve never needed cheering up more though on the strictly escapist level, this film is maybe compromised by making one of its characters an obnoxious rich New York chump, a charmless lump, or do I mean grump, reliant on his fatherâ€™s money and nursing political ambitions. â€œHeâ€™s been mentioned as a future president,â€ says someone. Surely not. .. That entertainment enchanter JK Rowling has come storming back to the world of magic in a shower of supernatural sparks   and created a glorious   adventure, all about the wizards of   America and the diffident wizarding Brit who causes chaos in their midst with a bagful of exotic creatures. Itâ€™s a lovely performance from Eddie Redmayne who is a pretty fantastic beast himself. Thereâ€™s a moment when he has to â€œwhisperâ€ an errant animal into submission and his contortions would put Andy Serkis to shame. His Newt is a connoisseur, scientist and scatterbrained   taxonomist who is not far from the   Dr Who, a specless Potter or beardless Darwin. Redmayneâ€™s distinctively breathy voice even has something of the young Attenborough. With the openness and likability of his screen presence, and the sheer generosity of   energy, he and the cast are giving us an early Christmas treat.  Potter veteran David Yates directs and Rowling has adapted the Hogwarts textbook Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, by one Newt Scamander: the first name is short for â€œNewtonâ€ and nothing to do with the witchâ€™s ingredient. This was a fictional work of magical scholarship first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone and which Rowling herself wrote out and published in aid of Comic Relief a couple of years later. So who was Scamander? Rowling gives us the answer by converting this static encyclopaedia into a spectacular   about the origins of his book, set in New York City of the prewar era, 70 or 80 years before Philosopherâ€™s Stone. Does that make it a prequel? Sort of. There are a few hints and allusions, including a namecheck for Dumbledore. It promises to be the first of a series and it wouldnâ€™t surprise me to learn that Rowling already has every detail sorted out for the entire saga in architectural detail  â€”   and that she got it straight in her mind before writing the first Potter.  Fantastic Beasts is a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment with some breathtaking digital fabrications of prewar New York City. This is Steampunk 2. 0, taking its inspirations from Terry Gilliamâ€™s Brazil or Howard Hawksâ€™s His Girl Friday but the New York she creates also has the dark, traumatised look of Gotham City. The American wizards themselves are subject to an internal debate about their attitude to the civilians in America a muggle is known as a â€œ â€. Itâ€™s a schism that threatens to reach   proportions.  The donnish and unworldly Newt arrives in New York on the hunt for some rare species, and just so happens to be carrying quite a few exotic specimens himself in his battered suitcase with its worryingly insecure clasps. But the city in which he has just arrived has been threatened by some kind of dark   of dark magic, smashing its way through streets and buildings, which is called an obscurial.  Daft Newt causes calamity almost immediately on arriving by creating a rumpus in a bank with his animals  â€”   and a quirk of fate means he forms the unlikeliest of friendships with a   Jacob Kowlaski (a beguiling performance from Dan Fogler) an   stuck in a factory job but nursing big dreams about opening his own bakery. But Newt, our   gentleman amateur from across the pond, exasperates the US wizard authorities and in particular their tough operative Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who herself has issues with her superiors. Tina finds herself having to protect Newt and Jacob and brings our two amigos back to the apartment she shares with her telepathic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) who gets the hots for Jacob. And might there also be a spark between Newt and Tina? Meanwhile, creepy   activist Mary Lou (Samantha Morton) and her adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) appear to have a disquieting connection with top   Percival Graves (Colin Farrell). Itâ€™s a very Rowling universe, dense with fun, but always taking its own jeopardy very seriously and effortlessly making you do the same. The Beasts movies may actually make clearer Rowlingâ€™s   debt to Roald Dahl. They also show that her universe with its exotic fauna is in the best way, a cousin to that of George Lucas.  There is a strange pleasure of seeing how her magic itself is as potent as ever. The muggle or   world we are seeing is nearly a century old, but the basic language and furniture and procedure of magic is not in any way older or rudimentary. It is the same thing. They have moving pictures on newspapers in the same way as the present day. As ever, magic is a state within a state, a secret in plain sight, and part of the fun is being let in on the secret.  Katherine Waterston is great as Tina and perhaps gives the Rowling universe what it never quite had until now: a really strong young female lead who could tackle the bad guys on equal terms with the man   as well as having the chops for romance.  Rowling and Yates have given us a terrifically   unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film.

politifact15487,http://redstatewave.com/article.asp?id=128635,BREAKING: Mike Huckabee Just Fired!,"A US government request to trawl through the personal data of millions of users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase signals the start of an effort to pull digital currencies like bitcoin into the mainstream, experts have said. The â€œJohn Doeâ€ summons, a broad order for data on all Coinbase users in 2013, 2014 and 2015, was filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a federal court in California on 17 November. In the summons, the IRS said that all of Coinbaseâ€™s users in that period â€œhave not been or may not be complying with US internal revenue lawsâ€. Coinbase has said it will fight the request in court. Cryptocurrencies  â€”   digital assets which exist entirely online but are exchangeable for goods or services  â€”   have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because they grant a degree of user anonymity. Coinbase is the largest bitcoin exchange and its   brand. But user confidentiality has also caused headaches for governments, who worry the currencies are being used for drug dealing, money laundering or tax evasion. Digital currencies are currently taxed as an asset like gold, with capital gains tax due when there is an appreciation in value. However, the extent to which bitcoin users with US tax liabilities have been declaring such assets is unclear.  In documentation supporting its petition, the IRS referred to three anonymous cases of taxpayers who had used virtual currencies to evade tax, two of which were â€œcorporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollarsâ€ which used Coinbase wallets and concealed bitcoin transactions as â€œtechnology expensesâ€ on their tax returns. Several experts in cryptocurrency said that the IRS was on a â€œfishing expeditionâ€ and pointed out that it followed an excoriating report by the US treasuryâ€™s   for taxation which said the IRS was not doing enough to regulate and investigate cryptocurrencies. â€œThe government has no idea that anybody has committed a crime,â€ said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a lobbying and research group focused on cryptocurrencies. In a statement, Coinbase said: â€œAlthough Coinbaseâ€™s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the governmentâ€™s request. â€ It added: â€œIn its current form, we will oppose the governmentâ€™s petition in court. â€ Some experts, though dismayed by what they saw as the overly broad and invasive nature of the request, said that more government scrutiny on cryptocurrencies was inevitable as they became more mainstream.  â€œItâ€™s an indication of bitcoinâ€™s growing adoption,â€ said Chris Burniske, an analyst at ARK Investment Management who focuses on bitcoin. â€œAs more people use it, it is going to grow in a way which affects national and global economies, so the IRS needs more clarity on how citizens are using it,â€ he said. â€œGlobally, weâ€™re seeing regulators grapple with how to regulate and tax [cryptocurrencies]. â€  Others said that while they felt Coinbase was right to seek to narrow the scope of the request, some change was needed to bring bitcoin and its ilk out of the dark and into the world of mainstream finance.  â€œIf bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be viewed as legitimate financial instruments, there has to be some regulatory apparatus here,â€ said Kevin McIntyre, associate professor of economics at McDaniel College in Maryland. â€œCertainly,â€ he added, â€œthe tinfoil   libertarian types who embrace the privacy of [bitcoin] are going to be very disappointed. â€ Not all of them, however. Juan Llanos, an advisor in financial technology regulation and compliance, said he was seeing a lot of anger within the cryptocurrency industry at the IRSâ€™s move, but also some schadenfreude from the more anarchistic parts of bitcoinâ€™s user base.  â€œCoinbase has been attacked by   from the beginning, because they are the closest to a digital bank there is,â€ he said. â€œMany anarchists  â€”   usually the early adopters of bitcoin  â€”   who are against the customs of Coinbase are celebrating,â€ he said. This is not the first time the IRS has used blanket John Doe summonses as part of an investigation, though it is possible that the Coinbase request will be the largest of its kind. In 2014, a federal judge approved similar summonses for FedEx, DHL and UPS to produce information about taxpayers who use an offshore   service called Sovereign Management  Legal, and in 2015 a judge approved another summons for US taxpayers with offshore accounts at Belize Bank International Limited.",364,665,,fake

During a weekend of protests over killings by police, more than 160 people were arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where demonstrations continued to grow over the fatal shooting by officers last week of Alton Sterling, a    African American, as he was pinned down during a struggle.   vehicles, teargas and smoke grenades returned to American streets for the first time this summer, and Barack Obama appealed for calm and said those who attack law enforcement undermine the cause of social justice. The unrest built as authorities in Dallas said Micah Johnson, who opened fire on officers late last Thursday, had been plotting a wider bombing campaign that could have had â€œdevastating effectsâ€. Johnson was said to have been seeking revenge for the policeâ€™s treatment of African Americans.  Among the protesters arrested was DeRay Mckesson, a   national leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said Mckesson was arrested for blocking a street even as video he was livestreaming at the time of his detention indicated that he was off the roadway. He was released from custody late Sunday with a charge of â€œsimple obstruction of a highway of commerceâ€. Protesters complained they were being denied their rights to peaceful assembly. â€œIn cities across America, police are responding to peaceful protests with provocation, violence, and unconstitutional arrests,â€ said Samuel Sinyangwe, a prominent activist with the group Campaign Zero and a close ally of Mckessonâ€™s. Another 100 people were arrested during clashes with police in and around St Paul, Minnesota, where the death of Philando Castile after his shooting by a police officer last week was broadcast live on Facebook, causing widespread public anger. As protesters blocked an interstate highway, police flooded streets in Bearcat military vehicles and used smoke bombs to break up demonstrations. The police chief, Todd Axtell, said about 20 of his officers had been struck with bottles, rocks and other items pelted at them by crowds, which he said was â€œa disgraceâ€. Dozens more protesters were detained by police during protests in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore and Phoenix, where police used teargas and pepper spray to disperse crowds. More protests were planned for late on Sunday, including in St Louis, Missouri, where in August 2014 an unarmed black    was killed in the suburb of Ferguson in a flashpoint that continues to reverberate two years later. Tensions have risen even as the city of Dallas mourns the   killings of five police officers last week by Johnson, a    army veteran and member of the New Black Panther party. On Sunday, the Dallas police chief, David Brown, said investigators had found   equipment and written evidence indicating that Johnson was plotting attacks â€œlarge enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our north Texas areaâ€. â€œWeâ€™re convinced that this suspect had other plans, and thought what he was doing was righteous,â€ he added. Brown said Johnson had apparently been planning to â€œtarget law enforcement, and make us pay for what he sees as law enforcementâ€™s efforts to punish people of colourâ€ since before last weekâ€™s fatal shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, which merely triggered his actions. The police chief disclosed that Johnson had daubed the letters â€œRBâ€ in his own blood on a wall of the parking garage where he was cornered and eventually killed by a police robot. The significance of the initials were unclear. Investigators have also learned that Johnson had practiced   drills in his backyard and trained at a private   school that teaches special tactics, including â€œshooting on the moveâ€ a technique in which an attacker fires and quickly changes position, to keep his location uncertain and create the impression of multiple assailants. The deaths of Sterling and Castile had had apparently moved Johnson to act before his more ambitious plan could be realised, Brown said. The gunman had kept a journal of combat tactics, Brown said, but his writings included â€œquite a bit of rambling in the journal thatâ€™s hard to decipherâ€.  The police chief also revealed details of the   standoff between the gunman and police, which ended when officers sent a robot carrying a pound of C4 explosive to detonate near Johnson. The gunman, hidden in a brick corner where snipers could not see him and officers could not safely approach, demanded to speak only with a black police negotiator, Brown said. â€œHe lied to us, laughing, playing games, singing, asking how many did he get and saying he wanted to kill some more,â€ he said. The police chief eventually made the decision to improvise with the robot. â€œI began to feel he was going to charge us and take out many more before we would kill him,â€ Brown said, adding: â€œI approved [the decision] and Iâ€™d do it again under the same circumstances. â€ Obama cut short a visit to Europe early this week and will travel to Dallas before convening a summit at the White House between police chiefs and community leaders. Speaking Spain on Sunday, he defended the â€œmessy and controversialâ€ tradition of American protest but reiterated his condemnation of violence against law enforcement. â€œWhenever those of us who are concerned about failure of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause,â€ Obama said. Also on Sunday, Dallasâ€™s mayor, Mike Rawlings, said marchers carrying weapons and dressed in body armor had distracted law enforcement from the actual gunman on Thursday, telling CBSâ€™s Face the Nation that other individuals carrying guns on the scene â€œtook our eye off the ball for a momentâ€. â€œYou can carry a rifle legally and when you have gunfire going on, you usually go with the person thatâ€™s got a gun,â€ he said. â€œAnd so our police grabbed some of those individuals, took them to police headquarters and worked it out and figured out that they were not the shooters. But that is one of the real issues with the gun rights issues that we face  â€”   that in the middle of a firefight, itâ€™s hard to pick out the good guys and the bad guys. â€ He added that investigators were talking to Johnsonâ€™s neighbors and family to learn whether â€œthereâ€™s anybody that aided and abetted him, conspired with him. We donâ€™t have any new news on that regard. That is probably going to take some days. â€",534,737,"907278167076982785	907288894772858880	907297803721957377	907298768940421121	907301756895449088	907303961270607874	907308515190083585	907310722698358785	907311365035106304	907312500219301889	907312807238098944	907312836820574208	907319355704270848	907321850790862850	907321899918774272	907325215071510528	907328999210274816	907332020891738112	907332477131337729	907336377137864704	907340500612665344	907359748898672640	907360716159565824	907363480520597504	907366948102696961	907369061776011264	907381319277187073	907390878741925895	907395168143278082	907452127047553024	907452134857342976	907548540926349312	907548676276588544	907580456031461376	907624577504817152	907642690631737344	908459283922259968",fake
politifact14519,http://freedomdaily.com/muslims-plan-grocery-stores-bare-irma/, BREAKING Muslims’ Disturbing Plan Comes Out After Grocery Stores Go Bare To Prepare For Irma,"As if the routine vulgarities of Donald Trump havenâ€™t made politics depressing enough, the New York state assembly is now on its second year of debating whether or not to rename State Route 107 in Oyster Bay, Long Island, â€œBilly Joel Boulevardâ€ in honor of the Piano Man himself. While fellow   Bob Dylan is basking in the glory of a Nobel Prize for literature, Billy Joel canâ€™t even get the state of New York to write his name on a street sign. Someone should write a song about that. The crux of the argument over the renaming is that Joel is not yet deceased, making the honor premature. People who get streets and roads named after them and statues erected in their likeness tend to be two things: male, as this New Yorker article points out, and dead. Billy Joel is definitely a man, as you would know if youâ€™ve heard the song Big Shot, but unfortunately for his bid for getting a patch of asphalt named after him, heâ€™s still ticking. Never in my gravest nightmares did I imagine that Christie Brinkleyâ€™s   could be a wedge issue in an election involving human adults in the year 2016. This could only be dumber if the debate was over whether or not to name an abandoned subway tunnel after Rick Springfield. â€œMy opponent is either impotent or is simply not trying, because everyone loves Billy Joel,â€ Democratic assembly candidate Dean Hart said about incumbent Republican Michael Montesano in a press release issued on Thursday. Yes, he issued a press release. The world must know! Michael Montesano doesnâ€™t care about classic rock!  â€œNext to Teddy Roosevelt, Long Island really doesnâ€™t have a more famous or popular person than Billy Joel,â€ Hart continues. Bit of a gulf in significance there. We go from a former president of the United States to the man famous for writing Scenes from an Italian Restaurant. Excuse me, but Long Island also gave us guitarist Joe Satriani, Amy Fisher, Stuttering John Melendez from the Howard Stern Show, and former NFL quarterback Vinnie Testaverde. Iâ€™d mention Thomas Pynchon, but Iâ€™ve clearly already proved my point. Nevertheless, hasnâ€™t Billy Joel done enough, his supporters ask? The residents of suburban New York donâ€™t even bother hiring a DJ for their weddings any more. They just play The Nylon Curtain on repeat and no one complains. But more importantly, shouldnâ€™t Billy Joel get to see Billy Joel Boulevard before he departs this earth? I might not be much of a fan of his, but as a fellow human, I can sympathize with those who want to recognize him while heâ€™s still around. Consider the funeral. Your loved ones dress you up in expensive clothes, toss you in a box lined with silk or velvet, then eat a bunch of cheese and drink a few glasses of wine at midday. They say wonderful things about you, pray that youâ€™ve gone to a bespoke afterlife that caters to your every whim, and, most importantly, remark on how good you look. â€œThey did a great job cleaning Dave up,â€ theyâ€™ll say as they gawp at my eerily beatific, rotting corpse. I donâ€™t get to see any of that  â€”   Iâ€™m dead! No wine, no cheese, no silk prison box, and no fancy suit. All the best parts of being dead are lost on the corpse. Why deny Billy Joel the right to see his name slapped on a green road sign before he travels â€œuptownâ€ for real. These sorts of honors really only serve one purpose, and thatâ€™s to lend the honoree a semblance of immortality. Your body might quit working, but there will always be that road for kids to ask their exasperated parents, â€œwhoâ€™s Billy Joel?â€ The more roads, bridges, burn units, sports arenas, museums and vape shops with our names on them, the greater chance we have of not fading into obscurity. At least, thatâ€™s the theory. Nevermind that Billy Joel is already the guy who sang Only the Good Die Young (thatâ€™s a bit of a laugh now, eh? ).  Granted, youâ€™ll still very much not alive, no matter how many places someone has scribbled your name. Also, State Route 107 might be ripped up and replaced with a tube system for   cars in the next 50 years. For now, at least, Billy Joel should be able to drive over a stretch of road bearing his name. Itâ€™s as close as any of us get to enjoying our inevitable demise.  Actually, a Nobel Prize would be nice too.",2,146,"905567565841182720	905568329590550531	905568871779893249	905568999852965889	905569329961472000	905569600313720832	905570250040717312	905570678207897600	905572236056305664	905573340835790848	905576135987150848	905626464757964800	905702871412432897	905730399011303425	905733448693719040	905832155468718080	905969108545622016	905973551315996672	905985786440552449	906219228637929472",fake
politifact11773,http://www.occupydemocrats.com/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/,Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom,"Chess has dropped almost completely from the public eye in the four decades since Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky waged their Cold War proxy battle in Reykjavik. This monthâ€™s world chess championship match in New York City will do little to reverse that course despite the organizersâ€™ best intentions, but early returns suggest the taut showdown between champion Magnus Carlsen and challenger Sergey Karjakin may not be as straightforward as initially suspected. It marks the first time New York has played host to a world title match since 1995, when Garry Kasparov retained his title against Viswanathan Anand on the   observatory deck in the south tower of the World Trade Center. For the past week Carlsen and Karjakin have faced off in a   studio within a sleek   arena on the third floor of the Fulton Market Building, only four blocks east from where the towers once stood. A   mirror allows spectators to watch the players in action, by themselves save for two silent arbiters, lending a   feel to the spectacle. Prices range from $75 for general admission to $1, 200 for VIP lounge access, where   can suck down vodka cocktails and rub elbows with grandmasters, financiers and the odd celebrity. Woody Harrelson, an avid player himself, spent most of the first two days taking challenges from   on the outdoor balcony overlooking the East River while Carlsen and Karjakin faced off inside. The     match began on Friday, with each contestant awarded one point for a win and a   for a draw. So far Carlsen and Karjakin have drawn all four games theyâ€™ve played and enter Thursdayâ€™s fifth meeting deadlocked at  . Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion, earning the winnerâ€™s share of a roughly $1. 1m prize fund. Carlsen, who is 25, was already regarded as the worldâ€™s best player even before he saw off Anand for the championship in Chennai three years ago and is the closest thing to a star in the sport today. Heâ€™s done ads for Porsche, modeled for   Raw alongside Liv Tyler and Lily Cole and enjoys a massive presence in his native Norway, where NRK is broadcasting the games in prime time. He is handsome and media trained, perhaps overly so, giving off the air of an unthreatening playboy. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history, a point frequently cited by those who have called him the greatest player ever. Karjakin, 26, earned the right to challenge for the title in March by making it through the Candidates Tournament in Moscow, where he defeated a series of   opponents, among them Brooklynâ€™s Fabiano Caruana. He was born in Ukraine, where he became an international grandmaster at 12 years old (a record that still stands) but adopted Russian citizenship in 2009. He is married with a son, an avowed supporter of Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Crimea, and speaks with a stutter that surfaces more in English than his native tongue. He is ranked ninth in the world. Karjakin is a player in the classical mold known for his resilience. Carlsen is known for his adaptability, which enables a flair for the unpredictable not commonly seen among top players. â€œ[Carlsen] has practically no weaknesses,â€ the Russian said at last weekâ€™s   press conference before more than one hundred credentialed media.  Any expectations of the political intrigue and paranoia associated with the sportâ€™s golden age were not disappointed. Israel Gelfer, the vice president of the world chess federation, spoke on behalf of the governing body only because Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was barred from entering the country due to his ties to the Syrian government and the Central Bank of Syria. At one point Carlsen fielded a question over the rumors that heâ€™d enlisted Microsoft for cybersecurity consultation over concerns Karjakinâ€™s team were trying to hack his preparations. No fewer than two questions were posed about   never mind that Carlsen and Karjakin were years away from being born when the Match of the Century took place. This time around in New York, the chess eventually went off, no doubt to the organizersâ€™ relief, and it didnâ€™t take long for the first surprise. Carlsen, handling the white pieces, played the   Trompowsky Attack in Fridayâ€™s first game, a   opening heâ€™d later confess was at least partially inspired by the name of Americaâ€™s newly minted  . The Norwegian played fast and it seemed like heâ€™d outprepared his rival, but Karjakin managed to scratch back to force a mostly forgettable draw after 42 moves. Karjakin played the far more familiar Ruy Lopez in Saturdayâ€™s second game, prompting a Morphy Defense from Carlsen. That also ended in a draw, this time on the 33rd move. After Sundayâ€™s rest day the players reconvened for Game 3, a   of a contest that saw Karjakin recover from a misstep on his 30th move before defending brilliantly as Carlsen tried to press his advantage and draw first blood. But after seven tense, excruciating hours, Karjakin managed to salvage a draw when the champion missed a move in the endgame that would have assured checkmate.  Moments later, they agreed to a draw after 78 moves. That left a short turnaround for the following dayâ€™s game, where Karjakin recovered yet again to force a   marathon that ended in another draw and kept the match level. The resilience that Carlsen had praised on the eve of the match has proven the critical talking point as the match enters the middle act: â€œSergey has studied the game very well, is very knowledgeable and, most of all, heâ€™s extremely resilient in defense. Heâ€™s very, very good in finding resources even in difficult positions, finding positions he can defend.  â€œFor me, itâ€™s a matter of when I get the chance, Iâ€™ll try to punch him until he finally knocks over. â€ It seems inevitable that Carlsenâ€™s blows will find their target, but for now the Russian underdog is very much in the fight.",715,166,"687019297957351425	687019367280820224	687020639534854144	687021390550167553	687021691692814341	687022111169224705	687022280690413568	687024085692473344	687028317543870464	687029195579379713	687029323270897664	687029977305464832	687030926858149888	687031191132831744	687031622760329216	687033281091600384	687033519432843264	687033977723420672	687034185685577730	687035830217605120	687036777924722688	687037822759481344	687038940658950145	687038995256197121	687040837755219968	687041976454230018	687042865424429056	687044508199026690	687044595742539777	687045176053792768	687048350613565446	687049085103259648	687050135642206208	687050294102888448	687053533640798208	687053901787353088	687054435407675392	687056897497772033	687057536122368000	687065862784839681	687065962739191808	687066315178295297	687066339115024385	687067566116712448	687070502121271296	687073322862047233	687073888434532352	687074645640658945	687078377560391680	687078668313563137	687078848597487616	687081027718623232	687081540140941312	687081881440010240	687082109794648064	687082890958639105	687082962588848128	687085712940883968	687085726245109760	687086633770967047	687102952381652992	687108855067590656	687121807426629632	687125202489098241	687129655535648770	687137710973317120	687146716093648896	687169818798194688	687174139430436864	687195942806749184	687260127339085825	687263365023019008	687269428719927296	687271626388434944	687277628626235392	687335707791208449	687347348285054976	687357606206148609	687366279276003328	687368330131410944	687398510380093440	687402708165242880	687406889500553217	687424445921755136	687516108530839552	687745664822845440	688060151732002821	688188784672821248	688519542054727680	688747892132057088	689741920587911168	691422976038834178	694329384610729989",fake
politifact14270,https://www.inverse.com/article/21717-leonardo-dicaprio-barack-obama-elon-musk-mars-trio-sxsl,Leonardo DiCaprio Tells President Obama That He's Going to Mars,"The German political mainstream is getting increasingly nervous about the effect that the rise of fake news might have on federal elections next autumn. Fake news and Russian interference  â€”   either by influencing fake news sites, or by hacking or misinformation  â€”   are viewed as a serious threat to the democratic process, particularly since the US presidential elections. From rumours that Merkel was in the east German secret police, the Stasi, to others suggesting she is Adolf Hitlerâ€™s daughter, Germans are also proving themselves susceptible to false information. The most blatant example of fake news to hit Germany so far occurred earlier this year over reports that a    girl of Russian origin, known as Lisa F, had been raped in Berlin by refugees from the Middle East. The story received extensive coverage on Russian and German media who reported the allegations that she had been abducted on her way to school and  . The attack turned out to have been fabricated, as Berlinâ€™s chief of police was quick to point out. According to Berlinâ€™s public prosecutorâ€™s office the girl had spent 30 hours with people known to her, and a medical examination proved she had not been raped. But having been shared widely on social media and through Russian news sites, hundreds took to the streets to protest at the â€œattackâ€ along with far right and   groups. Sergey Lavrov, Russiaâ€™s foreign minister went so far as to accuse Merkelâ€™s government of â€œsweeping the case under the carpetâ€ heightening suspicions in Berlin that the Kremlin was deliberately trying to cause trouble. There are suspicions that the story was spread in the first place by Russian elements keen to undermine the refugee policy of Angela Merkel. She is viewed as a key enemy to Russia over her tough stance on Ukraine. The ultimate aim is said to be to destabilise her domestically just as she has said she will stand for a fourth term in office. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine   MaaÃŸen  â€”   the head of the BfV, Germanyâ€™s domestic security agency,  â€”   accused Russia of using   techniques of misinformation. Addressing the Bundestag on the subject last week, Merkel said: â€œToday we have fake sites, bots, trolls  â€”   things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms, and we have to learn to deal with them. â€ Fake news has also spread to neighbouring Austria and been used to discredit both candidates in this weekendâ€™s presidential election. Most startling have been the attacks on the   independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen, whose opponents have attempted to spread the news that he is suffering from dementia and is gravely ill.  Kate Connolly, Over the last 10 years, France has seen a sharp increase in the readership of alternative,   sites, blogs and social media operations, referred to collectively as the fachosphÃ¨re  â€”   (â€œfachoâ€ is slang for fascist). Promoting views including   nativism and   these sites are run independently, rather than by a political party. But they feed into a mood of distrust of the traditional media, both on the far right and the far left. Samuel Laurent, head of Le Mondeâ€™s   section, Les dÃ©codeurs, said: â€œIn France, there isnâ€™t a wide presence of totally invented fake news that makes money through advertising, as seen in the US. â€ But he said France was seeing increasing cases of manipulation and distortion, particularly during election periods.  One example, in the recent primary race to choose the French rightâ€™s presidential candidate, was a campaign on the fachosphÃ¨re to claim the   candidate Alain JuppÃ© was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The accusation dated back to local elections in 2014 when distorted stories circulated on a   opinion website, accusing JuppÃ© of wanting to build a â€œ â€ in Bordeaux, where he is mayor. The story grew and was embellished during the primary campaigns to portray JuppÃ© as a Muslim   â€œAli JuppÃ©â€. JuppÃ© said a â€œdisgusting campaignâ€ had been run against him.  Laurent said: â€œI think the French presidential election campaign [next spring] will be fraught with this type of thing. â€ In January, as the presidential election campaign prepares to kick off, Le Mondeâ€™s Les dÃ©codeurs will launch a database of questionable sites that portray themselves as information sites. The recent Paris terrorist attacks were also subject to conspiracy theories and distortions, including reports this summer that gunmen who killed 90 people at a rock gig at the Bataclan last November had mutilated their victims. These reports cited partial evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the attacks, without adding that the inquiry also heard officials deny that any mutilation took place. There is also an ongoing row over fake information websites about abortion in France. The lower house of the French parliament has approved government plans to ban fake abortion information websites which masquerade as neutral, official sites with   helpline numbers but which the government said promote   propaganda and pressure women not to terminate pregnancies. The womenâ€™s minister, Laurence Rossignol, told parliament on Thursday that   groups in France were setting up sites â€œthat appear neutral and objectiveâ€ and copy official government information sites but were â€œdeliberately seeking to trick womenâ€. She said these sites often had helplines run by â€œ  activists with no training who want to make women feel guilty and discourage them from seeking an abortion. â€  Angelique Chrisafis  A Burmese friend recently put it like this: in the old days, people went to the tea shop to get their news. Now, they go to Facebook. After decades of isolation under successive military regimes, Myanmarâ€™s 51 million people began to come online rapidly in 2014 after telecoms reforms. They leapfrogged the era of   and desktops, starting with mobile phones and social media. For many, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. With scores of voices clamoring to be heard for the first time, itâ€™s a dynamic, sometimes dangerous space. As well as â€œ#foreveraloneâ€ statuses and a barrage of updates from staunchly   media organizations, news feeds are crammed with fake content. Much of it is tinged with religious hatred. With tensions between the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim populations running high, many are ready to believe vitriolic nonsense about Islam and its followers, often propagated by nationalist accounts set up for the purpose. A Muslim journalist was recently the victim of a campaign by some of these accounts, when a widely followed nationalist posted pictures of him juxtaposed with images of an unknown Rohingya Muslim militant. The post claimed he was involved in attacks on border police and called for his immediate arrest.  Nothing happened  â€”   the post was eventually taken down, though not before more than 3, 000 people shared it. But the episode was a hint of the frightening power that fake news can have in a context like Myanmar. Poppy McPherson, In Italy, the spread of propaganda has become such a worry for the government that a top official in prime minister Matteo Renziâ€™s circle of advisers recently filed a defamation complaint against a mystery Twitter account  â€”   it has since disappeared  â€”   who tweeted under the name â€œBeatrice di Maioâ€ and routinely took aim at Renziâ€™s government. In one example, the Twitter account showed a picture of Elena Boschi, the reform minister, on the phone. It suggested she was sharing insider information with her father, who was a top executive at Banca Etruria, a Tuscan bank. The bank was rescued by the Italian government in 2015 but there is no evidence that Boschi helped her father or committed wrongdoing.  In Italy the attacks against Renzi have been stepped up ahead of the critical 4 December referendum. In some cases, news about Italy reported by Russian   website RT Today has been especially skewed against the prime minister. In one case highlighted by La Stampa, the Italian daily, the Russian website falsely claimed that a rally in Rome held by supporters of Renzi ahead of the referendum were actually his opponents. The story has since been removed.  Members of Renziâ€™s Democratic party have complained that â€œ â€ websites controlled by the   Five Star Movement, which abhors traditional political advertising, are to blame for spreading false and defamatory news about the governmentâ€™s activities.  Stephanie Kirchgaessner, As reports emerged that fake news had influenced the US presidential election, China trumpeted its system of a â€œinternet managementâ€ portraying freedom of speech as broken when it can affect the outcome of an election. â€œChina is on its way to strengthening internet management,â€ said an editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid affiliated with the Communist party mouthpiece Peopleâ€™s Daily. â€œThe western democratic system appears to be unable to addressâ€ the problems and conflict unleashed by the internet, the paper added. The fake news that spread on Facebook in the   to the election even spread to China. Articles originally posted on   websites, including Breitbart, were directly translated into Chinese and shared on the countryâ€™s social media platforms.  Problems with fake news and fraudulent reporters have existed for over a decade in China, with people often presenting themselves as journalists and threatening companies with negative coverage in an attempt to extort money. In one   case, a journalist was paid more than $70, 000 to write negative stories about a construction equipment manufacturing company, sending its shares tumbling. But the authorities have seized on the phenomenon as a justification to censor a   of content. In 2013, the government launched a crackdown on online â€œ â€ targeting influential users on the   website Sina Weibo, but it was widely seen as an attempt to stem criticism of the ruling Communist party. More recently, Chinese authorities have clamped down on â€œfake newsâ€ they feel harms social cohesiveness, targeting â€œrumoursâ€ that affected property prices in Shanghai or stories the government says increase antagonism between urban and rural residents.  Earlier this year Chinaâ€™s cyberspace administration issued new rules designed to curb the number of stories using information culled from social media, stating â€œit is forbidden to use hearsay to create news or use conjecture and imagination to distort the factsâ€. News outlets cannot use information posted on social media without prior approval, it said. More recently a top official at the administration suggested there should be a database to identify internet usersâ€™ true identities so they could be â€œrewarded and punishedâ€. China maintains extensive control over the internet and many foreign websites, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube, are all blocked by a government program known as â€œthe Great Firewallâ€.  The countryâ€™s vast censorship system that imposes media blackouts on topics ranging from missteps by Chinaâ€™s leadership to investigating corruption cases. A recent directive banned websites from live streaming coverage of the US election. Benjamin Haas, Brazil has a growing problem with fake news and its importance has grown as political opinion polarized following the close   victory of leftist president Dilma Rousseff in 2014 and her controversial impeachment in August this year. According to a BBC Brasil report from April 2016, as the impeachment process that Rousseff and her supporters called a politically motivated coup began heating up, three out of the five most shared news stories on Facebook were false.  A story shared by the Pensa Brasil (Think Brasil) site that falsely said that federal police wanted to know why Rousseff had given 30bn reais ($9bn) to the giant meat company Friboi came third in the ranking with 90, 150 shares.  Last year Brazilian journalist Tai Nalon left her job at the Folha de S Paulo, one of Brazilâ€™s leading newspapers, to found the site Aos Fatos (To The Facts)  â€”   Brazilâ€™s first   site. â€œThere is a lot of false news,â€ Nalon said in an email interview, â€œbut I would be cautious about saying the problem is similar to what happens in the USAâ€. Instead, she said there are politically motivated pages that reinterpret and distort existing stories from big news outlets and that much of what they share is more biased opinion than pure falsehood. But plenty of false stories do circulate on Brazilâ€™s garrulous internet. The   investigation into the Petrobras scandal, called Operation Car Wash, was a key driver in Rousseffâ€™s impeachment. Although she has never been accused of graft, many in her party have been and the scandal prompted huge street demonstrations calling for her removal. BuzzFeed Brasil this month published this story about how more false news about the operation has been published than real. This year, the 10 most popular false news stories about Car Wash were shared 3. 9m times, BuzzFeed said, citing Facebook data. The 10 most popular real stories were shared 2. 7m times. Dominic Phillips, Fake news is not a problem of any scale in Australia: the media market, dominated by a handful of key players serving a population of just over 21 million people, does not seem fragmented enough. But Australia is not immune to issues with untruths spreading on Facebook. Over half the population (13. 3 million as at end of June) is connected to the internet of that number, more than half is believed to be active on Facebook. Some issues seem to be more of a lightning rod for untruths in Australia than others. The link between the halal certification industry and terrorism  â€”   repeated by politicians despite a lack of evidence  â€”   was so persistent that an inquiry was held late last year. Concerns over halal certification  â€”   often failing to completely mask rampant Islamophobia  â€”   flourished on Facebook, even after the inquiry found there was no basis to the connection. The Boycott Halal in Australia group has close to 100, 000 members on Facebook. In November 2014, it shared a satirical news article, apparently under the impression it was true. The post was subsequently deleted, but the page is a hotbed for views that have no basis in fact, as is the page for supporters of the Q Society, which bills itself as â€œAustraliaâ€™s leading   movementâ€. Pauline Hanson, a fringe figure in rightwing politics who is outspoken against Islam, was   to the senate in the federal election in July with support that surprised many pundits. Her One Nation party took four seats in the   senate this year and the party is expected to do well in the Queensland state elections. Parallels have been drawn between her return to politics and Trumpâ€™s election: both have embraced social media, where they have significant followings, and are similarly unfazed by evidence. In August, research showed 62% of voters agreed with the statement: â€œI might not personally agree with everything she says but she is speaking for a lot of ordinary Australians. â€ She is active on Facebook, as are many of her supporters. She recently announced that the majority of her press releases would be released only on Twitter.  Elle Hunt, After Indiaâ€™s prime minister announced the introduction of a new,   note last month, phones around the country lit up with the news the bill would come installed with a surveillance chip, linked to a satellite that could track the notes even 120 metres underground. The claims, debunked by the countryâ€™s reserve bank, nonetheless spread like fire over Whatsapp  â€”   which has more than 50 million users in India  â€”   and migrated into mainstream news. As in the United States and elsewhere, increasing numbers of Indians are getting their news from social media.  But the   episode illustrates the deeper impact of fake news in a country where media is prolific, but journalistic standards, especially in regional media, can still fall short.  â€œMainstream media in India is more impacted by the phenomena [of fake news] because they broadcast these kinds of stories without verifying,â€ says Prabhakar Kumar, from the Indian media research agency, CMS. â€œThere is no standard policy for TV news and newspapers about the process of researching and publishing stories. â€ Police have arrested people accused of concocting false stories, especially when they run the risk of igniting communal tension. Administrators of Whatsapp groups have been warned they could be held responsible for the messages they oversee.  But social media has only enabled a much older reliance on rumour and innuendo, especially in Indiaâ€™s villages. Two boys in Dadri village, near Delhi, didnâ€™t need Whatsapp last year to spread rumours a local man was storing beef in his freezer. They broadcast from the loudspeaker at the village temple.

It seems impossible that someone who has influenced comedy like he has would have never received a   moment like that. Then again, Chappelle made himself scarce in the years after walking away from his massive hit series Chappelleâ€™s Show. Plus, SNL  â€”   though the launching pad for Eddie Murphyâ€™s meteoric rise to superstardom  â€”   has rarely been amenable to the talents of black comedians. That Chappelle is choosing this as his major comeback vehicle (and bringing A Tribe Called Quest along with him) is significant, especially at a time when itâ€™s fair to wonder where black comedy is headed in the second half of the decade. Iâ€™ve seen Dave Chappelle perform live twice: at the height of Chappelleâ€™s Showâ€™s success at a   theater in Fresno, California, and this year, in Los Angeles, on the eve of the Academy awards. The latter show took place inside a Latin dance club near Echo Park. We were made to hand over our cellphones so as not to spoil a raucous evening that included guest appearances by Oscar host Chris Rock (testing out material for his Oscar hosting gig) and Christopher â€œKidâ€ Reid from Kid â€˜n Play. That Fresno show was tight, controlled and traditional. The LA show included a running gag about orgasming, lots of cigarettes and the occasional blunt. It was a    monologue that would be familiar to anyone whoâ€™s seen Chappelle live in the past few years  â€”   as if   Lenny Bruce didnâ€™t have to fight against censorship and could just get high on stage and ramble. That formless, meandering style lends itself to glib, controversial rhetoric like his recent comments on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the Cutting Room in New York. He called Trump â€œthe most gangsta candidate everâ€ and while acknowledging that he voted for Clinton, said that â€œsheâ€™s not right, and we all know sheâ€™s not rightâ€. Chappelleâ€™s canonical status as a comic allows him these sorts of indulgences and I canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t enjoy myself, but I canâ€™t help but yearn for the focused, hungry Chappelle who I worshipped as a young adult. As an awkward biracial kid in a small town, Chappelle was the first black comic I could relate to. He straddled the line between worlds in a way that even Eddie Murphy couldnâ€™t. Chappelle was vulnerable before white comics like Louis CK and Marc Maron made that cool, and well before black standups like Hannibal Buress and W Kamau Bell could get away with it. But he was never patronizing or disinterested in his own blackness the way Bill Cosby could be. Historically, black comedy has been about bravado, about decibel levels, and about playing to the crowd  â€”   Murphyâ€™s swagger in Raw and Delirious, Richard Pryorâ€™s bare emotional intensity and confidence, Redd Foxxâ€™s bawdy misanthropy, and Bernie Macâ€™s grumpy old man ferocity. Itâ€™s a tradition typified by Def Comedy Jam, the Russell Simmons institution thatâ€™s returning to TV this weekend, the same night that Chappelle hosts SNL. The special, All Def Comedy, is a revival of sorts for the Def Comedy brand and a spinoff of a digital series produced by Simmonsâ€™s All Def Digital   brand. Looking at the lineup it seems that black comedy hasnâ€™t changed much since Chappelle went home. All Def is hosted by Chris Rockâ€™s brother Tony, a fixture at LAâ€™s Laugh Factory and the   MC for shows like this. Tony also hosted the   Showtime at the Apollo revival, Apollo Live on BET. A glance at some of the YouTube clips of the listed performers reveals common themes that run through the history of black standup: the inscrutability of black women, infidelity, the great mysteries of the bowel movement and the trials and tribulations of being broke. The supremely confident, strong black comic is personified today by people like Kevin Hart, arguably the biggest comedy star in the country today  â€”   at least in terms of his ability to consistently draw fans to movie theaters, football stadiums and various home media devices. Thereâ€™s certainly   in Hartâ€™s work: his persona is that of someone who projects authority and   but constantly subverts that image. Itâ€™s a deft modernization of the black comic standard. Thereâ€™s also SNL cast member Leslie Jones, who derives many of her laughs from her booming voice and unshakeable belief in herself, a character trait that became invaluable during her recent struggles with Twitter trolls and the  . But that was never Chappelle. From the conceptual absurdity of his   baby bit to the laconic stoner humor of   Chappelle never seemed to embrace the theatrics of Rock or Murphy (and their descendent, Hart). His crackly voice and lanky frame didnâ€™t lend themselves to the gravitas of those people. His tendency to crack up or appear mystified by his own jokes (signified by a habit of slapping his microphone on his thigh) was endearing, not intimidating. His inviting,   persona might have opened the door for the complicated response to Chappelleâ€™s Show that drove him away from the spotlight. A recent piece in The Fader by Amos Barshad looked back at the sketch that pushed Chappelle away  â€”   a racially charged bit of satire that a white audience member enjoyed way too much for his liking. Without the air of menace, the sex appeal, or authority that Rock, Murphy, Pryor, Foxx and others brought to their work, Chappelle might have made the jokes we all tell ourselves in the barber shops or basketball courts acceptable to white folks  â€”   putting black pain on a Hot Topic  . That he walked away says more about his intelligence and keen sense of empathy than anything else in his body of work. He couldnâ€™t stand to profit from work he didnâ€™t believe in, which is not necessarily true of many of his peers in black comedy. After all, Robert Townsend directed BAPS and Bill Bellamy was in whatever this was supposed to be. The influence of Chappelle is felt in comics such as Buress, the Lucas Brothers, Wyatt Cenac, Eric Andre and others  â€”   acts that donâ€™t struggle to appeal to white audiences and donâ€™t really fit in the baroque Def Jam mold. Black comedy today is seeing the same sort of divide between   and club comics that fundamentally altered the white comic landscape in the 1990s and 2000s. Chappelle could do both and based on the diverse makeup of the tiny club show I saw, he still can. The thing is, the Def Jam comic will always be a necessary part of the black cultural experience. He or she is a conduit for our frustrations, an avatar of strength in the face of rampant prejudice, and a keen observer of a world most people donâ€™t understand. Theyâ€™re also, to borrow a phrase, for us and by us in a society dominated by whiteness as status quo. Chappelle might have retreated from the siren song of the mainstream because they didnâ€™t really understand him (or even care to) but hopefully what we will see on Saturday night is a reminder of how he got so close in the first place.",915,97,"996787146349596672	997102305685143552",fake

The Airbus A320 flight MS804 from Paris to Cairo disappeared from radar screens between the Greek island of Crete and the north coast of Egypt on 19 May.   people were on board. A vast search operation was launched, finding debris and pieces of the planeâ€™s fuselage at the bottom of the Mediterranean, before the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered last week. The   investigative committee began examining the black boxes on Saturday in the presence of representatives from France and the United States, where the engine was made, said Egyptâ€™s civil aviation authority. Both of the devices were damaged and had to be raised from the seabed in several stages, said the authority. Their memory units were removed at the civil aviation ministryâ€™s labs in Cairo and were undergoing testing, it said. The data on them is to be unloaded, before it is analysed in a procedure that is expected to last several weeks. If badly damaged, the black boxes would be sent abroad for repairs, otherwise the work could be done in Egypt. Investigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the plane to crash, although a terror attack has not been ruled out. Franceâ€™s aviation safety agency has said the aircraft transmitted automated messages indicating smoke in the cabin and a fault in the flight control unit minutes before it disappeared. On Monday, Egyptian investigators confirmed the aircraft had made a   left turn followed by a   turn to the right before hitting the sea. The passengers on the plane were 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians, and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. They included a boy and two babies. Seven crew and three security personnel were also on board.

politifact15190,http://time.com/5161034/florida-school-shooting-survivor/,Student Hasn't Stopped Filming Since Florida School Shooting,"A    landscape painting once valued at $10m and signed â€œPete Doigeâ€ was not made by the artist Peter Doig, a Chicago federal court ruled on Tuesday. Doig had been sued by a former Canadian corrections officer who claimed the artist was falsely denying that he had made the work. The unusual authentication lawsuit was filed in 2013 after the Scottish artist refused to authenticate the painting when the former corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, and art dealer Peter Bartlow tried to sell it. It required Doig to prove he hadnâ€™t painted the work. â€œI feel a living artist should be the one who gets to say yea or nay and not be taken to task and forced to go back 40 years in time. It was painstaking to piece this together,â€ he said during the ruling, according to the New York Times. Fletcher claimed he and Doig had met at Lakehead University in the 1970s. In 1976, he said he bought the work for $100 from the artist while he was incarcerated at the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre, where Fletcher worked. He said he watched Doig paint the desert landscape, fell in love with it, and purchased it to stop the young man, who had been incarcerated on an LSD charge, from going back to selling drugs. Years later, a friend noticed the painting and suggested that it could have been created by Doig, according to Fletcherâ€™s lawsuit. From there, Fletcher began working with Bartlow, who owns an art gallery in Chicago and is now a   in the case. In the trial, Fletcher and Bartlow attempted to show similarities between the painting and Doigâ€™s other works as evidence. They also claimed his denial was the product of embarrassment over the incarceration or past drug use. Doig, however, said he had never attended the university and had never been incarcerated, citing his school yearbook, his motherâ€™s letters about his whereabouts  â€”   including his role in Romeo and Juliet in high school  â€”   and written testimony from friends as evidence, the New York Times reported. He wrote in court papers that he hadnâ€™t begun to paint on canvas until late 1979. â€œIf I had painted that painting when I was 16, I would admit it,â€ he wrote. Born in Edinburgh in 1959, Doig lived in Trinidad with his family before moving with them to Canada in 1966. He studied art in London on and off between 1979 and 1990. His magical landscape paintings have earned millions  â€”   last year, Swamped, a painting of a moonlit white canoe, sold at action for nearly $26m. Fletcher and Bartlow sought $5m in damages and a declaration that the painting was authentic, since its sale was likely to earn them millions, based on recent sales of Doigâ€™s work. The artistâ€™s lawyers said they identified the real Pete Doige, whose records matched Fletcherâ€™s description. Doige died in 2012, but his sister, Marilyn Doige Bovard, testified at the trial that the work was created by her late brother. In a written statement after the verdict, Doig said of the   trial that â€œjustice prevailed, but it was way too long in comingâ€ according to the BBC. â€œThat a living artist has to defend the authorship of his own work should never have come to pass. â€ A lawyer for the plaintiffs has not yet decided whether they will appeal the decision.",657,831,"964258282356568064	964262629672869888	964265707071406080	964267807973224452	964270278107975680	964271213790023682	964276182228324353	964277025560199168	964277424585261056	964280438469595137	964285783220858880	964294040979197954	964294066488963072	964302875793932288	964312834711617536	964322465106182144	964359760714678275	964359823075586050	964364251656732674	964364257365143557	964369390970925058	964370761828847616	964381514665361408	964388123986685952	964409230907207680	964411188464435201	964556279002947585	964556385622089729	964573099072122880	964595497192316928	964643559977693185	964687156055760896	964724339118628866	964784219036815360	964787253410193408	964854951628496899	964897234469998594	964929963261661184	964953346082791424	965254651405840384	966696631751118848	966870757140811776	979025182382788609",fake
politifact13751,https://web.archive.org/web/20170310140734/http://www.learnprogress.org/trump-caught-investing-pipeline/,BREAKING: Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It,"  delicatessens and diners are disappearing so fast in New York that the imminent loss of one of the cityâ€™s most notable,   eateries is being publicly mourned by another that could ordinarily be considered an arch rival. The Carnegie Deli in midtown Manhattan, a legendary business in the city and just steps away from the renowned, eponymous concert hall after which it is named, will serve its last pastrami on rye on New Yearâ€™s Eve, after more than 80 years. As regulars and tourists lined up in high emotion for hours this week to savor one last bowl of matzo ball soup or helping of latkes, the young boss of its downtown fellow icon, Katzâ€™s Deli, has marked its imminent loss. â€œThe Carnegie Deli will shut its doors for the last time on December 31 and we New Yorkers have already started mourning,â€ wrote Jake Dell in a letter to the New York Times published on Thursday. Dell owns the internationally renowned Katzâ€™s in Manhattanâ€™s Lower East Side neighborhood. The corner establishment is almost 120 years old and famous for its signs exhorting wartime families to â€œsend a salami to your boy in the armyâ€ its cameo in the film When Harry Met Sally, a confusing ticketing system and epic Jewish food staples served in   surroundings. â€œI am deeply saddened to witness the disappearance of a fellow culinary landmark,â€ Dell wrote about the Carnegie Deli. A little younger than Katzâ€™s, the Carnegie has long drawn the theater crowd to its spot on Seventh Avenue, not far from Times Square, where paneled walls in   dining areas are crowded with signed pictures of the stars who have enjoyed its overstuffed reuben sandwiches or slices of brisket over the years. â€œDeli is about brining   â€¦     patience   â€¦     preservation, not just of meat but of tradition,â€ Dell wrote. The nearby Stage Deli preceded Carnegie out of Midtown four years ago when it closed, and the classic Second Avenue Deli left its old East Village spot a decade ago. Meanwhile, vintage American diners are also departing the city relentlessly and now number in the couple of hundreds where they used to exceed a thousand, and the traditional neon shop signs that brighten the nights in â€œthe city that never sleepsâ€ are disappearing along with them. The Carnegie Deli had experienced a   variety of financial hurdles in recent times, from a pay dispute to a safety crackdown and even a contentious divorce among the ownership. But Katzâ€™s Dell also pointed out that while businesses cherish the bustle of New York City, they also â€œagonize over the nonstop gentrification when we lose too many of our classics   â€¦     as we wistfully watch yet another great legend fall by the waysideâ€. Celebrated chef Anthony Bourdain lists Katzâ€™s and the classic smoked fish and bagel emporium, Russ  Daughters, nearby on Houston Street, among his favorite city eateries. So Dell had a promise on Thursday â€œto deli lovers the world overâ€: he plans to open another branch in Brooklyn this spring and the original business is continuing to expand its delivery and mail order services, in addition to packing them in around the plain tables for pickles and pastrami from breakfast time to the wee hours. â€œKatzâ€™s is not going anywhere,â€ he wrote.

politifact14840,http://inshapetoday.com/now-official-fda-announced-vaccines-causing-autism/,FDA Announced That Vaccines Are Causing Autism,"Taxes on sugary drinks had a banner year in the US, with six new laws passed across the US. But advocates for the preventive health measures are warning that the Trump administration could threaten or even reverse momentum. â€œI think there is going to be some battles to be fought to maintain ground and not lose ground,â€ said David Goldberg, a spokesperson for Healthy Food America (HFA) a key supporter of these taxes. In October, the World Health Organization urged all nations to consider a sugary drink tax to curb obesity, cut health care costs and increase revenue for health services. WHO has found that a 20% increase in price led to fewer people consuming sugary drinks. It said taxes would have the greatest positive impact on the young and people with low incomes. Sugary drink tax success in the US has followed momentum internationally. Several countries have introduced the taxes in recent years, including Mexico, which introduced the tax in January 2014 and the UK, which is set to introduce its sugary drink tax in 2018. When 2016 started, Berkeley, California was the only US jurisdiction with a sugary drink tax, which passed in 2014. But this year, Americans voted by referendum to institute the taxes in four cities, and city officials passed taxes in two other metropolitan areas: Philadelphia and Cook County, Illinois  â€”   a 5. 2 million person jurisdiction that includes Chicago. Now, sugary drink tax supporters see the US federal government as a threat to these developments.    Donald Trump campaigned against lobbyists, but his transition team included Michael Torrey, a lobbyist who runs a firm that helps the main soda lobby, the American Beverage Association. Torrey was tasked with helping set up the Department of Agriculture team, according to the New York Times. And in early December, Trump named fast food executive Andy Puzder as head of the labor department.  â€œWe just have to be vigilant and try to protect gains that have been made in recent years,â€ Goldberg said. â€œBut meanwhile, regardless of what the lobbyists are doing at the federal level, we think local communities will keep making progressâ€.  New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle, author of Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning) said progress on soda taxes has been outstanding, but it was difficult to predict how Trump and a   Congress would act towards public health initiatives.  â€œNobody seems very interested in public health in the group thatâ€™s coming in, but we have to wait and see  â€”   it doesnâ€™t look promising,â€ she said. â€œIf I were   Iâ€™d be in Congress right nowâ€. The beverage industry, for its part, said the success of sugar tax laws has been exaggerated.  â€œThe   advocates are going to areas that are more predisposed to taxes and I just donâ€™t see taxes sweeping the middle of the country and people in the middle of the country wanting more government intervention,â€ said Lauren Kane, an American Beverage Association spokeswoman.  She noted that the taxes won by popular vote in some of the healthiest cities in the country: Boulder, Colorado and San Francisco.  But that skepticism has not stopped the industry from spending millions of dollars to combat these local laws. The 2016 sugar tax votes were some of the most expensive ballot measures nationwide, with the American Beverage Association, spending $38m to try and defeat the measures.   tax campaigns, meanwhile, were backed by billionaire donors such as Laura and John Arnold, whose foundation donates to HFA, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who donated nearly $20m to efforts in Californiaâ€™s Bay Area.  The taxes are also being introduced after decades of falling soda sales as consumers move away from sugary drinks in favor of healthier options.  â€œThe reality is that they [the beverage industry] are facing a public that understands the increased health risks from sugar drinks and they are facing local policy makers and local community advocates who know what their communities need,â€ said Jim Oâ€™Hara, the director of health promotion policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a   that supports sugar taxes. Oâ€™Hara said local needs would outweigh national political debates about these local health laws.  â€œMr Trump will be the president of the United States,â€ Oâ€™Hara said. â€œHeâ€™s not going to be the mayor or governor in cities or states across the countyâ€.

politifact14556,http://www.breakingnews247.net/59b9b0078dc69/carnival-cruise-lines-will-now-offer-free-cruises.html,Carnival Cruise Lines will now offer FREE Cruises,"Saturday nightâ€™s bombing on 23rd Street in New York brought questions of experience and temperament to the fore in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, after the Republican seized on the explosion to argue the US is in peril. At a campaign rally in Colorado on Saturday night, Trump declared the explosion to have been caused by a bomb, hours before police voiced any public conclusions. â€œJust before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly whatâ€™s going on,â€ Trump said. The Trump campaign has not said whether the businessman received information privately from New York officials or was speculating without evidence. In contrast, Clinton did what most officials do after an uncertain and dangerous incident: urge caution and patience for conclusions from police. â€œI think itâ€™s important to know the facts about any incident like this,â€ she told reporters on her campaign plane. â€œThatâ€™s why itâ€™s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen.  â€œI think itâ€™s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened. â€ Two hours after Trumpâ€™s remarks, New York mayor Bill de Blasio described the bombing, which injured 29 people, as â€œan intentional actâ€. But De Blasio, NYPD commissioner James Oâ€™Neill and Governor Andrew Cuomo all stressed on Sunday that they have not found evidence so far of any link to international terrorism and are considering any suspect and motive. On Sunday afternoon, Clinton called the bombing one of three â€œapparent terrorist attacksâ€ alongside pending investigations into pipe bombs in New Jersey and a mass stabbing in Minnesota. The FBI is investigating the stabbing as a â€œpotential terrorist attackâ€ police have ascribed no motive or suspect to the pipe bombs, which officials said on Sunday had not been established to be linked to the New York explosion. â€œI pray for all of those who were wounded, and for their families,â€ Clinton said in a statement. â€œOnce again, we saw the bravery of our first responders who run toward danger to help others. Their quick actions saved lives. â€ Clinton then reiterated her outline for an   plan, including an â€œintelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacksâ€ and â€œwork with Silicon Valley to counter propagandaâ€. Both Clinton and Trumpâ€™s proposals largely mirror the   priorities of Barack Obama, who has waged a bombing campaign abroad and authorized extensive surveillance online. Tim Kaine, the Democratic   candidate, argued that his running mate has   experience in such crises. â€œHillary Clinton was New York senator on   and was there at the World Trade Centers,â€ he told NBCâ€™s Meet the Press. â€œThey were still looking for survivors. And sheâ€™s been through this. Itâ€™s been a searing experience in her life. And she was part of the national security team that worked together to revive the hunt and wipe out [Osama] bin Laden. â€œAnd so it is an important time where you have to have experience. â€ Asked if the threat of violence, whether through bombings, mass shootings or terror, was â€œa new normalâ€ Kaine said: â€œI donâ€™t accept that. We donâ€™t know yet about the cause of these incidents. But weâ€™re not allowing it to be a normal. â€ Kaine also spoke of the US campaign against Islamic State, although the terror group has not claimed responsibility for the explosion. â€œThe challenge is, as Isis realizes that theyâ€™re losing ground, then they see whether they can exploit weaknesses elsewhere,â€ he said. On Sunday Trump only acknowledged the bombing only with a tweet, writing: â€œI would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC. â€ His ally Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was markedly more cautious than the Republican nominee when asked about the bombing on Sunday. A pipe bomb exploded in the New Jersey town of Seaside on Saturday, and though police say they have found no connection between that explosion and New Yorkâ€™s, they were investigating any possible link. â€œWe donâ€™t believe at this time that there is evidence connecting it to the attacks in New York or Minnesota,â€ Christie told CNN, referring to a stabbing at a mall in St Cloud in which eight people were wounded and the suspect, who reportedly made reference to Allah, was shot dead. â€œWe have some promising leads, but no suspects at this time. â€ â€œYou donâ€™t want to jump to conclusions,â€ he added. â€œAnd you donâ€™t want to put information out there that you donâ€™t know is absolutely true. â€ But despite this admonition Christie defended Trumpâ€™s decision to describe the explosion as a bombing long before there was any evidence to do so.  â€œI think that what Donald did was perfectly appropriate to tell that group in Colorado Springs that a bomb had exploded,â€ Christie said.  â€œI donâ€™t think you have to defer when saying that there was an explosion and a bomb in New York. I mean, everybody knew that. It was being reported on television. â€ Most news networks were careful to say that police did not know the cause of the explosion at the time. Throughout his campaign, Trump has spoken of America in almost dystopian terms, describing it  â€”   often with false or misleading statements  â€”   as a â€œdivided crime sceneâ€ where refugees are a â€œTrojan horseâ€ for terrorism, police are endangered and murder and unemployment on the rise.  He has also reacted in unpredictable ways in the aftermath of horrific events, for instance after the mass shooting in Orlando in June, when he thanked people  for â€œthe congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorismâ€. Christie echoed Trumpâ€™s dark vision of the US on Sunday, and blamed Clinton and Barack Obama for it.  â€œItâ€™s because of her type of leadership over the last eight years,â€ he said, â€œalong with the president, that the world is a much more dangerous place. â€ Clinton contrasted that message in her own statement, saying: â€œAmericans have faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger. I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear. â€",601,587,"2282869256	2284261150	2861432406	13926100954	13927159301	13930775661	13991569378	14032845983	14453900633	14515432034	14533068865	21750782017671168	22259229897269248	23667989438009344	23669116388773888	23854554890113025	25351543981080577	26427408861110273	26427469154226176	53266711658508289	53483774779981824	53844843868327937	54108363314831360	54754183974371328	55146994842341376	55178261134712832	55539891341246464	55562479073366016	58710684355133443	61679074292142080	62338520601198593	62518997278670848	62929709230600192	86917146818510848	161881423563862016	297045712854720512	297695265975046144	301696009128534016	301696348753895425	301731611316207616	302280165755588608	325365279020425217	347926777261330433	377119292925304834	377119294951141377	377125868813828097	377137750408826881	378204130395029504	378470712425852928	410827098647846912	425400340934979584	425402380772192256	425402390540341248	448859201268625408	448913726792814592	449299737100189696	450067960951209984	453596109982949376	453596280133283840	457172502276349954	475640149376655360	523087193305542656	958349818144935936	958489095046680577",fake

After all, the elder Bush president is a moderate from the   who has in recent years developed a close relationship with the Clintons. His old patrician sensibility is reportedly offended by Trumpâ€™s vulgar style. And letâ€™s not forget Bush witnessed Trump ruthlessly and gleefully eviscerate his son Jeb during the Republican primary, often in the most personal of ways, and delve into conspiracy theories to attack the presidential legacy of another son, George W. This is not to say that Bush voting for Clinton is a   altogether. When is the last time a former Republican president not only refused to endorse the presidential nominee of their own party but allowed it to get out they were actually voting for the opposition partyâ€™s presidential candidate? Off the top of my head, I canâ€™t think of any parallel in recent American history.  But if you forget for a moment that George HW Bush was once was a Republican president, he is not all that different from the type of Republicans who have crossed party lines in past elections to endorse the Democratic nominee. (Think Colin Powell in 2008 and 2012.) To understand why this story is more remarkable than notable Republicans crossing party lines to support, say, Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, you have to take a look of the full scope of   Republicans who have refused to endorse Trump, if not declared they will be voting for Clinton. Yes, you have the squishy   Republicans such as Bush, Maine senator Susan Collins and former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman. But you also have staunch movement conservatives like Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, Washington Post columnist George Will and radio host Erick Erickson not getting aboard the Trump train. Now, unlike Bush Sr, this latter group is probably far less likely to let it be known they support Clinton over Trump. But unlike in 2008 and 2012, there are bulwarks of the conservative movement refusing to get behind the Republican presidential nominee, not just those easily dismissed as Rinos (   ). Thatâ€™s no small thing. It is true that as the election draws nearer, some   Never Trump conservatives have come around to supporting Trump. Conservative talkshow host Mark Levin is perhaps the most famous example. But many more Never Trumpers seem to be in it for the long haul, even in the face of conservatives who argue that they have to vote for Trump at the very least to prevent Clintonâ€™s supreme court nominees. But itâ€™s not only significant   politicians, activists and opinion columnists who are refusing to support Trump. The most famous conservative academics are refusing to get behind him as well, including conservative and libertarian legal scholars  â€”   exactly the kind of people who understand how important the supreme court is. For instance, you have Princeton professor Robert P George, perhaps the most noted intellectual defender of social conservatism in the country, refusing to back Trump, even as he says he canâ€™t back Clinton either. The same goes with some of the top conservative economists, such as Harvardâ€™s Greg Mankiw. In fact, the Wall Street Journal reached out to 45 past economists who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under both Republican and Democratic administrations and not one responded to say they were supporting Trump. You can make fun of these people as egghead elitists, but the reality is most have fought the intellectual conservative fight in the most liberal of environments their entire lives. These are are not squishy moderates. They are true believers in conservative principles. So it may be easy to dismiss George HW Bushâ€™s putative decision to vote for Clinton (his spokesman refuses to confirm or deny the report). But when you look at the scope of figures  â€”   from Republican establishment politicians to leaders of the conservative movement to members of the conservative intelligentsia  â€”   who still refuse to get on the Trump train and likely never will, it is hard to conclude anything other than there is something truly repellent about the current Republican presidential nominee  â€”   and something deeply awry with a conservative movement that could nominate him.

Michael Quinn, 33, an IVF geneticist from Melbourne, was caught in May in LA in a sting set up by US authorities who posed as paedophiles and a pimp offering to supply him with a    boy to rape for $US250 ($A330). Quinn, who played for the Melbourne Chargers, wept throughout his sentencing and claimed it was the first time he had attempted to prey on a child. â€œIf you give me a second chance I wonâ€™t let you down,â€ he told US district court judge John Walter. Quinnâ€™s lawyer had asked for 10 years. Walter sentenced Quinn to the term prosecutors had asked for. The veteran judge described Australianâ€™s desire to attend what Quinn believed was a paedophile party at an LA hotel room and pay a pimp to allow him to rape a young boy as â€œabsolutely disgustingâ€ â€œghastlyâ€ and â€œdespicableâ€. The party was a sting set up by undercover US authorities who had been communicating with Quinn online for several weeks in Melbourne before he departed on a rugby trip to the US with some of his Chargers  . â€œAussie perv, heading to the US late   interested to meet others while Iâ€™m there. LA, Nashville, NYC,â€ Quinn posted on a social media site used by paedophiles. A US undercover agent saw the post and began communicating with Quinn. The geneticist told him of his wish to rape a boy and authorities set up the sting for when he arrived in LA in May. Quinn claimed that he had never molested a child the sting was the first opportunity offered him. His lawyer, Lisa Shinar LaBarre, said Quinnâ€™s severe addiction to methamphetamine had altered his thinking and created psychotic thoughts. Quinn had also claimed to have been abused as a child. The court heard that a psychologist who examined Quinn in jail concluded it was unlikely he would reoffend. The judge said he was not â€œoverly impressedâ€ by the doctorâ€™s report, noting that Quinn had not undergone standard testing for pedophilia. â€œIt upsets me so much that I could be capable of harming a child,â€ Quinn, dressed in a white prison jumpsuit, told the judge. He also apologised to Australia for â€œdamaging its reputationâ€ and told the court: â€œI never want to put a child in danger again. â€ Judge Walter said he did not â€œbuyâ€ the cause and effect of Quinnâ€™s drug addiction and the abuse he suffered as a child. â€œThe defendant had every intention of raping a boy,â€ the judge said. The   â€™s ankles were shackled.

Do you support to deport them?,"Barack Obama has defended free trade and condemned â€œcrude populismâ€ in what is in effect an open letter to his successor in the White House. Writing in the Economist, the president does not mention Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump by name but makes clear that he disagrees with both candidatesâ€™ opposition to the   Partnership (TPP). Obama sets out a vision for Americaâ€™s future based on boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, providing meaningful work opportunities and shoring up the economy against financial storms. In what the Economist describes as â€œa trenchant, unapologetically centrist essayâ€ entitled â€œThe Way Aheadâ€ Obama, who leaves office in January, acknowledges that an anxiety over globalisation had taken hold in the US, not unlike the discontent leading to Britainâ€™s vote in June to leave the European Union. At home and abroad, he writes, people ask him: â€œWhy have some on the far left and even more on the far right embraced a crude populism that promises a return to a past that is not possible to restore  â€”   and that, for most Americans, never existed at all?â€ Obama offers what he believes is a reality check: â€œThe world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease. So we have a choice  â€”   retreat into old,   economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top. â€  In an election year characterised by a wave of   sentiment from Trump and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders, Obama contends that globalisation has been by far a net positive for the American economy. â€œLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade,â€ Obama contends. â€œWhile some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers. â€ Clinton has joined Trump and Sanders in speaking out against the TPP, although some analysts suspect that, should she win the presidency, she will seek to repackage the deal in a manner that allows her to approve it. Obama pledges to keep pushing for Congress to pass the TPP because, he says, it will level the playing field for workers and businesses. In an obvious swipe at Trump, Obama writes of the current air of discontent: â€œThe       and   sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past  â€”   the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the   of the   the   sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again. â€ But he acknowledges that some of the unrest is rooted in â€œlegitimate concernsâ€ about decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality resulting in slower income growth for   and   families. The financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites. â€œSo itâ€™s no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known. â€ Clinton is attempting a broad church election campaign that embraces some ideas from Sanders, a   socialist, but also has the centrist Obama as a leading surrogate. During an electrifying primary campaign, Sanders argued for the breakup of the Wall Street banks. But the president urges against quick fix solutions.  â€œFurther progress requires recognising that Americaâ€™s economy is an enormously complicated mechanism,â€ he writes. â€œAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract  â€”   breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports  â€”   the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people. â€ Obama does, however, devote a section of the essay to widening inequality  â€”   a key theme of Sanders and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren  â€”   and its negative economic and moral consequences. In 1979, he says, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all   income by 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%. â€œThis challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We donâ€™t begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, weâ€™ve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better. â€ He cites technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage as factors in growing inequality. â€œBut I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels  â€”   at church, at their childrenâ€™s schools, in civic organisations. â€œThatâ€™s why CEOs took home about 20 to 30 times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why todayâ€™s CEO is now paid over 250 times more. â€ He urges the next occupant of the White House: â€œIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the   rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition. â€ He also calls for increasing the federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children and limiting tax breaks for   households. Obama further notes that in 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the workforce. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of   women were out of the workforce. Today, it is 26%. â€œInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction,   physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among    Americans  â€”   the group where   participation has fallen most precipitously. â€ Obama proposes increasing access to community colleges and providing wage insurance to those workers who cannot find a job that pays as well as their previous one. He says paid leave and guaranteed sick leave would also encourage flexibility that could lead to more people working.  Championing the achievements of his   presidency, led by preventing the 2008 financial crisis from turning into a great depression, Obama says a foundation was laid for a better future. He suggests that the US should prepare for negative shocks to the economy before they occur and not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need. â€œAmerica must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,â€ he writes.

The Porter Airlines Bombardier Q400   plane, which took off from Ottawa, was at 9, 000ft (2, 750 meters) descending into the cityâ€™s Billy Bishop waterfront airport, when the pilots saw an unmanned aerial vehicle.  â€œTwo crew members performed an evasive maneuver to avoid the unidentified object,â€ said Genevieve Corbin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). Corbin said the object was most likely a drone. Two cabin crew suffered slight injuries during the incident, Porter said.  â€œThe pilotsâ€™ initial assessment was that it looked like a balloon. After debriefing, there is potential that the object was a drone,â€ said Porter Airlines spokesman Brad Cicero.   The plane landed at about 7. 30am ET (12. 30 GMT). The TSB has now launched an investigation, the first time it has done so for such an incident, said Corbin.   In June, Canadaâ€™s federal transport ministry launched a campaign intended to deter people from flying drones near airports or aircraft.   There have been a rash of   between planes and unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States in recent years.   In April, police in Britain said a British Airways passenger aircraft collided with what was most likely a drone as it prepared to land at Londonâ€™s Heathrow airport. The aircraft landed safely and no injuries were reported in the incident.

On Monday the company began advertising for a head of news partnerships with â€œ20+ years of experience in news, with strong   and understanding across the businessâ€. The requirement means those applying must have started their news career before Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had celebrated his 13th birthday. The applicant will also be expected to be the â€œ  voice of Facebook and its role in the news ecosystemâ€ and â€œa strong voice within Facebook on the goals and priorities of news publishersâ€. The company already has a director of global media partnerships, Andy Mitchell, who has a background on the business side of news organisations, mainly with CNN. It has also employed former journalists in less senior roles. But the latest job ad suggests the company is looking for someone to address concerns raised by media organisations, politicians and others about the social networkâ€™s wider impact. Fake news stories concerning the US election, in particular favouring Donald Trump, have been blamed by some for influencing voters and has pushed Facebookâ€™s role into the spotlight.  The company has also come under scrutiny for removing the famous photograph of a girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam war, manually editing its trending results, and attracting the lionâ€™s share of mobile advertising revenues which many media organisations are competing for. The wording of the head of news job posting stops far short of suggesting Facebook is looking for someone to explicitly operate as an editor, something many in the industry have suggested is necessary but that the company has vigorously resisted. Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied that fake news on Facebook could have influenced the results of the US election, and while he has said the company would take steps to tackle the problem, he has warned that it should not be â€œarbiters of truth ourselvesâ€. His staff have reportedly taken a more robust approach, allegedly forming a taskforce to tackle the problem.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

So dominant has Isis become in the realm of jihadist lore, that you could be forgiven for thinking that its precursor has been relegated to a mere footnote. Youâ€™d be wrong. Those three deaths, all in US airstrikes, paradoxically hint at a resurgence of   at a time when Isis is in retreat in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Quietly, and more through soft power rather than harsh atrocity,   is trying to mount a revival.  The Pentagon said that at least one of the three leaders killed, Haydar Kirkan, a   veteran of the group, had been actively planning attacks against the west at the time of his death. This is a controversial claim as   founded in 1988, has in recent years foresworn such   operations in favour of a strategy privileging a slow and steady building of influence and capability at a local level within the Islamic world.  In part, this decision  â€”   taken by Ayman   the leader of   shortly after he succeeded the late Osama bin Laden in 2011  â€”   was forced on the group by its weakness after years of being targeted by the US and allies in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001.  But more recently it has been a deliberate attempt to distance it from Isis, which has been responsible for directly organised strikes in France, Belgium, Germany and Tunisia, among others, and  â€”   through   â€œlone wolvesâ€  â€”   in the US.    and its affiliates have deliberately shunned the savagery of Isis, seeking to build support across the Islamic world through outreach to tribal leaders, power brokers and sometimes the broader community, rather than outright fear and coercion.  The group does not seek publicity. â€œ â€™s strategic experience is that if it makes a big deal of seizing territory, it attracts CT [ ] resources, so it is simply not being as loud about it,â€ said Daveed   an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, a US thinktank. The three locations of the US strikes two months ago are significant. Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria are all key strategic zones where Isis has either failed to make significant advances or, in the latter case, is on the retreat.  In January 2015, Isis formally announced the establishment of what it called Khorasan province in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The move, coupled with an attempt to expand in Bangladesh, signified a push to branch out into south Asia and win recruits among the more than 400 million Muslims in the region. But the militants have had little success. â€œDespite its best efforts   â€¦     the Islamic State controls little territory in south Asia, [has] conducted only a handful of attacks, failed to secure the support of most locals, and struggled with poor leadership,â€ wrote Seth Jones, a former adviser to US forces in Afghanistan, this month. A major obstacle to the expansion of Isis in the region has been the opposition of most local militant groups, notably the Taliban.    which has preserved a close relationship with the Taliban and some other militant groups, is still present in Afghanistan. In October 2015, US and Afghan forces attacked a huge training compound in the south of the country, killing more than 200 militants. The camp was used by   in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) an affiliate established in 2014. South Asian officials point out that AQIS has so far failed to carry out any significant attacks or attract large numbers of recruits. However, that   had survived at all in the region was â€œimpressiveâ€ one said.  â€œThereâ€™s been constant pressure on the group, and particularly its leadership element, for 15 years, and theyâ€™re still there. The death of   is a blow, but theyâ€™ve suffered worse and still come back,â€ said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Another key battlefield has been Yemen, where, in perhaps the most striking unintended consequence of the   military intervention in the country,   was able to run a   on Yemenâ€™s coast for many months.  The substantial and strategically situated port city of Mukalla provided the group with a revenue of an estimated $2m a day. A 2015 US government report estimated that   in the Arabian peninsula (AQAP) the   affiliate, could muster at least 4, 000 fighters, four times the total a year previously. The group has also built ties with southern Yemenis, who have felt marginalised by the countryâ€™s northern elite for years. â€œWe may be facing a more complicated   not just a terrorist organisation, but a movement controlling territory with happy people inside it,â€ said a regional diplomat who follows Yemen.     has also successfully expanded its presence in Africa. The violence and brutality associated with the   Boko Haram group, which has now split over its nominal allegiance to Isis, and the Isis expansion into Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, have overshadowed the less spectacular but arguably more effective efforts made by   affiliates on the continent.  In Somalia, commanders of the   movement ruthlessly eliminated   factions that wanted to repudiate the groupâ€™s    allegiance to  . A last dissident group is currently under siege from Somali forces in the far north of Somalia, in   Puntland, and facing annihilation.  In the Sahel, although one new faction has emerged to launch attacks in the name of Isis, it is the coalition of factions that form   in the Maghreb (AQIM) that is dominant.   AQIM has exploited deep ties  â€”   some through marriage  â€”   with local communities and levered ethnic disputes to gain support and capabilities in Mali, a key state that French and other international forces have been unable to rid of extremists. â€œ  is on a trajectory to become by far the most powerful jihadist movement in Africa,â€ said  .  The most significant theatre may well turn out to be the Levant. Though most analysts believe Isis will remain a powerful  â€”   even if fragmented  â€”   force in the region for years to come,   may be the biggest winner.  The key to its strategy has been the   group now called Jabhat Fateh   (JFS). Formerly known as   Front, the powerful faction was rebranded in late July as a force without links to the global jihadi struggle but dedicated only to fighting Bashar  â€™s regime and its allies.  In recent years,   has repeatedly attempted to downplay its links to local groups to avoid alienating communities which do not want to be part of a â€œglobal jihadâ€ but which hope Islamic hardliners might impose order and honest, if rigorous, administration in areas they control.   Western officials fear JFS will not only dominate the jihadi landscape in the Levant following the defeat of Isis, but may also provide a springboard for   to launch strikes into Europe, should the group change its current strategy. Zawahiri has made it clear that although the group may have prioritised local campaigns for the moment, it still remains committed to attacks on the west in the long term. â€œAs the Islamic State continues to lose territory and as the international coalition continues targeted airstrikes, we are likely to see another name in the headlines more often: Jabhat Fateh â€ said Matthew Henman, of Janeâ€™s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. Hoffman described JFS as â€œeven more capable than the Islamic State and a more dangerous   threatâ€.",672,340,"759906153807515649	760167230952865793	760229724702420992	848481908241477637	848502555290116096",fake

The extent of their raucous boozing and debauchery is being carefully catalogued inside the newly opened Nan A Rothschild Research Center, a repository in midtown Manhattan housing over one million archaeological artifacts from New York Cityâ€™s past. On a recent Thursday morning, Amanda Sutphin, the director of archaeology for the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission, sorted through some of her favorite City Hall party relics. She picked up a smooth, cylindrical object the size of stubby Cuban cigar. â€œTake a look at this douche,â€ said Sutphin, who is tall, with glasses and a short brown bob. â€œItâ€™s made of cow bone though, so it might have felt a bit rough. â€  The park behind City Hall, which was built in 1812, is by far the repositoryâ€™s largest haul  â€”   the city has collected over 400 boxes of artifacts from the site. A lot of them seem to be liquor bottles. â€œWhenever someone important would come to the city  â€”   like, say, Marquis de Lafayette  â€”   they would always throw a giant party. â€ Sutphin paused, still holding the douche. â€œBut Iâ€™m not saying this douche was found at Lafayetteâ€™s party!â€ The douche was uncovered in 2011, and caused enough of a stir that it was featured on a Saturday Night Live skit some years ago. â€œIt was just like, â€˜They found a douche behind City Hall, ooooo  â€¦    â€ A pause. â€œI never said it was funny. â€  Originally, no one could work out what it was  â€”   the archaeologist who found it thought it was a pepper grinder. â€œBut you can see here,â€  â€”   Sutphin unscrewed the top  â€”   â€œitâ€™s got a little plunger. And on the ends you can see the small holes. â€ It probably belonged to a young woman from the middle class  â€”   a more    society lady would have had a glass douche. â€œFor a smoother experience,â€ Sutphin said. Some women even used theirs as contraception, although, as Sutphin noted, â€œProbably wasnâ€™t very effective. â€ The repository is a small,   room in the basement of a Durst Organization building on West 47th Street. There are about 1, 5000 cardboard boxes  â€”   â€œarchival boxesâ€ is the technical term  â€”   filled with artifacts from 14 sites across the five boroughs, stacked neatly on white shelves. There are a lot of ceramics from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, remnants of the Revolutionary war (bayonets and buttons made by soldiers when it was too cold to go outside) and a lot of evidence of what people used to eat: bones  â€”   both cow and dog  â€”   and oysters as large as saucepans. This is because New York harbor in the 18th century was home to one of the largest oyster beds in the world the street carts that now sell hotdogs used to sell oysters in all varieties: raw, pickled, fried. â€œHaving an oyster back then would have been like having a nice steak,â€ Sutphin said.  Sutphin studied at Barnard College and has been with the Commission for 20 years. Her job is to review development projects happening throughout the city and figure out if there are any potential archaeological treasures to be found. â€œYou need to have a good grasp on the cityâ€™s history, particularly things like knowing where the early settlements were, what was farmland and what wasnâ€™t  â€”   and most importantly, where people dumped their trash. â€ The most common archaeological sites in the city are 19th century privies  â€”   toilets, in other words. Before New York City had public water, people used outhouses, with a separate cistern to store water. When public water was introduced, people began filling their outhouses with household trash. For Sutphin, colonial lavatories are about as exciting as it gets. â€œItâ€™s a time capsule of what that period is like. Sometimes you find incredible things: peopleâ€™s old dishes, their secret liquor stash. â€ Sutphinâ€™s job is rare: only a handful of other major US cities have archaeology programs, Boston and DC among them. â€œA lot of people think itâ€™s like Indiana Jones,â€ Sutphin said, somewhat annoyed. â€œItâ€™s not about finding some cool thing from the past that has magic powers  â€”   itâ€™s trying to recreate a puzzle of what the past was like. â€  Next to the City Hall party items, Sutphin had assembled a selection of the collectionâ€™s quirkier items: burned coffee beans  â€”   â€œCoffee was as important in the 19th century as it is now. Everyone drank it because the water was kind of shit back thenâ€  â€”   a femur from a passenger pigeon, which once ruled the skies above New York before being hunted into extinction some 100 years ago  â€”   â€œThey had bright, pretty feathers so everyone wanted someâ€  â€”   and a tea cup set belonging to the Van Cortlands, a wealthy family from the Bronx. Coincidentally, some of the items in the repository were until very recently stored inside the womenâ€™s restroom in Van Cortland park. â€œI do not know why or how the decision was made to store the collections there  â€”   but it was made many years ago and I think clearly shows the need for the repository both as a climate controlled facility and as a place that is managed by people who understand the importance of the collections,â€ Sutphin said. The only item in the collection associated with a particular individual is a wine jug seal belonging to Benjamin Fletcher, who was governor of New York from 1692 to 1697. (It was normal for wealthy people to send their own fancy glass jugs to taverns to be filled with wine.) Fletcher was a notorious lover of pirates, to the point where he allowed them safe passage in New York and as a result, was swiftly fired from his post and sent back to London, where he faced charges of conspiracy and bribery. â€œHe was a naughty boy,â€ Sutphin conceded. Although the repository is only open to researches and scholars, the Commission recently launched an online digital archive, where anyone can view images of the collection and read up on each artifactâ€™s backstory. Admittedly, these descriptions arenâ€™t very imaginative. â€œNuremberg single wire spectacles, small pieces of copper alloy wire tying the circular loops closed, probably Klemmerâ€™s clip, glass lenses missing. â€ In real life, the spectacles look like theyâ€™ve seen better days. Sutphin pulled them out of their box to show me. â€œI donâ€™t know how effective these would have been  â€”   maybe more effective than the douche?â€  She started to laugh, but stopped abruptly. â€œBut seriously,â€ she said, leaning in closer. â€œThe more stories we understand about our city the more people are represented, the richer we all are. Itâ€™s very much an   Trump view. â€",205,381,"876944556251648001	877019285142601728	877021968666697728	877140582233239552	877453710959542272	877478191832674305	877608988929646592	877666355692130305	883227443951259648",fake

The game had begun under a barely concealed layer of concern over strikes and security fears, exacerbated by news of skirmishes involving England fans in Marseille, but Didier Deschampsâ€™s young France team eventually achieved   with a   victory over a dogged Romania. Afterwards, Payet said he had felt â€œa lot of stress, a lot of pressureâ€. â€œIf someone had told me it would have gone like that I wouldnâ€™t have believed it,â€ added the West Ham United forward. On the approach to the national stadium in   which was the target for three suicide bombers almost exactly seven months ago amid terrorist attacks on the capital that killed 130 people, home fans draped tricolors around their shoulders and donned novelty chicken hats, but the usual celebratory air was undercut by a mix of defiance and trepidation. Yet once inside, 75, 000 noisy fans waved thousands of French flags and a sizeable Romanian contingent responded in kind, forming a bold block of yellow at one end, as they tried to focus on the fact that a football tournament featuring 24 teams playing 51 matches across 10 stadiums was about to break out. All the accoutrements of a modern major sporting event were present and correct  â€”   the sponsorsâ€™ branding, the all but   stands, the painted faces and the garish wigs  â€”   but there was also an impatience to get under way and park the concerns of the buildup. Each new European Championship brings with it inflation  â€”   this time in its expansion to 24 teams and 2. 5 million fans  â€”   and that extended to the opening ceremony last night. DJ David Guetta, who the previous night had played a free concert for 80, 000 people under the Eiffel Tower, provided the music. French patrol planes flew overhead, 144   dancers in dresses emblazoned with the French flag cavorted around the pitch, an Eiffel Tower banner was unfurled and a 7. 5 sq km French garden overlay were all employed to try to create a party atmosphere in stark contrast to the ring of steel outside. But earlier, at least one metro train was evacuated as a precaution and the stadium was cleared in   to allow police with sniffer dogs to sweep through before the arrival of the French president, FranÃ§ois Hollande. He had also been present on the night of the attacks in November when France faced Germany, and it was when he left his seat in the VIP area that night that many of those present in the stadium knew something serious had happened. A huge security operation is under way across the country, with 90, 000 police, army and security staff responding to the heightened threat level. A security force of at least 13, 000 is on duty in the capital alone. Organisers had pleaded with fans to arrive up to three hours before   opening the gates early and promising entertainment within the stadiums, but strikes that have frustrated ministers and left rubbish piling up in central Paris also affected trains to the Stade de France. When the action on the pitch finally started, a swashbuckling France took the game to Romania but failed to puncture their gutsy defence before   as the crowd began again to get edgy.  Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud gave the hosts the lead shortly before the hour mark but Romania levelled from the penalty spot, before Payet stepped up to arrow his shot into the top corner and prompted a lusty rendition of the La Marseillaise, sung as much in relief as in triumph.",61,733,"832424799720837120	832428434349502464	832429510679105536	832432836250628096	832437975883665409	832445676751556608	832449534785581056	832451032437387265	832456561591144449	832459302036074496	832476806947090432	832481616219869186	832482641114914816	832487251342864384	832497100474638336	832497211208380418	832530144673816576	832566196302131202	832578384316211201	832583259443695618	832585217122635778	832594182506168322	832594245387243524	832594258414669824	832733104804540416	832752833145368580	832776435400060928	832776561149435904	832784366346571776	832817083750703105	832821802959257600	832826238247063552	832911521978134528	833081649650733056	833340130421153792	833361927531229184	833424427413098496	833844457476853760	947210389464510468	947211211212550149	947211728735166465	947212264238649351	947212512583327744	947219074194530304	947225763647856640	947267221767802881	947526902473986048	949335427596636160",fake
politifact14063,http://rip.trendolizer.com/2017/04/breaking-conservative-icon-ted-nugent-killed-in-hunting-accident-1.html,BREAKING: Conservative Icon Ted Nugent Killed In Hunting Accident,"It was a bedraggled summer afternoon more than a decade ago. I was strolling down the street with my two young daughters. Lucy, the preschooler, was whirling around ahead of me, seemingly determined to fall on her face, while Beatrice, the baby, was squirming and giving me back strain in the baby carrier. I had not experienced a solid five hours of sleep in months. I had mastitis, so I was wearing cabbage leaves in my bra. Because I lived in a beautiful, gentrifying neighborhood that was still populated with a sprinkling of wise   I daily had some stranger approach me and sagely advise, â€œEnjoy it now. It goes by so fast. â€  But on this day, as I nodded gently in fake gratitude to the tip, I made a promise to myself. Iâ€™ll try to enjoy it, I thought. And I will never, ever say that to another parent. I will remember that it doesnâ€™t go by so fast when youâ€™ve been up since 4:30. I will remember that not all of this is very enjoyable at all. Now, that daredevil preschooler is a    high school junior with a packed social schedule. The baby who kept me up nights is a middle schooler who could, if   were an Olympic event, be a gold medalist. Sometimes I look at them and wistfully realize that they will never again fall asleep in my lap as I read them Goodnight Moon. I will never hear them hilariously mispronounce â€œelevatorâ€ or â€œambulanceâ€. I will not push them on swings, or feed them applesauce as we watch Sesame Street together. That door is closed.  I feel remarkably OK about that. Exhausted, overwhelmed parents of young children, let me assure you that, yes, this time in your childrenâ€™s lives is precious and beautiful and intimate and full of magic and discovery. But no, you do not need anybody to chide you into appreciating it. Iâ€™m sure you already do. Iâ€™m also sure you sometimes canâ€™t even imagine a barefoot walk across the living room floor that doesnâ€™t end in a   howl of pain. Iâ€™m sure the last five movies you saw involved talking animals. Iâ€™m sure the idea of a trip to the bathroom for yourself with nobody banging on the other side of the door sounds like a vacation in a four star hotel.  Well guess what? That uninterrupted bathroom break will come. And it wonâ€™t be sad. Itâ€™ll be awesome.  Recently, a friend came in from out of town for business, and do you know what we did? We met up for drinks. At 4pm. My purse has zero Cheerio dust in it. I havenâ€™t heard the Kidz Bop version of a contemporary pop song in a good three years. Sometimes, on the weekend, I sleep past 8am.  It helps very much that I happen to think my daughters have grown up to be pretty great people. They donâ€™t need me to tie their shoes, but they can make dinner. They donâ€™t make me pipe cleaner art, but they can talk about politics and movies and books theyâ€™ve read. They are interesting, engaged young women I like as individuals as much as I love them as my flesh and blood. That cuddly puppy phase of their lives was uniquely sweet, but seeing smart, independent young people launching into the world? Thatâ€™s sweet too. I think when people get inordinately nostalgic for their childrenâ€™s youths, theyâ€™re really being nostalgic for their own. Iâ€™d be lying if I said I didnâ€™t miss that young mom version of myself, the one with fewer lines on her face and flawless eyesight. I know that I associate my girlsâ€™ babyhood with a period of my own life, before a marital crisis and two bouts of cancer and the death of my best friend.  But I also remember how grateful I was when a friendâ€™s parent lovingly told me, when my kids were little: â€œThese are hard years. â€ So I try to hang on to the truth of that time, of what it was like when I couldnâ€™t just take a shower when I wanted, when an     tantrum could mean a child lying prone in the middle of the supermarket, making a spectacular scene. Sometimes when I see another parent whose kid is losing it in public, I just want to go over and reassure: â€œIt gets better. â€  There are so many joys of having older children, and of being older oneself. Believe it. Donâ€™t let anybody arrogantly make you feel like youâ€™re not stopping to smell the roses enough when youâ€™ve spent your day wiping noses instead. Iâ€™m here from your future, to tell you that it hasnâ€™t gone by too fast. It hasnâ€™t gone by at all. The story is still being told. And every chapter holds its own wonders.

politifact15401,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/14/politics/melania-trump-surgery/index.html,Melania Trump undergoes kidney surgery at Walter Reed medical center,"Donald Trump has long held that Hillary Clinton is stealing the election. But on Tuesday he suggested something even darker and more sinister: that his supporters resolve the issue with guns. Specifically, he suggested that using the constitutional right to bear arms may be the only way to stop Clinton from appointing supreme court justices should she win in November. â€œIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,â€ Trump said, before adding: â€œAlthough the second amendment people  â€”   maybe there is, I donâ€™t know. â€ Whether Trump was suggesting his supporters use their weaponry against Clinton herself or any liberal judges she might go on to appoint is somewhat open to interpretation. Most people are reading it as the former, but either way itâ€™s unacceptable and a violation of what it means to live in a free democracy. This is a new low even for Trump, whoâ€™s been accused of inciting general violence and has verbally attacked individuals from Khizr Khan to Rosie Oâ€™Donnell. But heâ€™s never seemed to incite it against individuals  â€”   until now. Gabby Giffords drove home that point and the pernicious effect those words could have on the unstable, in a statement released Tuesday. â€œWe must draw a bright red line between political speech and suggestions of violence,â€ she said. â€œResponsible, stable individuals wonâ€™t take Trumpâ€™s rhetoric to its literal end, but his words may provide a magnet for those seeking infamy. They may provide inspiration or permission for those bent on bloodshed. â€ Those words have special meaning coming from Giffords, whose time in political office was cut short by an assassination attempt that left six dead she survived but with a critical gunshot wound to the head. Now Trump is pulling the tricks he always does when he says something beyond the pale politically. Heâ€™s blaming the media for getting it wrong. Before when heâ€™s implicitly encouraged or used the language of violence  â€”   at rallies when heâ€™s told supporters if they punch a protester heâ€™ll pay the legal bills, or at campaign stops when heâ€™s boasted murder wouldnâ€™t drive his supporters away  â€”   heâ€™s walked it back as just another quirky part of his humor. â€œObviously it was a joke,â€ he later said of the murder brag. Trumpâ€™s already spinning this newest threat, saying he meant that second amendment supporters could still stop Clintonâ€™s election  â€”   by voting, sillies! But that line, like much of his campaign rhetoric, is pure bullshit. While thereâ€™s some wiggle room in other parts of his statement whatâ€™s not up for debate is that he was talking about Clintonâ€™s powers after the election, if she wins  â€”   â€œif she gets to pick her judgesâ€. You canâ€™t stop someone from winning democratically if theyâ€™ve already won a democratic election  â€”   you have to do it criminally, and specifically, according to the rest of Trumpâ€™s quote, using â€œthe second amendmentâ€. Iâ€™ve no doubt that itâ€™s an unequivocal call for the use of gun violence to upend democracy and one for which Trump should not be given the benefit of the doubt. Even more stunning than any of Trumpâ€™s stunningly unpresidential behavior is that not every Republican has run straight for the hills. He even had backup from that Republican mainstay organization known as the National Rifle Association, which tweeted its support for his initial statement even as it altered its meaning by claiming Trump said if Clinton gets to pick supreme court judges, â€œthereâ€™s nothing we can do. â€ This is not party politics as usual. This goes beyond mere polarization or the other ills of Washington. Itâ€™s an attack on democracy thatâ€™s as personal as it is politically vile. Trump was talking in thinly veiled terms about the most personal kind of attack there is  â€”   an attack on the body and specifically, an attack on the body of the first female president.  The gendered element of it isnâ€™t lost on party leaders. Elizabeth Warren didnâ€™t mince words on Twitter this evening, saying Donald Trumpâ€œmakes death threats because heâ€™s a pathetic coward who canâ€™t handle the fact that heâ€™s losing to a girl. â€ Rebecca Traister has written brilliantly on the long history of powerful men like Trump who would delegitimize the ascent of women and minorities. But this  â€”   to have the nominee of a major party appear to encourage his supporters to assassinate his opponent  â€”   is unlike anything weâ€™ve seen before, quite likely for the simple reason that weâ€™ve never had a woman this close to the White House steps. Just as the birther movement that Trump helped lead was thinly veiled racism rooted in the belief that a black man couldnâ€™t possibly legitimately be the president, Trumpâ€™s insistence that â€œcrooked Hillaryâ€ has â€œstolenâ€ the election thrives among those who are angry that power could be taken from them by a woman, and specifically this one.

politifact15383,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/04/flash-24-daily/no-sandra-bullock-didnt-disparage-hillary-clinton/,"No, Sandra Bullock didn't disparage Hillary Clinton","Rhonda Covington is short on time. As the only public defender for the 20th judicial district of Louisiana, she has a lot to take care of. At any given moment, she could be investigating cases, calling witnesses, scouring through evidence, taking photos at crime scenes (with her own camera) meeting with her clientsâ€™ families, writing motions, typing up pleadings, making appointments, answering the phones, answering the door, getting the mail at the post office, filling in timesheets, filing monthly reports, doing the accounting, paying the rent and utilities, cleaning the bathroom, dusting the furniture, sweeping and mopping the floors, taking out the trash, trimming the bushes, unclogging the plumbing, buying the toilet paper, or meeting with everyone arrested in a    area just north of Baton Rouge, within 72 hours of their arrest. â€œThere are days,â€ she says, â€œwhen I feel that I could literally scream to the top of my lungs for 10 minutes. â€ Every Wednesday, she makes an   trip to the infamous Angola prison to meet with clients.  Every other night, she visits inmates at the local jail.  Every weekend, she works. She also appears in court almost daily, where she handles all types of cases  â€”   juvenile and adult, misdemeanor and felony. Earlier this year, following what Governor John Bel Edwardsâ€™s office called â€œthe largest budget crisis in our stateâ€™s historyâ€ the Louisiana public defense system spiraled into fiscal ruin. Public defenders who had long depended on a highly unstable source of funding  â€”   traffic tickets  â€”   now saw their revenues slashed further. Soon, many districts were finding makeshift ways of getting by  â€”   including Caddo Parish, which conscripted tax attorneys, real estate attorneys and other novice recruits from the private bar to fill in for the overwhelmed defenders. But in other towns, public defense offices have been left to fend for themselves. Stripped of   attorneys, investigators, translators, social workers and support staff, they are now little more than ragtag,   squads. In the 16th judicial district, for example, a single public defender stands by as groups of up to 50 mostly black, poor defendants are convicted of and sentenced for major felonies  â€”   all at once, all together  â€”   in a few hours or less. And in the 20th district, exactly one woman, Covington, is employed   to represent poor people accused of crimes. Because her district initially received only $34, 086 in assistance from the state last year to run a public defenderâ€™s office that covers more than 900 cases across two parishes, East Feliciana and West Feliciana, Covington has been forced to cut just about everything but herself. She recently dismissed an attorney (savings: $38, 400 a year) reduced her secretary to   ($7, 194 a year) canceled the officeâ€™s cellphone plan ($1, 829. 28) and discontinued housekeeping services ($2, 400). She saves another $1, 000 a year by having an inmate work crew mow the yard outside her office.  Covington, whose clients call her â€œMs Rhondaâ€ wears a medical boot on her right foot because she tore a ligament a few months ago while running to the courthouse. She no longer has any health insurance, let alone workerâ€™s compensation, for the injury. She gets help around the office from two contract lawyers who chip in two days a week, and a makeshift office corps of two   $   paralegals and an intern during the summer. There are also her â€œoffice managersâ€: two cats, named Liberty and Justice. For All died a long time ago. On a Monday in June, Covington is frantically prepping copies of the docket for her next session in court. She can usually be found with a giant Sonic cup of Diet Coke in the crook of one arm (â€œIâ€™m addicted,â€ she says) and a handful of files in the other.  Her intern, Jimmy Zahorchak, is helping out for now by August, he will have gone back to law school at Louisiana State University. â€œOne summer of help, thatâ€™s all I get,â€ she says. â€œI can only pay him $10 an hour anyhow, so Iâ€™ll probably lose him to the DAâ€™s office. â€ Zahorchak is making copies of motions for her to sign while the phone is ringing off the hook.  â€œPublic defenderâ€™s office,â€ Covington answers. â€œHey dear, how are you? Would you hold, please?â€ She brings a second phone to her other ear. â€œPublic defenderâ€™s office, Rhonda speaking   â€¦     Oh, youâ€™re Ericâ€™s mother? His next trial date is 3 October,â€ she says from memory. Covington pours another Diet Coke, using her shoulders to keep the two phones pressed against her ears. A client comes through the door, explaining that his boss accused him of stealing a tractor, but he was just using it for side work, and  â€”   â€œHold on, Mr Brand, Iâ€™ll be right with you, donâ€™t go anywhere!â€ On the phone, she says: â€œWould you please tell them that even if you donâ€™t think those police interviews are important, I still want to hear them? Thank you, maâ€™am, I appreciate it. â€ Turning again to the client in her office, she asks: â€œNow, Mr Brand, what can I do for you?â€ Within an hour Covington is making her way to court, where she has to quickly help a few defendants take pleas before driving to West Feliciana Parish to grab some files at the courthouse there, after which she has to stop to pick up the mail. Then she is headed to the jail back in East Feliciana Parish to visit a new client named Mario Adams, who she thinks might be locked up on the wrong burglary warrant. â€œIt just doesnâ€™t feel right,â€ she says, pointing out that Adams is from Mississippi and that the police have no evidence he was even in East Feliciana at the time of the burglary. â€œI have to check it out. â€ Finally, a few minutes into that drive, while passing an inmate work crew on the left, Covington has a moment to lament how rushed she felt back in the courtroom. â€œThe clients insist on your full, undivided attention,â€ she says. â€œBut without any money, without any help, you just canâ€™t do it   â€¦     I shouldnâ€™t complain. I should save my complaining for my cases. â€ Covington says her father hates her criminal defense work. â€œEvery time he reads in the newspaper about some terrible crime somewhere, he calls me up and says: â€˜See, Rhonda, see, see? !â€™ The attitude of a lot of people in Louisiana is: â€˜If theyâ€™ve been arrested, then by damn   â€¦    â€™â€ Her response is always the same. â€œI just donâ€™t think it should be easy to take away somebodyâ€™s liberty. It shouldnâ€™t be cheap to take away someoneâ€™s liberty. â€ The district attorneyâ€™s office in Covingtonâ€™s district, after all, handles a similar caseload but with about $1m more in its budget. She used to be able to afford a translator, but now, whenever she has a   client, she has to rely on a police officer to translate their private discussions  â€”   which, she says, is a conflict for obvious reasons. She also had a case a few years ago in which a handwriting expert saved her client from going to jail, but she definitely would not be able to afford that now. When Covington gets to the jail, she is greeted by a chorus of â€œHeya there, Ms Rhonda!â€ She walks past a long, white board with the names of almost a hundred inmates scribbled on it. Most of them are her clients. Fifteen poor, black men shuffle into a courtroom together in southern Louisianaâ€™s Cajun country, dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles.  As they file into the jury box  â€”   which today is serving as the â€œplea boxâ€  â€”   their chains jingle against the old, hardwood floor. Here in the 16th judicial district, at the St Martinville courthouse, it is â€œfelony plea dayâ€ with Judge Gregory Aucoin presiding. Many of these defendants have not discussed their cases with their public defender yet, and they will have about 30 seconds to speak with him this morning. Then the judge, with a cigar dangling from his mouth, will ask: â€œAre you satisfied with the advice your attorney has given you in this matter?â€  â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir,â€ they will all say, down the row. â€œOK, I accept your plea agreement. â€ And just like that, with no time for arguments to be heard in each of their cases, they will have all pleaded guilty together, and will be headed to prison for years, sometimes decades. Last year, the 16th districtâ€™s public defenderâ€™s office was forced to cut $311, 000 from an already skeletal budget of about $1. 5m. As a result, they offered increasingly cursory assistance at these mass hearings, in which up to 50 defendants are collectively marched into a courtroom then convicted and sentenced to major felony charges carrying up to life in prison. â€œMass pleasâ€ of this sort are not unheard of in Louisiana and elsewhere in the country, especially in states with chronic public defender problems, including Pennsylvania, Utah, Michigan and Missouri. Usually, however, it is a process reserved for much smaller groups of defendants, especially in misdemeanor cases, while major felonies involving the possibility of significant prison time receive more individualized attention. As the hearing in St Martinville begins, the only defender in the courtroom, Gary LeGros, glances at the long list of people he is representing. Wearing a small hoop earring and a suit that hangs over his hands, he calls out to the defendants in the pews, who, unlike those in the plea box, were able to pay bail and came to court freely: â€œEveryone here whoâ€™s represented by the public defenderâ€™s office, please come up and print your name on this sheet!â€ LeGros holds up a legal pad, and over a dozen people stream forward. He then gives their names to an assistant, who rummages through several mammoth file boxes, looking for each case. One of the defendants, Brandon Washington, is facing burglary charges. He says he used to have a paid attorney but lost his job at a Halliburton factory and had to turn to the public defender. Several months after making that switch, he has no idea who his lawyer is and has never talked to him. â€œI think it may be that guy,â€ he says, referring to LeGros. LeGros soon makes his way into the jury box with the men in jumpsuits and chains. He asks for their names, calling back to his assistant to see if she has the relevant file. Then he gives each the option of making a deal, and if they say yes, he shouts over to the DA. â€œThat oneâ€™s a theft case, weâ€™ll do a deal,â€ shouts the DA. â€œOK,â€ says LeGros, after checking quickly with the defendant. â€œMr LeGros, whatâ€™s that one pleading?â€ â€œGuilty, I think. â€ As more deals are made across the room, there is little discussion of the nature of each case, or of the background and circumstances of each defendant. Every agreement is made in a matter of seconds, weighed and considered by each defendant for only a moment. Ultimately, no defendants will plead â€œnot guiltyâ€ today and go to trial.  In fact, of the 4, 492 felony cases in this district last year, there were only eight jury trials, and not because only eight people believed they were not guilty. The court schedule sets aside one week for trials every three months, and anyone who wants a trial has to wait, usually in jail, for one of those dates to come around. The public defenders, with no time to be more thorough, advise their clients that pleading is the surest, safest way to go. When everyone has been prepped for their â€œmass pleaâ€ a bank of white lawyers  â€”   defenders and prosecutors seated close together  â€”   face the panel of black defendants. The judge, Aucoin, starts reading off their pleas. He informs them of their rights, and in an instant, all are felons. LeGros turns to the defendantsâ€™ families, who have been watching from the front rows, and says: â€œWelcome to the criminal justice system. â€ If he had more funding, LeGros would spend more time doing â€œreal lawyer workâ€ as he puts it, instead of just processing his clients en masse. â€œI can pretty much keep track of all of them, and most cases donâ€™t require much attention,â€ he says by phone. â€œBut thereâ€™s no way all those boys understand whatâ€™s going on when they get their rights all together like that. I donâ€™t like it, but shit, Iâ€™m just a country lawyer. What you going to do?â€ Yet the group pleas are only partly the result of an underfunded public defenderâ€™s office, says Christopher Murell, a civil rights attorney in New Orleans and the executive director of the Promise of Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform organization. It is also about a courtroom culture  â€”   on the part of judges, DAs and public defenders alike  â€”   of trying to get all the cases processed expediently, without friction. The judges and DAs â€œget angry at you for not giving them a heads up that youâ€™re going to file a motion, because that will mess up their scheduleâ€ says Murell. â€œA fair trial is considered an interruption. â€ Cecelia â€œBeanieâ€ Bonin, is the chief public defender of the district (and Le Grosâ€™s boss). Her office is located adjacent to an   cemetery, in a   space that feels more like a basement. On a whiteboard at the back of one room, someone has listed a set of priorities: #1: How to go about getting the waitlist moving. #2: Review who needs an attorney. And further down the list, in all caps, #10: PROCEDURE FOR SANITY. When she took over the office in March 2015, Bonin thought she would begin by raising expectations. Her plan was to get control over the caseload, promote performance standards, and demand that her attorneys file more motions and have more meaningful conversations with their clients. She never considered that more than a year later, her attorneys would be watching helplessly during mass hearings like the one in St Martinville. But Bonin soon realized that when an office is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy, little else is possible. She could not afford enough attorneys to actually discuss pleas in advance, let alone develop relationships with defendants. Nor could she find good, experienced lawyers who would work for her in the first place, given how little she was able to pay them. The ones she already employed all needed to work two jobs to supplement their salaries, which begin at $34, 000 a year. One of Boninâ€™s lawyers had 345 active cases but was working only 15 hours a week. The rest of the time, she ran a private practice. In the 16th judicial district and across Louisiana, things have improved slightly for public defenders since July, when the state legislatureâ€™s new budget went into effect. Controversially, it slashed funding for the lawyers who represent defendants in death penalty cases, and shifted that money to the overwhelmed   defenders. Now, defendants facing the death penalty are finding themselves on waitlists for legal counsel.  Even with the shift in the budget, Rhonda Covington still labors alone, and the mass pleas have continued. One summer day in New Iberia, just down the road from St Martinville, Judge Thibodeaux turns toward a plea box of a dozen poor defendants. Smiling, he says to them: â€œYâ€™all just need to all commit the same crime next time, so we can do this faster. â€ A public defender goes over to them, learns their names, and makes a deal. Then the judge starts in,   them by reading off their rights. â€œDo you understand your right to a jury trial?â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir,â€ they all answer. â€œDo you understand your right to confront your accusers?â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œI canâ€™t hear you. Say, â€˜Yes, sir,â€™â€ the judge says to one defendant. â€œDo you understand that you have the right to counsel when the state proceeds against you?â€ The public defender is not paying attention. He is talking to the next batch of defendants, scribbling down their pleas.",571,98,"948939390482436096	948945870736695296	949334792914522113	950189081496965120",fake
politifact13820,thenationalmarijuananews.com/jimmy-carter-medical-marijuana-cured-my-cancer/,Jimmy Carter: “Medical Marijuana Cured My Cancer”,"As votes roll in across the pond, hereâ€™s a quick rundown of today in the American presidential campaign: Thatâ€™s it for tonight   keep your eyes on #Brexit! All eyes are on the UK tonight, for obvious reasons   including those of Hillary Clinton, although her interest is more, well, domestic in nature. The former secretary of stateâ€™s presidential campaign, in a bid to mock opponent Donald Trump as he makes a business trip to Scotland, has released a video emphasizing his widespread unpopularity in the UK. â€œDonald Trump has always been seen as something of a grotesque American curiosity,â€ a news anchor intones. â€œHis remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong,â€ David Cameron shouts. â€œDonald Trump is a fool,â€ mocks a member of Parliament. Donald Trump has released yet another fundraising email, this time with the subject line â€œLying Crooked Hillaryâ€: â€œHillary Clinton is a   liar. This much is a fact,â€ the email reads. â€œWe know we cannot count on the media to spread the very important message that Hillary Clinton is a liar and canâ€™t be trusted,â€ it continues, â€œAnd thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve decided to take that message directly to the American people. Weâ€™ve unveiled a brand new website, LyingCrookedHillary. com, and weâ€™re rolling out a series of videos  â€”   one on each of her biggest, phoniest fibs and fabrications. â€ The attached video, highlighting the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed four American lives, proclaims that â€œHillary has no shame!â€ Bernie Sanders, as he promised, addresses the rise of Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. â€œWe understand that Trump is so   I mean, itâ€™s hard almost to imagine   a man who has such limited capabilities becoming president,â€ Sanders says, sounding horrified. â€œWhat is even uglier is that you think about the struggles that we have gone through as a nation   the hundreds of years fighting against racism, fighting against sexism, and that this guy is making the cornerstone of his campaign bigotry!â€ Trump, Sanders says, â€œis insulting Mexicans and Latinos, insulting Muslims, insulting women, insulting African Americans . .. We have got to work tirelessly to make sure that Trump is not president   but that is not good enough! What we have got to do is to continue the vision of transforming this country. â€ â€œAnd most importantly, I know that we can do that, is for all of us to get involved in the political prrocess. We need great peopel on school boards on city councils,â€ Sanders says. â€œLet me just say: The struggle continues!â€ Sanders says, as David Bowieâ€™s Starman plays and he exits the stage after a   speech. If the theme of tonightâ€™s speech is â€œWhere We Go From Here,â€ itâ€™s fair to wonder, one hour into Bernie Sandersâ€™ address, if we will ever get there. â€œHow long do we have to tolerate that kind of greed, which has done so much harm to this country?â€ Sanders says of Wall Street banks. â€œWe gotta break them up!â€ The audience, indefatigable, leaps to its feet and chants â€œBREAK THEM UP! BREAK THEM UP! BREAK THEM UP!â€ â€œA corrupt campaign finance system breeds corrupt public policy,â€ Bernie Sanders says. â€œSo right now, you have profitable corporations making billions of dollars a year in profit, that in a given year, put their money in the Cayman Islands and in a given year do not pay a nickel in federal taxes!â€ â€œChildren sleep out in the street and are undernourished and corporations do not pay a nickel in federal taxes   that, together, we are going to change. â€ â€œThis campaign is about building a   grassroots campaign organization,â€ Sanders says. â€œThis campaign is about bringing millions of people into the political process. This campaign is about empowering people to understand that democracy is not a spectator sport, and that when we stand together, we can transform this country. â€ â€œRight now,â€ Sanders says, â€œthere are meetings of the Democratic platform committee   we have five people on it. The platform that will come out of the Democratic convention will be, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the party. â€ â€œBut the platform is 50 or 60 pages of paper,â€ Sanders says. â€œThat platform doesnâ€™t mean anything unless we make certain that those ideas are incorporated into public policy!â€ The audience leaps to its feat. â€œWeâ€™re gonna take a hard look at our disastrous trade policies, making sure that the TPP is dead!â€ Sanders says, of the   Partnership. â€œAnd, in Orlando, appropriately enough, weâ€™re gonna fight to make sure that we ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons, that we end the   loophole. â€ â€œIf you were talking to somebody from another world, and you had to explain the Republican rules on guns, and you said that we have lists of people who canâ€™t get on planes,â€ Sanders says, â€œbut no problem, they can walk into a gun store, people would think you were crazy!â€ Bernie Sanders has gone into full    railing against the pharmaceutical industry for the high cost of healthcare, and intimating that the mainstream media fails to cover the high prices of prescription drugs because of advertising revenue. â€œI was very proud to see that now a majority of Democrats in fact support a      system,â€ Sanders says. â€œHere is an issue that together we have brought to the floor, and it ainâ€™t never gonna go away. â€ â€œWe have got to make public colleges and universities  !â€ Sanders says, reiterating another popular plank of his candidacy. â€œI have no doubt, I have zero doubt that this is a fight that weâ€™re going to win. â€ Speaking of the   debt of many college graduates, Sanders says: â€œThat is nonsense   it is unacceptable. â€ â€œI think it makes a lot more sense to invest in education for all of our people than to give tax breaks to billionaires!â€ Sanders says, to sustained applause. â€œAnd what started year ago is a radical idea   nobody thinks its radical anymore. â€ â€œYou know, I think most Americans would agree that when we talk about what constitutes a great nation, it is not the number of billionaires that you have, it is not the number of nuclear weapons you have, it is how you treat the most vulnerable people in the country,â€ Bernie Sanders says, again reiterating nearly verbatim a frequent adage from his stump speech. â€œAnd year after year after year, the numbers cry out at us,â€ Sanders says. â€œThis country today has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. These children are the future of this country, and they are growing up in extremely bad conditions. Housing is inadequate, nutrition is inadequate, childcare is inadequate. That is not acceptable if you are a patriotic person who loves this county   youâ€™ve gotta love the children of this country!â€ The audience leaps to its feat for roughly the twentieth time. â€œThere are schools in America where more of the kids in those schools end up in jail than they do graduating college,â€ Sanders continues, before dropping another frequent invocation: â€œMaybe its time for us to invest in jobs and education for our young people, not jails and incarceration!â€ â€œSome people think that it is idealistic, that it is utopian, to talk about making a moral economy in which the function of the economy is to provide wealth for children and the elderly and the middle class,â€ Sanders says. â€œThat is the practicality of what we have got to do, and what we can do!â€ â€œWe cannot allow ourselves to become used to the fact that weâ€™ve got hundreds of thousands of children in this country who are homeless!â€ Sanders says. â€œThat is our greatest danger   becoming used to it and thinking that it is normal. It is not normal   it is an outrage!â€ â€œNever, ever lose your sense of outrage!â€ The audience goes wild   â€œBernie! Bernie! Bernie!â€ Finally touching on the issue of â€œwhere we go from here,â€ Bernie Sanders tells the crowd that he has â€œgreat peopleâ€ involved in the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia who will push his populist agenda. â€œWe have great people on the rules committee, and one of the issues that weâ€™re going to push for on the rules committee is to end closed primaries!â€ Sanders says. â€œIt is also a fight to end the absurd situation where superdelegates can overrule the rule of the people!â€ â€œWe might as well transform the entire Democratic party!â€ Bernie Sanders tells the audience that supporters on limited incomes who raised money for his campaign were in it to win it. â€œBecause we love you!â€ a voice shouts from the crowd. â€œNonono   not about me!â€ Sanders responds, as the audience laughs and applauds. â€œIt has to be about us!â€ â€œYou know what? You can beat the establishment,â€ Bernie Sanders says, in reference to his primary campaign. â€œWe won! In New York state, we had to take on the entire Democratic establishment. â€ â€œI have no doubt that a strong,   grassroots movement can take on the establishment and can defeat the establishment, and that is precisely what we have got to do and what the political revolution is about. â€ For those unfamiliar with Sandersâ€™s stump speech, much of what follows largely reiterates aspects of the same speech he has been giving for more than a year. â€œIn this campaign, in every single state, we won, often by big numbers, the votes of young people!â€ Sanders says. â€œWhat it means is that our vision, a vision of economic, social, racial, environmental justice is the vision of the people who will create the future of America!â€ â€œIn this campaign, hundreds of thousands of volunteers made 75 million telephone calls,â€ Sanders says. â€œAnd we are just getting started!â€ â€œReal change is not easy and real change never takes place from the top on down   always from the bottom on up,â€ Bernie Sanders says, echoing a line frequently used in his stump speeches. â€œAnd that is what our political revolution is all about. â€ Sanders reveals that his new schedule of upcoming events   unusual for a candidate who has functionally lost the nomination but has not yet conceded   will be held in support of downballot candidates seeking to enter politics. In Syracuse tomorrow evening, Sanders says, â€œweâ€™ll be campaigning for a guy who is running for the United States Congress   I am gonna do everything I can do make sure that he wins. We are gonna go back to California and campaign for a woman running for the state senate in California and make sure that she wins!â€  â€œWeâ€™re gonna go all over this country, because that is what this political revolution is all about!â€ Sanders says. â€œItâ€™s not about me   itâ€™s about people at the grassroots level. Itâ€™s about people running for school boards, for mayor, for the state legislature!â€ What our campaign has been about and is about is saying   sorry! weâ€™re thinking big, we want real change! The audience leaps to its feet, chanting â€œBernie! Bernie! Bernie!â€ Bernie Sanders reminds the audience that other social movements, like those for civil rights and womenâ€™s suffrage, lasted for decades before eventually succeeding. Remind yourselves, Sanders tells the crowd, to the â€œpeople who were killed, people who were beaten, people who were jailed standing up for dignity and human rights. â€ â€œThink about the gay movement! Think about Stonewall!â€ Sanders says. â€œThink about the revolutionary changes that have taken place because the gay community and their straight allies said that people should have, must have, he right to be with who they love, regardless of gender!â€ â€œI want you al to remember   now I was there, Iâ€™m a little bit older than many of you,â€ Sanders jokes, bringing laughs from the youthful crowd, â€œbut people stood up proudly and with dignity and they continued the fight for gay rights. â€   years ago, Sanders signed a proclamation as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, declaring June 22 â€œGay Pride Day. â€ Speaking to the crowd of 1, 500 supporters at the Town Hall theater in Midtown Manhattan, Bernie Sanders promises that although his path to the Democratic presidential nomination remains uncertain, his â€œpolitical revolutionâ€ will continue. â€œThe main point that Iâ€™m gonna make tonight,â€ Sanders says, â€œis this political rev is not about Bernie Sanders, itâ€™s not about Nina Turner   itâ€™s about you and millions of other people. â€ In the political revolution inspired by his candidacy, Sanders says, â€œyou are the revolutionaries! And what this campaign has shown, not just in winning 13 million votes, not just taking on the establishment all over this county, what is has shown is that millions of people are prepared to stand up, fight back and create the nation that we know we can become. â€ The audience explodes into applause. â€œAll of you know, who have studied history, that election days come and go but what is much

Though the formal talks, which began last month, appeared to have led to the release of a handful of detained activists, hopes for real rapprochement were always slim. The two sides are fundamentally at loggerheads, with the opposition seeking to oust the socialist president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, while authorities vow he will not leave office before his term ends in 2019.  â€œThe government, in an irresponsible manner, froze the dialogue process by not showing up to two technical meetings last night,â€ opposition coalition leader JesÃºs Torrealba told Reuters.  Opposition activists said authorities backed away after the national assembly on Tuesday held a heated session in which they slammed Maduro over a drug scandal.  Two nephews of Maduroâ€™s wife were found guilty this month on charges in the US that they tried to carry out a   drug deal to help their family stay in power.  â€œThe government is using the debate as an excuse,â€ said   presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, accusing authorities of not being committed to talks.  â€œThe government has not complied with any of its promises. They promised to free political prisoners there are more than 100 imprisoned. They promised [to open] a humanitarian channel not a single medicine has come in. â€  The information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  It was not clear if the talks could be revived or if the opposition would resume a more militant agenda, which before the talks included protests and putting Maduro on trial before the national assembly.  Mediators appeared to be trying to save the talks. Spainâ€™s   minister JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero and US diplomat Thomas Shannon were holding or seeking meetings with both sides.  Dialogue had divided the diverse opposition coalition, with some activists feeling the government was duping the opposition to buy time. Previous   also showed little progress. The situation in   Venezuela has worsened in the past few months, with a recession leaving millions unable to find or afford food amid shortages and soaring inflation.  The opposition blames Maduro, who is unpopular, and has been vying to remove him via a recall referendum. The former bus driver and union leader, however, has said the opposition is actually seeking a coup against him and has vowed to see out his term.

politifact15135,https://www.libertyheadlines.com/seattle-police-begin-gun-confiscations-no-laws-broken-no-warrant-no-charges/,"Seattle Police Begin Gun Confiscations: No Laws Broken, No Warrant, No Charges","When I was 16, my dad and I were parked outside the Express Dairy in Wembley, chatting in the front of our car. Weâ€™d been there for about 10 minutes when there was a knock on the window. It was a police officer. Someone had reported the presence of two suspicious men in a vehicle. As we drove off, my dad chuckled at the idea that anyone could think of us, a   man and his son in a Volvo estate, as a threat. I laughed too, but I wouldnâ€™t have if Iâ€™d realised that incidents like this were soon to become commonplace. Here, in 1984, was an end to boyhood and the start of my journey into adulthood  â€”   into becoming a black man. What this meant in practice was that my body was no longer my own. Being a black man means being subject to the white gaze. It means becoming an object of prejudice and fascination, simultaneously hypervisible and invisible to white society, your emotions and inner life ignored. The tropes are familiar and still potent: black men as supernaturally gifted at sports and entertainment, in possession of hulking bodies and ungovernable sexuality, liable to lapse into violence and lawlessness. When I walk down the street, the sense of being scrutinised and judged and typecast still is never far from my mind. Itâ€™s an uncomfortable feeling to live with. But, given the option, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d ever choose to surrender it. Through that awareness of how different, contradictory, perspectives can flourish simultaneously, great art can emerge art that puts black men at the centre of an image as nuanced subjects rather than stereotypes. Iâ€™ve attempted to explore these themes of identity, maleness, race and power in a new exhibition, Made You Look, at the Photographerâ€™s Gallery in London. The show examines how black men shape their   in front of the camera. It gathers work by artists including Malick Sidibe, celebrated for capturing the vibrant life of a newly independent Mali in the 1960s and 70s Samuel Fosso, who pictures himself in a variety of slyly amusing guises and assumed identities and Hassan Hajjaj, who photographed men meticulously dressed in vivid African prints against bright backgrounds of clashing colours. This is a time of marked gain and loss for black people. For while this is a period of unprecedented black prominence  â€”   from Barack Obama in the White House to artists such as BeyoncÃ©, Steve McQueen, Marlon James, Kanye West  â€”   black people are still victim to the consequences of entrenched racism. More than 500 black and   people in Britain have died in suspicious circumstances while in state detention over the past 25 years, without a single official being successfully prosecuted. In America, one in three black men can expect to go to jail at some point in their lives. And the list of   men killed in recent years solely because of their skin colour  â€”   Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Freddie Gray among them  â€”   continues to grow. Against this fragile backdrop, Made You Look focuses on the figure of the black dandy. Dandyism, defined as a man â€œunduly concerned with looking stylish and fashionableâ€ might seem like trivial concerns in the era of the Black Lives Matter campaign. But as the case of Trayvon Martin, shot by George Zimmerman for looking â€œsuspiciousâ€ in a hoodie, attests to the fact that how you dress can sometimes be the difference between life and death. Dandyism is also about using dress to flout conventional notions of class, taste, gender and sexuality  â€”   certainly the case with the majestically louche Soweto youth majestically decked out in flared sleeveless suits and pearls, shot by South African   Moolman, and the strikingly beautiful young man photographed in New York by Jeffrey Henson Scales. Such images point to the subversive power of dandyism to reveal masculinity itself as a performance, as something provisional, open to reinterpretation, rather than a set of inherited characteristics fixed in the skin. And they also highlight how, for black men, style is a form of radical personal politics. As a teenager, having to grapple for the first time with the force of the white gaze, Iâ€™d ask myself this question: how do you live without fear or debilitating anger in a world where youâ€™re constantly reminded that your body doesnâ€™t belong to you? The answer, as proposed by the works in this show, is to demand to be seen on your own terms, via the style and attitude that announces your ambitions and desires, your sense of pride and inner belief. For the most part, the men featured in the exhibition arenâ€™t wearing the finest of clothes. They seem less concerned with what they wear than how they wear it. Their style is by turns flamboyant, provocative, arresting, camp, playful and assertive. It is about confounding expectations about how black men should look or carry themselves in order to establish a place of personal freedom: a place beyond the white gaze, where the black body is a site of liberation rather than oppression.

MartÃ­nez was sacked on Thursday following a dismal run of results and performances that indicated the players had stopped responding to his methods. Southamptonâ€™s manager, Ronald Koeman, is the preferred replacement of Farhad Moshiri, Evertonâ€™s major shareholder, with Frank de Boer also under consideration. David Unsworth, Joe Royle and Duncan Ferguson will take charge of Evertonâ€™s final home game of the season against Norwich City on Sunday, when Howard will bring his distinguished decade with the club to an end. The USA international is to join Colorado Rapids in MLS on 1 July. Howard was on the bench for feeble away displays at Liverpool, Leicester City and Sunderland  â€”   when there were a total of 84 shots on the Everton goal  â€”   and denies witnessing a team that had stopped playing for their manager. â€œThat is a grenade that people throw and they duck and watch to see what happens. Itâ€™s a load of rubbish,â€ the Everton goalkeeper insisted. â€œThere is so much in the head of a footballer. You pull that shirt on, you run out on the pitch and the last thing that crosses your mind is: â€˜Hey, Iâ€™ve got an idea, Iâ€™m just going to strut around here because I am going to get the manager sacked. Letâ€™s do that.â€™ â€œI donâ€™t know how that works. I donâ€™t think anyone thinks like that individually. We donâ€™t sit around in the dressing room and have a   that we are all going to down tools. I donâ€™t really know where that comes from. â€ MartÃ­nez repeatedly denied that a squad he labelled the strongest of his tenure had underachieved this season. Everton are 12th in the Premier League and have recorded the lowest points total at home since the introduction of three points for a win in 1981. Howard said: â€œI think we have underachieved this season. The players have probably let ourselves down. Any time a manager loses his job, they canâ€™t replace 22 of us, which is probably unfortunate for them. It is always the manager who ends up suffering. Roberto has not kicked a ball all season. That is down to us. The results have not been good enough for the talent we have and the squad. That is no secret. â€œEveryone needs a bit of luck. We have a fantastic squad here that keeps getting talked about. We are going to finish   or just below. We have no   right to do anything or finish higher. We have to earn that right. This team is good enough to compete near the top and if it has been a disappointing year then so be it. â€œThe foundation is there. The next manager that comes in will be delighted to see some of the faces here at his disposal and to be able to mould that team, play the way he wants to. He will be sitting on a goldmine. â€ The    will make his 414th and final Everton appearance on Sunday, having decided against staying at Goodison Park until his contract expires in 2018. Howard had a few   with supporters before losing his place to Joel Robles midway through the season but insists the exchanges played no part in his decision to return to the US. â€œI was irritated that we werenâ€™t playing well,â€ he said. â€œI love the supporters here. They get pissed off when we lose, I get pissed off when we lose. I never go home happy when we lose. It is no different. Someone has something to say to me that is   then I say something back even if it is at the grocery store or at Goodison. There wasnâ€™t any spat. They were pissed off we werenâ€™t playing well and so was I. â€œThat didnâ€™t influence my thinking about the future. My plan was always to see out my contract  â€”   I love this club. As we know this is a business and it is a tough business sometimes. I have two young children, I wanted to have an opportunity leading up to the World Cup to be in the shop window right in front of my [international] manager every week. â€œFrom a contractual stand point, Colorado offered me another year and a half on the back of my contract. Those are all real things. People talk about footballers being robots but this is all real life. If that was offered to my dad in the truck yard he would probably take it because it makes sense. Ten years seemed like the right time.

politifact14361,http://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-move-to-canada-if-donald-trump-becomes-president-2016-11,9 celebrities who say they'll move to Canada if Donald Trump becomes president,"The    home of Josiah Bartlett, a New Hampshire doctor who signed the Declaration of Independence after John Hancock and later became governor, is still available two years after it was put up for sale by his     granddaughter. Bartlett is also the fictional ancestor of one of Americaâ€™s greatest fictional presidents, Josiah Bartlet, who was played by Martin Sheen in the   TV hit The West Wing. His actual descendant, Ruth Albert, has spent much of her life in the house in the town of Kingston. Now 65, she wants to downsize. Albert has no children, however, and she has exhausted her list of cousins. Last year, she was approached by a fellow   Bartlett who lives in Florida, but that didnâ€™t work out. â€œI held on and held on,â€ the retired postal worker said, adding that the Florida descendant was considering moving to New Hampshire to pursue a doctorate.  â€œI guess at one point in time, she was thinking it would be kind of cool to go to Dartmouth, because thatâ€™s where a lot of our ancestors got their doctorate degrees. And then I think she decided it was just a little too cold up there. â€ Albert took the property, about 10 miles from Massachusetts, off the market for the winter and advertised it again this spring. The      colonial farmhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is selling for $549, 900. It has a linden tree that Bartlett brought back from Philadelphia as a sapling after signing the Declaration of Independence. Little has changed beyond kitchen and bathroom renovations and mechanical upgrades. Bartlettâ€™s medical instruments are displayed in the parlor. One end of the second floor still has an outhouse and tin bathtub with a pump. Additional land near the house can be bought, bringing the price to $849, 900. â€œPeople have been coming to look at it, but I havenâ€™t had any serious offers,â€ Albert said. Ben Wilson, director of New Hampshireâ€™s Bureau of Historic Sites, said the state could not afford to buy and operate the house without an endowment. â€œHistoric buildings, landscapes and monuments take an extra level of care, so the bureau tries very hard to make the most of the resources it has,â€ he said.  â€œTaking on a new property that is not endowed would place an extra burden on the services and experiences we currently provide to our thousands of visitors. â€ Plan New Hampshire, a group that evaluates communitiesâ€™ strengths, said the house was â€œuniquely important to the town, the state and the countryâ€ and that it could be used as a restaurant, brewery or bed and breakfast. Bartlett was born in Amesbury, Massachusetts in 1729. He moved to Kingston in 1750 to set up practice. He married his cousin Mary Bartlett, and they had 12 children. He died in 1795. One of his sons, Dr Levi Bartlett, lived in the house, and it has stayed in the family since.",89,508,"703952212117102592	796221342366498816	818544868238782465	885210704130830336	885323259004112897	885350333299531777	885350734337847296	885483370624503808	885527098949029889	885643507301482497	885664369035685888	947175378614878218	949410161491263489	952559272914759680	963437452831506432	1002176339103936513	1024609352433524737	1064190899431899137",fake
politifact14090,http://breaking13news.com/malia-obama-arrested-gang-thugs-chicago/,Malia Obama Arrested With A Gang Of Thugs In Chicago,"Las Vegas is due to witness its most surreal showdown since Mike Tyson repeatedly bit Evander Holyfieldâ€™s ear in the middle of a heavyweight boxing match, as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off in the third and final debate before the presidential election. For Trump, Wednesday nightâ€™s debate may be the last opportunity to salvage the dwindling support that in recent weeks has seemingly placed the election increasingly out of the Republican nomineeâ€™s reach. The encounter at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, comes as both campaigns are beset by controversy in the final stretch of the most unusual presidential campaign in modern history. Clinton has been forced to contend with the illegal hacking of her campaign chairmanâ€™s emails, leaked in tranches by WikiLeaks in what the US government has described as the work of Russian intelligence.  Trump has faced even greater obstacles, stemming from an unearthed tape in which he boasted of groping women without their consent that prompted a number of women to come forward with accusations of sexual assault against the real estate mogul over a nearly   period. The debate, moderated by Fox Newsâ€™ Chris Wallace, will focus on six topics: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president. But as in the last two debates between Trump and Clinton, policy is expected to take a back seat to the unpredictable behaviour associated with Trump. The former reality TV star, who has spent the past week darkly warning of voter fraud, has one more chance to try to staunch his leaking support in the polls. Polling aggregator Real Clear Politics shows Clinton with an average lead of almost seven points in recent polls, a lead comparable to that of Barack Obama over John McCain at a similar point in the 2008 election. Even deeply Republican states such as Alaska, Utah and Texas are within the margin of error in some surveys and the Clinton campaign, buoyed by its momentum, is now investing in conservative battlegrounds that include Arizona, Indiana and Missouri. Clinton has maintained a tradition of burying herself in debate preparation in recent days, thus keeping a lighter footprint on the campaign trail. Trump, by contrast, has been notoriously averse to readying himself for the debates and has suffered through two below par performances. Even so, the Republican nominee mocked Clinton at a Colorado rally on Tuesday as â€œrestingâ€. â€œItâ€™s lying down and going to sleep,â€ Trump said, taking another veiled jab at Clintonâ€™s health despite records disclosed by the former secretary of state last month showing no significant medical issues. Clintonâ€™s campaign said her focus would remain on policy in the debate regardless of Trumpâ€™s efforts to rattle her with criticisms intended for a base that routinely engages in chants of â€œLock her upâ€ at his rallies. â€œWhat we have seen is that when she does do that, the character of Hillary Clinton thatâ€™s revealed to voters is someone that is quite capable of standing up to him and defending American values and reaffirming them,â€ Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for Clintonâ€™s campaign, told reporters on Tuesday. â€œWe know that [Trump] thought that strategy of scorched earth would depress our vote but, if anything, we have found that itâ€™s helped to motivate our voters. â€ Trump, having shown himself to be lacking in substance on the issues, will have to rely on his improvisational style to carry him through the   encounter. But Wednesday night will mark the first time Trump will be questioned before a national audience of this scale about the sexual assault allegations against him, as well as his baseless claims of voter fraud to assert that the election is â€œriggedâ€. Several   Republicans have refuted Trumpâ€™s claim of illicit activity at the ballot box. Palmieri did not say if Clinton would address the matter at the debate, stating instead that the campaign was â€œconfident in the electionâ€. â€œWe understand the strategy that he is trying to do to explain his loss and also to try to deter voters,â€ she said, â€œ[but] we believe that itâ€™s going to be easier to vote than ever before. â€ While most of those on the Las Vegas Strip were busy milling between slot machines and Blackjack tables on the eve of the debate, many acknowledged the gambling would come to a halt on Wednesday evening. The election, several people said, was simply too captivating. Javier Solano, of Yuma, Arizona, said he was on holiday but would not miss the final event. â€œI donâ€™t know what to expect from Trump,â€ he said, â€œbut he isnâ€™t a candidate fit to be president. â€ Solano, who said he was voting for Clinton, had some advice for Trumpâ€™s supporters: â€œYou canâ€™t just be angry. You have to make the right choice, thinking not just about what affects you but what affects everyone. â€ Joe Jessome, of Ontario, Canada, was in town for a conference but also planned to watch the debate. Jessome, who said his American wife and two children planned to cast their ballots for Trump, expects a more â€œbalancedâ€ debate under the helm of Fox News. â€œI think the moderators are really biased toward the Democrats and Hillary Clinton,â€ he said. â€œ[Although] Donald Trump speaks before he thinks a lot of the time and made lewd comments 11 years ago   â€¦     itâ€™s more about the economy and whatâ€™s going on in the world. Hillary Clinton, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, is â€˜Crooked Hillaryâ€™. â€ Brandon Davis, a Trump supporter from California, agreed. â€œEveryoneâ€™s been against him from the beginning,â€ he said, while noting Clinton had â€œa lot of baggageâ€. While the debates have been marked by a bitterness bordering on contempt, Clinton and Trump will meet again at a decidedly more   venue on Thursday. Both candidates are scheduled to attend the Alfred E Smith dinner, an annual fundraiser for Catholic charities in New York, less than 24 hours after they share the debate stage. The two will sit on either side of Cardinal Timothy Dolan at the white tie gala.",771,377,"860598566041120770	860609994693193728	860621157736869888	860625932826095617	860647071753400320	860647104129241092	860647481876647936	860654533835444225	860657578744758272	860657617051336705	860657645505495040	860657648332554241	860657666556809216	860661882520207361	860662456602943488	860669641877839874	860670844766310400	860677360273825793	860682709949194240	860682857332846593	860751446979072000	860814938004221953	860857737634344961	860876064452739073	860877718178729984	860890238331301888	860892627234893824	860903712083947520	860904017785794560	860904026719739904	860904038769897472	860904055207469057	860908388389146626	860911979111751680	860911984992071680	860911984635555841	860911985923284993	860911999814742016	860912013991596032	860912016982122496	860912028378058752	860912034312929280	860912047663439873	860912047143264256	860912045134274560	860912060481142785	860912059034198016	860912061689110529	860912065417887745	860912073164824576	860912073047330821	860912071327727616	860912071189209088	860912070002212864	860912080462856192	860912078722277376	860912082241306624	860912097642684416	860912102893944832	860912101182787584	860912107063091200	860912119960657920	860919879750242304	860919890936451072	860919890214961153	860919894644187136	860920676726652928	860921751521374210	860929134452539392	860940064154681345	860944790933786627	860947957188669440	860959683087093760	860960364770492417	860975415615266816	860977913969225728	860982083086200836	860983111043121152	860992758571520001	861007062637195265	861018129278939136	861024013744779264	861025552907370496	861026075505242112	861029901763325952	861035735142473728	861043468088602624	861054935810617345	861059168861536257	861064240119115776	861069853406507008	861109028268556289	861119482227458048	861161610005577732	861166225572941826	861170473803145216	861177480337440768	861197427327590400	861218677244481536	861241919585869825	861241964322279425	861262050814722049	861273131075465216	861277160983625729	861299292841148416	861299418989023232	861326121316392960	861334396317642756	861335812796932096	861340635332091905	861342198788493312	861342823097839616	861344941745725444	861345489718882304	861346093732290561	861369079185235969	861373915100311552	861380368137682948	861394110766239745	861395717998432256	861420679345909760	861430348017795072	861565252659548160	861576190607458304	861576320341479424	861576752576868352	861576750538436609	861576761477222400	861576762517368832	861576773552582656	861576781450452996	861576800123662338	861576799960023042	861576810814779392	861580284566917120	861581742095912960	861585630362427392	861585900043608064	861597748658917377	861603211152699392	861603397727903745	861603404593979393	861603459728068608	861603630578896896	861603689554903042	861603785721823232	861603812305285120	861603970858483713	861603978580180994	861603976470437888	861603983147892737	861603995743264768	861604034121056256	861604150571827200	861604869479825408	861604932457246721	861606296663064577	861607090535579653	861607390533136384	861608022048722944	861608443546939393	861610836221210624	861611964778393602	861615603613925376	861641252642721792	861657336942743552	861657389082136581	861661657545814018	861661838521585665	861683765776715776	861685236501016579	861706639115563008	861707373727162373	861708311325941760	861713421116592129	861713502976737280	861713915322941440	861718096867979264	861720178840674304	861720435133644801	861722368410038273	861727824306221057	861734401712979968	861734765011095553	861744697076846594	861749240502071297	861751133001457664	861752680611549184	861756165553885184	861758363796983808	861764151693258752	861769732269146113	861772462219984896	861775511885885440	861775518705864706	861781126221709312	861784176709652481	861784463268773888	861792447231401984	861792782633009152	861817525377671168	861868880335175680	861887606568755205	861907360104820736	861935631991046145	861956156792745986	861956166200553472	861961010747506688	861985334581751808	862041255076823040	862447523776020480	862672388768575488	862810537012461568	863151726513332227	863152099932196865	863153692555522048	863158972408373248	863170949692182528	863221914671738881	863230936736964609	863474774487465984	863489606444085248	863874086711296004	864180726157029376	864181599142858752	864209761549467658	864604891746111491	873955844383064065	874696970245464064	876202731890933760	879667818962276353	881800523225198597	882816461462544384	894345509414072320	900728787297607680	905962810554843137	906065638069858309	916786824038830080	927803136613462016	935007914594619392	943859648972632064",fake
politifact14785,https://web.archive.org/web/20171114110855/http://www.soutwest-air.com:80/?,Southwest Airlines 2017,"This past Thursday was Thanksgiving. A time when we remember a feast, the first Thanksgiving, on Plymouth plantation in the autumn of 1621. The tales of pilgrims from the Mayflower who celebrated the harvest, shared and broke bread with the first Americans, are still used as inspiration and shared with children, teaching them the beauty of gratitude. But it is now widely understood this Thanksgiving story is a fictional history. It was invented to whitewash the vicious genocide wrought upon the native inhabitants of this magnificent continent. Not only did the Europeans try to eradicate native populations, but they made every effort to eviscerate their culture, their language and eliminate them from these coveted lands. From Plymouth Rock to Standing Rock, this lie has made our Thanksgiving Day a day of mourning for the First Nations, all the tribes big and small, those who came before us. A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux In North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over 500 tribes and thousands of others standing on the frontlines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. The camp grows as winter comes. Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty. Everyone we talk with is committed to peaceful resistance. Weapons, alcohol and drugs are forbidden there. Standing together in prayer to protect water displays a deeply rooted awareness of lifeâ€™s interconnected nature, and of the intrinsic value and import of traditional ways. This growing movement stems from love, it is the most human instinct to protect that which we love. An eager and engaged youth are at the core of this pipeline route resistance, learning from a population of elders who pass down unforgotten knowledge.  It is an awakening. All here together, with their   relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and national guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, above all other expressed concerns. They stand against corporate security forces, the county sheriff and the national guard. Standing while being hit with water cannons, mace, teargas, rubber bullets. Standing without weapons and praying, the water protectors endure human rights abuses in freezing temperatures. Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world, that an American corporate media is not free to report. Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. But they stand, their hair frozen from water cannons. They stand for all that is good and they stay strong. We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately.  We will be going back to support the water protectors again.  Let us all stand with them in thanks, in appreciation for the ancient wisdom they carry, in thanks for this opportunity for true gratitude. For giving us a path forward. For trying to show us a road to survival. We offer our support and our respect. We hear the call to protect the water protectors to listen, learn and get engaged. They are brave. We thank them. And we can give thanks for the bounty. Like water on the garden of activism, Americaâ€™s surprise president brings a bounty of opportunity. The great issues of our time are now brightly illuminated and people are becoming more aware of them than ever, from sea to shining sea, from Standing Rock to Wall Street. The surprise   was not the winner of the popular vote, does not have a mandate for the change of ideals envisioned. Keep in mind, close to over two million more people voted for another candidate. Nor is the surprise president the leader of the free world. Two hundred of the worldâ€™s nations believe in science, above the profits of the oil, gas and coal industries, and are committed to working together to protect the future from an unchecked climate crisis. The surprise president claims he does not believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways. Do not be intimidated by the surprise presidentâ€™s cabinet appointees as they descend the golden escalator. Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders. The golden tower is not yours. The White House is your house.  Your growing activism in support of freedom over repression, addressing climate change, swiftly replacing a destructive old industries with safe, regenerative energy, encouraging holistic thinking in balance with the future of our planet that activism will strengthen and shed continued light on us all. These worthy goals must be met for all the worldâ€™s children and theirs after them.  This is our moment for truth.  Unintimidated, stand, speak up and show up. Be counted. Be like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock. Be there if you can. The progress we have made over 240 years as a nation, has always come first from the people.

Beckham, who ran afoul of the NFLâ€™s   uniform policy even though he wore them only during   and not Sundayâ€™s   win over the Detroit Lions, went on to accuse the NFL of a double standard when Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott was spared a fine after jumping into an oversize Salvation Army kettle to celebrate a touchdown. â€œI got fined 18k for Craig Sager cleats that were auction off the cleats to the highest bidder and donating the proceeds to his cancer research,â€ Beckham wrote on Wednesday in an Instagram post. â€œ18k like itâ€™s nothing to them, no warning to take them off or anything noTHING!â€ The remarks were in response to a post by Washington wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who was apparently also fined by the league for cleats that failed to conform to the leagueâ€™s tightly enforced standards.

politifact15294,,Post claiming free tickets on Allegiant Air,"Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome at the White House on Thursday as the   met Barack Obama for a   private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first stage of a   transition process between Tuesdayâ€™s unexpected election victory and Trumpâ€™s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men discussed â€œforeign and domestic policyâ€ and how to ensure the handover of power went smoothly. â€œI want to emphasise to you, Mr   that we now are going to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,â€ Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity afterwards. A grinning Trump gave Obama a pat on the back as they got up to leave, and boasted to reporters of how long he had just spent in the Oval Office, though the president  â€”   more   until then  â€”   jokingly advised him not to take any questions. While they spoke, Trumpâ€™s wife Melania was shown around their new home in the official residence and East Wing by Michelle Obama, reportedly discussing what it was like to raise children in the White House.  Trump appeared to relish the welcome, though White House officials did not allow photographs of the traditional greeting outside. Obama appeared stiff and subdued throughout. â€œThis was a meeting that was going to last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and we were just going to get to know each other,â€ said Trump in the brief remarks to reporters he gave from an ornate armchair usually occupied by world leaders.  â€œWe had never met each other. I have great respect. The meeting lasted for almost an hour and a half. And it could have  â€”   as far as Iâ€™m concerned, it could have gone on for a lot longer. â€ Asked if he would seek advice from Obama in the future, despite intense criticism from both of them toward the other in the past, Trump described his political opponent as a â€œvery good manâ€. â€œWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties,â€ said the   according to the official White House transcript of their remarks. â€œI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. He explained some of the difficulties, some of the   assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved. â€ Briefing reporters afterwards, press secretary Josh Earnest said he did not know what Trump had meant by â€œ  assetsâ€ and denied the Republicanâ€™s claim that only 10 minutes had originally been scheduled. But he insisted the meeting was â€œa little less awkward than some might have expectedâ€ and tried to explain Obamaâ€™s comment that the meeting had been â€œexcellentâ€. â€œWhen you consider the profound differences between the two gentlemen and the fact they have never met before . .. I think that qualifies as â€˜excellentâ€™,â€ said Earnest. Washington has quickly adopted a deferential approach toward the future    despite widespread demonstrations in major US cities since Tuesdayâ€™s election and reports of an increase in racist attacks aimed at immigrants. As votes from California and other   states on the west coast were slowly processed on Thursday, Clinton was on track to exceed Trumpâ€™s share of the popular vote by 1. 2% fueling concern about the mandate for sweeping change.  Yet there were no protests visible outside the White House in the hour leading up to Trumpâ€™s arrival. One woman with a placard saying â€œstand up to racismâ€ laid it on the ground as she was interviewed by a succession of media crews, though other protesters were expected during the meeting. Instead, the traditional Marine guard stood stiffly outside the West Wing as Trumpâ€™s motorcade swept in from Ronald Reagan airport, where he left his trademark Boeing  . The US Secret Service has announced a temporary   zone for commercial aircraft over Trump Tower in New York, where the   will continue to live for the next few weeks. Trumpâ€™s motorcade arrived on the South Lawn at the White House, which is not visible to journalists or the public. He also refused to allow the usual presence of a pooled media representative with him as he travelled. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump would travel back to New York on Thursday night. In a sharp change of tone, much of the US news media has treated Trump with the respectful approach usually granted to the US head of state when performing ceremonial duties, referring to the   informally as PEOTUS. During the Oval Office meeting, Ivanka Trumpâ€™s husband Jared Kushner  â€”   a likely top aide in the next administration  â€”   was escorted through the Rose Garden by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough.    Joe Biden was due to meet with his successor, Mike Pence, while Trump headed to meet Republican congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill. They have pledged to give him full support in repealing key Democratic legislation such as Obamacare and international climate change accords. Trumpâ€™s election win has already ignited protests across the US, with thousands of demonstrators crowding into streets and surrounding his buildings in major American cities during the first night after the result. The protests  â€”   in cities including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia and Seattle  â€”   erupted after the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, lost the electoral college and presidential race on Tuesday night despite almost certainly winning the popular vote. As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue and marched by Trump Tower, carrying signs that read â€œNot my presidentâ€ â€œShe got more votesâ€ and â€œHands off my pussyâ€ a reference to a leaked recording where Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because of his fame. A number of arrests were made. Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square  â€”   35 blocks downtown  â€”   continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of the  â€™s building. Behind the scenes there is also a bleak mood among many Democrats in the outgoing administration, but officially it has decided to emphasise small signs of progress in the tone adopted by Trump since his victory. â€œI have been very encouraged by the, I think, interest in   Trumpâ€™s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces,â€ said Obama. â€œAnd I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face. â€ The two also had specific conversations about how Obama would handle discussions with foreign leaders on an upcoming overseas trip. They also discussed ways of organising an effective team around the new president to handle future crises. â€œThey spent a large portion of the meeting discussing the importance of properly staffing and organising a White House,â€ Earnest, the press secretary, told reporters after the meeting. He declined to answer questions about whether they discussed Trumpâ€™s promise to unwind much of the outgoing administrationâ€™s achievements over the last eight years. â€œPresident Obama came away from the meeting with renewed confidence in the commitment of the   to ensure a smooth transition,â€ said Earnest. No staff were in the room during the meeting, but Earnest stressed it was unrealistic to expect the meeting to smooth over all that had gone beforehand. â€œI feel confident in telling you that they did not resolve all of their differences, but I also feel confident in telling you that they did not try to resolve all of their differences. â€ He said he was not aware of any additional meeting that has been scheduled but â€œwouldnâ€™t rule out anythingâ€ after Trump spoke of wanting to hear Obamaâ€™s counsel. It is thought the meeting in Washington on Thursday was the only time they have been in same room since Obama ridiculed Trumpâ€™s claims about his birthplace at a White House correspondentsâ€™ dinner in 2011.

politifact15616,http://www.neonnettle.com/news/4514-british-politician-beaten-by-protestors-for-welcoming-trump-to-the-uk-,British Politician Beaten by Protestors for 'Welcoming Trump to the UK',"There seems to be some truth in the old saying that the third timeâ€™s the charm, at least when it comes to Philadelphiaâ€™s passage of a soda tax. After two previous attempts failed, on 16 June Philadelphiaâ€™s city council voted to pass a tax of 1. 5 cents per ounce on both regular and diet soda beverages.  Soda sales and their impact on the epidemic of obesity are a hot topic across the US, and much of the world. Philadelphia is the   city in the US and the largest to successfully pass such a proposal. Only tiny, liberal bastion Berkeley, California, had passed a plan until last week. Since 2008, some 43 other taxes have been proposed in cities and municipalities and all have failed, faced down by the powerful drinksâ€™ lobby. Soda sales are declining  â€”   in the US they soon look set to be outstripped by sales of bottled water. But still 17% of Americans drink soda at least once every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And consumption is higher among black and Hispanic Americans and in southern states, where obesity is also above average.  Experts see Philadelphiaâ€™s success, and the innovative strategy it adopted to get there, as a sign that other cities will soon follow. â€œThis is an important harbinger of what is going to come and people in Philadelphia will see this as important part of their history,â€ predicted Kelly Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, who is an advocate of the soda tax. Historically, the idea for a soda tax first came up in the context of improving health, Brownell said. But initiatives that focused on the tax as a means to cut consumption for health reasons have met with derision and failed. Americans donâ€™t like being told what to do and the soda lobby has used that to its advantage. Recasting the tax as a budget issue, as Philadelphiaâ€™s mayor Jim Kenney did, has proved more palatable. The tax, which is projected to bring in $91m in the first year, will be used to pay for expanding   as well as improving parks, libraries and recreation centers. Philadelphia has high fixed costs which made it difficult to find revenue to pay for expanding   in the city, explains Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Kenney. The mayor did not want to raise property taxes again, said Hitt, so the soda tax was settled on as an alternative revenue source to help fund   expansion. David Goldberg, spokesman for Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda tax initiatives, predicts that San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, California as well as Boulder, Colorado, will all pass similar taxes this year in the wake of Philadelphiaâ€™s success. A number of other cities are now in the primary stages of considering the tax as well, he adds. The American Beverage Association (ABA) the lobbying group for soda manufacturers, which strongly opposes the tax, has said it will â€œtake legal action to stop itâ€ according to spokeswoman Lauren Kane. The ABA has referred to the tax as â€œregressiveâ€ and â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ noting that â€œsimilar tax proposals have been rejected 43 times across the country in the past eight years, including twice in Philadelphiaâ€. A tax can be regressive if a larger percentage of a poor personâ€™s income goes into acquiring an item, or a lower income bracket is taxed at a higher rate than a higher income bracket. Philadelphia feels confident about its legal standing, said Hitt, noting that the cityâ€™s lawyers vetted the proposal and addressed all the arguments that the ABA has raised. The US has many regressive taxes, and being regressive alone does not make a tax impermissible, explained Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting, citing examples of other regressive taxes such as tobacco and alcohol taxes which impact the poor disproportionately more than the better off. Goldberg argues that it makes sense that a tax that impacts poorer communities, would also be the one that benefits those communities by expanding early education for children. It was a smart policy decision by Philadelphiaâ€™s mayor to â€œcarve out some of the industry profits that have come out of poor communities primarily and put them back into the community to benefit the future prospect of kids in those poorer communitiesâ€ Goldberg said. Other legal arguments raised include those around Pennsylvaniaâ€™s constitution, which has a uniformity clause. The uniformity clause means all items in a certain class must be taxed at the same rate, so for example all real estate, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial is taxed at the same rate. So if a tax is imposed, all beverages, including bottled water, could be seen as one class. Sweetened beverages, Hitt argues, are a distinct class because of their negative health effects. The case could â€œfor sureâ€ go to court and may take a couple of years to resolve, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. In the meantime, the ABA would seek a stay pending litigation, which it may or may not be granted, explains Briffault. Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014. Soda consumption in Berkeley was already low before the tax. The ABA did not challenge Berkeleyâ€™s soda tax, underscoring the impact Philadelphiaâ€™s tax is expected to have on similar measures in other cities. â€œIf the Philly tax didnâ€™t mean anything, the soda industry would not have plunked more than $4m into fighting it and promised more in implied bribes,â€ says Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. While Philadelphia works to implement its tax, which is slated to go into effect in January 2017, other cities are taking note of its successful strategy. â€œThere is great public support for tax funds earmarked for social purposes,â€ says Nestle. Focusing on soda taxes as a revenue source also brings â€œa whole other group of political figures to the mixâ€ points out Brownell. Previously, only politicians focused on health would get involved with soda tax proposals, but the new strategy brings in politicians who are looking for new revenue generating possibilities for projects for their constituents, explains Brownell. â€œMy guess is that the floodgates will open pretty quickly, Brownell says.",454,502,"1017730463769776133	1017730562365239300	1017733114557337600	1017733553579266048	1017735167669100544	1017750943939612674	1017753510430040065	1017756392252432386	1017761314976956422	1017765384005521409	1017772624527675393	1017796672477454336	1017811243351072768	1017815406818586624	1017823883888455681	1017824265641644032	1017831622459224064	1017832602768723968	1017839731776901121	1017877818888282112	1017893803410186240	1017900591102734338	1017901663640748034	1017910284974022656	1017928464048054273	1017933310599876608	1017942051411906561	1017947240814534656	1017962328753688577	1017964862172008449	1017975025821999104	1017998899477401600	1018041600037933056	1018055361037729792	1018113284782874624	1018120334124437509	1018133088638029825	1018137679144374272	1018149491369799681	1018159082560159745	1018161824452276225	1018169976119685120	1018196304177061888	1018207682405257217	1018216953641652225	1018220526274310150	1018221932699844610	1018226905764507648	1018232647338766338	1018233769445285891	1018235945487949824	1018236256478728192	1018260309738311681	1018282217984970757	1018298427002716160	1018311990018748416	1018348067928592384	1018415515558121473	1018434003899179008	1018456372466237440	1018482901854322688	1018483832163577856	1018486729685250051	1018505140041666561	1018551702105088001	1018551755578040321	1018565662107688960	1018579812401573888	1018581265413558275	1018592052852948997	1018595702140801025	1018610386088660992	1018612361660227584	1018647922815262721	1018651027103334400	1018697156008423426	1018701313679343616	1018720686360158208	1018736241708236800	1018859757468372992	1018884047647461378	1018905883403870208	1018993888491552769	1019007420369133568	1031473754776510464	1031473775747915776	1031479158981963776	1031518052792369152",fake

The magnetic effect of the US on Europe has always been drawn from the strength of its values  â€”   tolerance, individual rights, democracy  â€”   arguably more so than its cultural symbols, Hollywood movies,   or the iPhone. With the election of Donald Trump, a man who has declared heâ€™s in favour of torture and killing the families of terrorist offenders, and who shows admiration for autocrats, many Europeans woke up on 9 November feeling that the America they admire had been taken from them. America was never perfect by any means. No democracy is. But the erosion of Americaâ€™s image as a democracy capable of underwriting a shared liberal world order, combined with the worst instincts this risks amplifying within Europeâ€™s own political discourse, represents the biggest threat to the west as we have known it in the last seven decades. Itâ€™s a fair bet that Angela Merkel, an East German and Europeâ€™s most powerful and respected leader today, immediately felt the daunting contrast between two 9 Novembers  â€”   one the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, full of hope, the other, when Trump sealed his victory, full of anxiety. Back in 1989, when joyful crowds broke through the wall, the symbol of Europeâ€™s division and the oppression of entire nations, Merkel went to Berlinâ€™s Bornholmer Strasse crossing to the west. As a politician, Merkel has often spoken of the importance of American values to her personally, and to Europe. In 2009 she gave a speech to the US Congress  â€”   the first German chancellor to do so since Konrad Adenauer in 1957  â€”   in which she spoke of her â€œenthusiasmâ€ for â€œthe American dreamâ€ where â€œthe air is full of the spirit of freedomâ€. So it was no surprise that this 9 November, her first reaction to Trumpâ€™s election was so calibrated and forceful. She listed the â€œcommon valuesâ€ that bind Germany and the US together: â€œDemocracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views. â€ She then added: â€œIt is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation. â€ It was a remarkable statement, one that no other German chancellor has ever had to make  â€”   or indeed felt obliged to. In essence, Merkel set conditions on cooperation with the US president. She seemed to put values before the question of alliances  â€”   or at least, to rank them just as highly. And this, coming from the leader of a country whose very democracy and institutions are historically owed to Americaâ€™s postwar political engineering in Europe. I can think of no other example of a German leader taking the United States so openly and bluntly to task on the question of respecting values. Well, actually, there is a one precedent: in 2006, when Merkel first travelled to Washington as chancellor, she made a point of criticising GuantÃ¡namo, calling for the campâ€™s closure and for respect for rule of law, before meeting with George W Bush. Merkel is well aware that if today the US enters a dark and unfathomable era of illiberalism, the fallout in Europe will be immense, and the foundations of the European project, already badly shaken, will be in even greater danger. She acted last year as a guardian of the principle of international asylum. And she is deeply concerned about the risk of France being swept away by the Marine Le Pen phenomenon. Now, she is calling for Europeâ€™s powerful ally to be true to the essence of transatlantic bonds: values, not just institutions, military hardware or trade. If the US is no longer able to give the right cues, those in Europe who want to save whatever can be saved of liberal democracy find themselves   and weakened. Equally, if America cares no longer for the values that are meant to be enshrined in the EU project, then Europeâ€™s capacity to show resilience in the face of forces that want it dismantled is instantly diminished. It only takes one look at the way European demagogues and extremists have applauded Trumpâ€™s election, and another look at how it was greeted in Moscow, to know this problem of perception, the question of Americaâ€™s image and its link with Europe, is essential. There is of course much speculation about Donald Trumpâ€™s foreign policy. No doubt, his rhetoric has been worrying. But there are as yet more unknowns than knowns. What we do know for certain is that Trumpâ€™s success has wrecked the notion that the American nation wholeheartedly stands for the values of liberal democracy. And this is happening at time when those values are being increasingly questioned in Europe. Trump has cast a dark shadow on Americaâ€™s reputation, adding to the blow suffered by liberal values as a result of Britainâ€™s referendum. This is why the dread felt now by so many Europeans is as overwhelming as the excitement and optimism which seized everyone on that other 9 November, 27 years ago: 1989 was not just a victory for Europeans but a victory for America and its values. The US had not only guaranteed the security of western European countries since the second world war, it had played a crucial role in consolidating democracy and reconciliation. There simply would never have been a European project, without Americaâ€™s engagement and interest. If there is now a threat hanging over the west, it comes first and foremost from the danger that this psychological and political link with America might break. This disappointment is arguably bigger than fears that Nato defence guarantees might evaporate overnight. This is why, on the day after Americaâ€™s election, Merkel was right to speak of values rather than of alliances. She, very likely, had that 9 November anniversary in mind.",894,2,,fake

But heâ€™s just one of thousands of criminal defendants in America hoping to clear their names. Adnan Syed, the    subject of Serial, was convicted of the murder of his   Hae Min Lee after she was found strangled to death in 1999. Last week, judge Martin Welch granted Syedâ€™s request for a retrial and vacated his conviction. Syed had served more than 16 years of a life sentence before Thursdayâ€™s ruling, and his attorney has said that he might seek bail for Syed so that he can be released from prison before the proceedings continue.  The specifics of Leeâ€™s death, and the evidence implicating Syed, have been subject to intense scrutiny thanks to the attention brought by Serial and the additional investigations it spawned. But Syed is one among scores of criminal defendants who say theyâ€™ve been wrongfully convicted and are now working from behind bars to prove their innocence. Since 1989, the National Registry of Exonerations has tracked more than 1, 830 exonerations in the US, a number the registry estimates to be a â€œfractionâ€ of the total exonerations in that time period. The Guardian looked at five of the many cases across the country in which criminal defendants are seeking retrials or other recourse to clear their names. The original case: Danny Lee Hill was found guilty of multiple charges in the brutal beating and death of a    boy in Warren, Ohio. The boy died two days after he was beaten and raped in September 1985. Timothy Combs, then 17, was also found guilty in the attack. Length of imprisonment: Hill was sentenced to death in 1986, and he has waited in prison through the ongoing appeals process since then. Cause for review: When Hill, 49, was originally convicted, prosecutors said that bite marks had been found on the boyâ€™s penis and brought an oral surgeon to testify that the marks had come from Hillâ€™s teeth. The alleged bite marks were the only physical evidence presented by the prosecution that tied Hill to the crime, according to his attorney Vicki Werneke.  Since then, the scientific consensus around bite marks has shifted dramatically to acknowledge the imprecision behind   science. Hillâ€™s attorneys said they are questioning the admissibility of both the   science used to convict Hill and the confession that the    gave. They added that they plan to present testimony on the unreliability of   evidence in general as well as from a   expert who says the marks werenâ€™t made by human teeth. Whatâ€™s next: Hillâ€™s attorneys are pursuing multiple paths toward a retrial, and the state has scheduled hearings for September to determine whether there is sufficient new evidence to grant a retrial. The original case: Johnson was convicted of assault on a   death and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Johnson, a licensed daycare provider in San Diego, was arrested after an infant in her care hit her head, and later stopped breathing and died. Authorities said Johnson intentionally abused and aggressively shook the child because she was angry when the    wouldnâ€™t stop crying Johnson said that the baby suffered an accidental fall from a high chair. Length of imprisonment: Johnson, 71, has been behind bars since she was found guilty in 1999. Cause for review: Johnson is among of slew of criminal defendants convicted in cases of   â€œshaken baby syndromeâ€ a controversial diagnosis for young children injured as a result of forceful shaking. The medical consensus around shaken baby syndrome and childhood head trauma has evolved since Johnsonâ€™s conviction, calling into question her case and many others in which prosecutors alleged childrenâ€™s fatal injuries were caused by intentional abuse. New research suggests that shaken baby syndrome has been over diagnosed and has spurred intense debate over what actually indicates a case of shaken baby syndrome. Johnsonâ€™s attorneys say the childâ€™s, Whatâ€™s next: Johnson is one of 12 defendants for whom the California Innocence Project is asking Governor Jerry Brown to grant clemency. In January, a judge said that Johnson could seek a retrial. The original case: Nathaniel Epps was convicted of rape and other violent crimes with his    Percell Warren in a 1996 attack of a woman in Norfolk, Virginia. Prosecutors said Epps and Warren broke into the womanâ€™s home and raped her at gunpoint before beating her with the pistol. Length of imprisonment: Epps, 53, has served 20 years of a   sentence. Warren died from lung cancer in prison in 2012. Cause for review: Newly tested DNA evidence exonerates both men, according to the Innocence Project. Sperm from two men was found on the victimâ€™s jeans, and Warrenâ€™s DNA was not found in the mixture. Although Eppsâ€™s couldnâ€™t be definitively excluded from the mixture, his lawyers say the evidence exonerates him because of the stateâ€™s theory that Warren and Epps committed the crime together. â€œDNA results excluding at least one of the defendants as the source of the sperm proves that they are both actually innocent,â€ Eppsâ€™s lawyers wrote in a brief presenting the evidence. Whatâ€™s next: The Innocence Project is petitioning the Virginia supreme court for Eppsâ€™s full exoneration. His lawyers submitted a petition to the court on 21 June presenting the new DNA evidence and seeking a writ of innocence. The state attorney generalâ€™s office has 30 days to respond. The original case: Prosecutors said Vinson raped a    girl in her bedroom after breaking into her Detroit home through a window. Length of imprisonment: Vinson has been in prison since May 1986 and is serving a   to   sentence. Cause for review: Vinsonâ€™s legal team at the University of Michigan Innocence Clinic say that newly available DNA testing rule him out as a possible suspect in the rape. Attorney Andrew Fletcher said a new analysis of the semen found at the crime scene definitively showed that Vinson couldnâ€™t have been the attacker. Blood cells in the semen found on sheets at the crime scene show that the attacker was blood type O Vinson is blood type AB. The original case: Contreras and his friend Scott Taylor were convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole in 1997. Prosecutors charged the pair with killing Frederick Walker at a barbecue in Santa Clarita, California. Walkerâ€™s beaten body was found dismembered and in trash bags by police. Length of imprisonment: Contreras has been in prison for 19 years. Cause for review: Contreras and Taylor were convicted after a woman at the barbecue told police that both men were responsible for Walkerâ€™s brutal death, in line with authoritiesâ€™ theory that two killers were responsible. In 2009, the woman, Lisa Garringer, recanted her original testimony and later testified that Taylor was the only person involved involved in Walkerâ€™s death. Garringer said she had been coerced by police investigators into implicating both men. Whatâ€™s next: After Garringerâ€™s new testimony, a Los Angeles superior court judge refused to reverse Contrerasâ€™s conviction, saying he did not find her to be a credible witness. His lawyers at the California Innocence Project say they will continue to seek relief through the courts but that their clientâ€™s best hope for release is through clemency from the

Shortly after the FBI announced Julyâ€™s figures on Monday afternoon, shares in the second largest gun manufacturer hit $30. 59 each. Smith  Wessonâ€™s shares closed the day at an   high of $30. 36, up 3% for the day and beating a previous record high of $29. 37 set in March. Shares in Sturm Ruger, the USâ€™s largest gun maker, also surged on the news, ending the day up 2% at $69. 40. A total of 2, 197, 169 firearms background checks were processed last month, according to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Thatâ€™s up from 1, 600, 832 background checks processed in July 2015 and 891, 224 checks processed in July 2008, months before Barack Obama was elected president.  Firearms background checks are not the most accurate measure of gun sales, as not every background check results in a purchase. Additionally, multiple firearms can be purchased with one background check. The figure is, however, used to gauge the demand for firearms and the health of the market.  The demand for firearms in the US has been on the rise, fuelled by fears of a crackdown on ownership in the wake of a series of mass shootings. July was the 15th month in a row that a new record has been set for that particular time of the year. The   high was reached in December of 2015, right after the San Bernardino terrorist attack that left 14 dead and 22 injured. That month, 3, 314, 594 firearms background checks were performed.

The South Korean company recalled 2. 5m phones last week following reports that some units had caught fire during or after charging. One    from New York was reportedly using a Galaxy Note 7 to watch videos on Saturday when it burst into flames, causing burns to his body.  His grandmother Linda Lewis told the New York Post: â€œHe doesnâ€™t want to see or go near any phones. Heâ€™s been crying to his mother. â€ Samsung has said that battery problems are responsible for the explosions but that it cannot be sure at this stage which of the phones it has sold are affected. In a statement the company introduced a product exchange program that allows all owners to trade their devices for a new one.  â€œWe strongly advise all customers to use this exchange program because your safety is our top priority. Additional sales and shipments of the affected devices have been stopped, but if you already have a Galaxy Note 7, we strongly advise that you replace it. â€ â€œUntil a replacement device is provided, Samsung asks all customers with a Galaxy Note 7 smartphone to power down your device and return it to its place of purchase at your earliest opportunity,â€ the statement added. Users who donâ€™t follow Samsungâ€™s recommendations may find their device, which only launched last month, remotely deactivated. Unconfirmed reports stemming from a Reddit thread have suggested that Samsung will brick affected Note 7s starting as soon as 30 September. Smartphones typically have a remote kill switch to deter   thieves. As a safety measure, airlines across the US started to warn passengers to avoid switching on or charging their Note 7s during flights, in line with advice from the Federal Aviation Authority. Customers can trade their Galaxy Note 7 for a new version of the smartphone that isnâ€™t faulty or they can choose a different model of smartphone, including the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, and receive a refund for the price difference between devices. To sweeten the inconvenience, Samsung is also issuing US customers with a $25 gift card. The companyâ€™s share price has plummeted in response to the recall.  Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.

politifact14788,http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-isis-barron-obama/,"Melania Trump: ‘If ISIS Lay A Finger On Barron, I’ll Scratch Obama’s Eyes Out’","Donald Trump has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration. The Republican presidential candidate doubled down on his hardline stance in a speech on Wednesday night which delighted core supporters and dismayed his few remaining Latino allies who had expected a tack towards moderation. Speaking hours after a lightning visit to Mexico, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, he was sticking with his plan for a â€œdeportation forceâ€ to intercept illegal border crossers and hunt down criminal â€œillegal aliensâ€ already in the US. â€œWe are going to take our country back,â€ he said, repeating a mantra from the primary campaign. Speaking largely from a teleprompter, he also reiterated his vow to make Mexico pay for a   wall which, he said, would bristle with sensors, towers and guards. â€œWe will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They donâ€™t know it yet, but theyâ€™re going to pay for it. â€ Trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls with just 69 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides had recently fuelled expectations of a â€œsofteningâ€ of immigration policy, prompting speculation about a  . Instead the speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City, where Trump met President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. The GOP nominee roused the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage â€œangel momsâ€ whose children were killed. He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gives work permits to about 800, 000 young immigrants who came to the US as children  â€”   a stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach. Anybody who entered the US illegally would be subject to deportation and there should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, he said. â€œThere will be no amnesty. â€ Trump also promised ideological tests for   visa applicants, a â€œsunsetâ€ on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years and a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that donâ€™t deport undocumented immigrants. The rhetoric trampled over the hopes of Trumpâ€™s dwindling band of conservative Latino supporters. â€œThis is how I feel: disappointed and misled,â€ tweeted Alfonso Aguilar, head of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. Jacob Monty, a member of Trumpâ€™s National Hispanic advisory council, resigned, Politico reported. The rightwing columnist Ann Coulter, in contrast, exulted. â€œWow. This doesnâ€™t sound like â€œsoftening. â€ GO, TRUMP! !!â€ she tweeted. Trump did however imply most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would remain untouched while his putative administration focused on deporting 2 million with alleged criminal records. â€œWe will begin moving them out, day one. My first hour in office, those people are gone. â€ The ambiguity over the fate of   undocumented immigrants marked a tacit retreat from Trumpâ€™s earlier vows to swiftly deport all 11 million people. The lack of clarity allowed supporters and critics to fill in the blanks with their own wishes and anxieties. Trumpâ€™s policy could in theory yet resemble that of Obama, who has deported millions, and GOP rivals such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, whom Trump accused of supporting de facto amnesty. The speech capped a whirlwind day of political theatre in which Trump, after a year of denigrating Mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and drug dealers, met President PeÃ±a Nieto in Mexico City, triggering a backlash from Mexicans who denounced the New York businessman as a tyrant, and worse. Trump emerged from the private meeting at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, heaping praise on Mexican immigrants. â€œThey are amazing people, amazing people . .. Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular and hardworking people. â€ He said the   meeting with PeÃ±a Nieto was â€œsubstantiveâ€ and â€œexcellentâ€ but did not touch on his pledge to force Mexico to pay for the wall. â€œWeâ€™re saving that discussion for a later date. â€ Mexicoâ€™s president however said he did broach the topic and told Trump Mexico would not pay. In a late evening television interview, an   PeÃ±a Nieto said: â€œHis policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing. â€œThat risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations. â€  Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, sidelined by another day of Trump drama, seized on the discrepancy: â€œIt turns out Trump didnâ€™t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. â€ The unexpected visit  â€”   Trumpâ€™s first meeting with a head of state since he became a candidate  â€”   yielded presidential optics in the form of a podium and marble backdrop in an international setting. Speaking beneath a Mexican flag the casino   reality TV star sounded restrained and diplomatic. That evaporated when he bounded onto the podium in Phoenix, 200 miles north of the border, and seemed energised by the crowd, even though the cavernous convention centre was  . â€œThere is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that is the wellbeing of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. â€ The audience cheered and chanted â€œUSAâ€. Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, a controversial hunter of suspected undocumented people, New Yorkâ€™s former mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trumpâ€™s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, warmed up the crowd before Trump arrived.  Supporters hailed his   foray as evidence he could negotiate with foreign leaders and secure US interests. George Buchanan, 71, a retired flooring installer, said it also showed courage. â€œItâ€™s dangerous. Youâ€™ve got those Mexican people over there, drug lords. The drug lords donâ€™t want him to build the wall. â€ Some in the crowd sensed that behind the brash reiteration of mass deportations Trump was in fact edging towards a more moderate, viable, policy. â€œI think heâ€™s loosening up, becoming more realistic,â€ said Nancy Lewis, 56, a retired law enforcer. â€œAnd Iâ€™m OK with that. I have Hispanic friends. â€ Michelle Des Marais, 78, appeared willing to forgive Trump if he did end up retreating. â€œItâ€™s a hard fight but at least heâ€™s trying. â€",414,942,"933768952169168896	933770606755053573	933843649657475072	933843698785423360	933932573671153664	934005992026791936	934911980397322241	934912098236329984",fake

Just as pet owners wonder what their pets do all day while theyâ€™re out, pets are baffled as to what their human masters and mistresses find to occupy themselves with during this mysterious time of â€œworkâ€. Max (voiced by Louis CK) is a terrier who is outraged when his owner brings home a new rescue dog that he must now live with: Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet). At first mortal enemies, they become pals when they find themselves collarless and menaced by strays.

politifact14247,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-of-american-moon-landings/,Chinese Lunar Rover Finds No Evidence Of American Moon Landings,"Val Aubrey parked her boat trailer on the shore of Eagle Lake, in   California. She walked to an overlook where a sign warned against swimming and diving. â€œThisâ€  â€”   she opened her arms wide  â€”   â€œused to be the marina. â€ Down below, docks sat among nettles and thistles growing on what used to be the lake bed. The boat ramp led to sunbaked dirt, and squirrels skittered across the concrete.  â€œThey put a tombstone right in the middle of it,â€ said Aubrey, pointing into the undergrowth. Sure enough, a small Halloween decoration had been erected in the former harbor. One of the largest natural lakes in the state, Eagle Lake is a shock of blue amid a tawny, isolated upland. But it has fallen around 15ft since 1999, a decline thought to have been exacerbated by climate change. The main lakeside community of Spalding, a   drive north of the marina, is dotted with â€œfor saleâ€ signs, and its tidy streets are empty. The waterfront is now a meadow, and the lake has receded to a thin strip in the distance, like an alluring mirage. There are no longer any restaurants, and the general store is shuttered. Adding to the air of misfortune, dozens of the wells that supply residents with water have gone dry, necessitating deeper ones. The hardships facing the lake stand in contrast to its reputation as a fishery. According to the outdoors writer Tom Stienstra, â€œIt was among the most prized lakes in America. â€  Its main attraction is the indigenous Eagle Lake rainbow trout, whose   meat is said to be uncommonly delicious. Anglers continue to land big, healthy fish. But half as many of them are visiting, in part because only one boat ramp on the entire,    lake is still operational. â€œGimme water, lord,â€ said Aubrey, a    with a   vibe and a cigarette crackle in her voice. â€œI think thatâ€™s the thought of everyone round here. â€ In the shadow of the disused marina, she backed her trailer down the ramp and into the glassy shallows as chub minnows darted away. There was a thump as the wheels dropped onto the mud at the end, a sign of how close the structure is to being unusable. Aubrey undid some clips, and her   Dream Catcher, floated onto the lake. Chugging out, it was hard to tell that anything was amiss. The unruffled water stretched to sere,   hills and a cloudless sky. White pelicans cruised past like ungainly swans. Grebes emitted tinkling chirps and chuckles, and pairs of them performed a courtship dance in which they lifted themselves off the surface and appeared to run across it. When the boat approached, they dove underwater instead of flying away. Once a fishing guide, Aubrey wore enamel earrings in the shape of trout. â€œThereâ€™s more to Eagle Lake than just fishing,â€ she said. â€œOur hearts are here. Our souls are here. â€ Even so, spurs of dry land have appeared where previously there was none. Aubrey pulled into the lee of a sand bar that had gradually risen out of the waves. â€œBefore this area was above water, this was just black with grebes,â€ she said. Last year, some vast northern sections of the lake almost dried up completely, only to be regenerated, to a certain extent, by the winter rains. They were still too shallow for Dream Catcher.  Back at the marina, operated by a couple named Grace and Scott McCullough, it was lunchtime. With vacationers perusing snacks and fishing lures in the large,   shop, and hot food on offer from a trailer, it felt like the vacation spot that Eagle Lake prides itself on being. Sitting in the storeroom, Grace ticked off some theories sheâ€™d heard to explain the low water. Perhaps someone had bought the rights to the aquifer and was secretly draining it. Maybe   at a neighboring lake was leaving them with less moisture. As she sees it, the decline is part of a normal cycle. Itâ€™s true that California is prone to drought, and Eagle Lakeâ€™s level, determined primarily by precipitation, has oscillated over the decades. Its longtime historic low was in the 1930s, though in 2015 it went lower. At a picnic table outside, there was skepticism as to whether Eagle Lake was at the vanguard of a more ominous,   global shift. â€œIâ€™m not an    believer that we can adjust the climate of this earth that much,â€ said Scott McCullough, a retired marine. â€œI agree with Scott,â€ said Lee Crane, a   dentist from Sacramento, who was eating burgers at the other end of the table with his wife, Dottie. â€œYou could take all the diesel stacks in the United States and let â€˜em go and the earth wouldnâ€™t know the difference, in my opinion. â€ Bobette Jones, an ecologist with the Eagle Lake ranger district, sees it differently. With less snow falling in the area, there is less snowmelt to recharge the watershed, while more dry months each year mean increased evaporation. â€œI think thereâ€™s a pretty strong trend that the lake is definitely going to be much more shallow in the future,â€ she said by telephone. â€œItâ€™s sort of a    and   story, but that is what the data is showing. Hopefully weâ€™re wrong. â€ As evening approached, boat mechanic James Watts was stood in the weedy lot of his repair shop in Spalding. â€œOn opening morning, Iâ€™d have boats lined up down the street,â€ he said, referring to the start of the fishing season. â€œNow as you see there ainâ€™t no boats around here. â€ Watts fell for Eagle Lake on a fishing trip, and his family built the shop over 20 years ago. In 2013, he was forced to move the business to a nearby town, where there was more money to be made. All around him were the   boats he was saving for spares and others he was storing for acquaintances. Almost the only sound was the shushing of wind through the trees. â€œWe watched the water level go and every year it was like, donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll come back, itâ€™ll come back. And three years ago was when it actually turned and went to nothing. â€ Wearing a grimy work shirt bearing his name, Watts lit a cigarette, leaned against one of the hulls, and stared into space.

politifact15232,daily-vine.com/cnn-pulls-plug/,WHOA! YouTube Witness Makes SHOCKING Admission On LIVE TV! CNN PULLS PLUG IMMEDIATELY! — ShareRED,"The Chilcot inquiry has delivered a damning verdict on the decision by former prime minister Tony Blair to commit British troops to the   invasion of Iraq in 2003. It says: Chilcot is withering about Blairâ€™s choice to join the US invasion. He says: â€œWe have concluded that the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. Military action at that time was not a last resort. â€ Chilcot finds that Blair deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by the Iraqi regime as he sought to make the case for military action to MPs and the public in the buildup to the invasion in 2002 and 2003. The then prime minister disregarded warnings about the potential consequences of military action, and relied too heavily on his own beliefs, rather than the more nuanced judgments of the intelligence services. â€œThe judgments about Iraqâ€™s capabilities . .. were presented with a certainty that was not justified,â€ the report says. Tony Blair wrote to George W Bush eight months before the Iraq invasion to offer his unqualified backing for war well before UN weapons inspectors had complete their work, saying: â€œI will be with you, whatever. â€ In a   memo marked secret and personal, the then British prime minister told Bush, US president at the time, in July 2002 that the removal of Saddam Hussein would â€œfree up the regionâ€ even if Iraqis may â€œfeel ambivalent about being invadedâ€. It was one of 29 letters Blair sent to Bush in the   to the Iraq war, during the conflict and in its devastating aftermath, released on Wednesday as part of the Chilcot report. Chilcot finds that the decision made by Tony Blairâ€™s cabinetâ€™s to invade was made in circumstances that were â€œfar from satisfactoryâ€. The inquiry did not reach a view on the legality of the war, saying this could only be assessed by a â€œproperly constituted and internationally recognised courtâ€ but did make a damning assessment of how the decision was made. The process for deciding that the war was legal is described as â€œperfunctoryâ€ by the inquiry, while â€œno formal record was made of that decision, and the precise grounds on which it was made remains unclearâ€. The inquiry found that the Bush administration repeatedly   advice from the UK on how to oversee Iraq after the invasion, including the involvement of the United Nations, the control of Iraqi oil money and the extent to which better security should be put at the heart of the military operation. The inquiry specifically criticises the way in which the US dismantled the security apparatus of the Saddam Hussein army and describes the whole invasion as a strategic failure. Iran, North Korea and Libya were considered greater threats in terms of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation, and the UK joint intelligence committee believed it would take Iraq five years, after the lifting of sanctions, to produce enough fissile material for a weapon, Chilcot finds. Britainâ€™s previous strategy of containment could have been adopted and continued for some time. The Chilcot report identifies a series of major blunders by the British intelligence services that produced â€œflawedâ€ information about Saddamâ€™s alleged weapons of mass destruction, the basis for going to war. Chilcot says the intelligence community worked from the start on the misguided assumption that Saddam had WMDs and made no attempt to consider the possibility that he had got rid of them, which he had. The UKâ€™s military involvement in Iraq ended with the â€œhumiliatingâ€ decision to strike deals with enemy militias because British forces were seriously   and there was â€œwholly inadequateâ€ planning and preparation for life after Saddam Hussein, the Chilcot report finds. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) planned the invasion in a rush and was slow to react to the security threats on the ground, particularly the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that killed so many troops, the report says. Chilcot rejects the view that the UK would have lost diplomatic influence if it had refused to join the war. â€œBlair was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider alliance with the US very carefully,â€ the report says. But it adds: â€œIf the UK had refused to join the US in the war it would not have led to a fundamental or lasting change in the UKâ€™s relationship with the US. â€ The report says that between early 2002 and March 2003 Blair was told that,   Iraq could degenerate into civil war. In September 2002, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, predicted â€œa terrible bloodletting of revenge after Saddam goesâ€ adding: â€œTraditional in Iraq after conflict. â€ Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador to the US, added: â€œIt will probably make pacifying Afghanistan look like childâ€™s play. â€ Chilcot rejects Blairâ€™s claim that the subsequent chaos and sectarian conflict could not have been predicted. According to Chilcot, Blair did not identify which ministers were responsible for postwar planning and strategy. The prime minister also failed to press Bush for â€œdefinitive assurancesâ€ about the USâ€™s   plans. Nor did he envisage anything other than the   scenario once the invasion was over: that a   and   force would find itself operating in a â€œrelatively benign security environmentâ€. All of this contributed to Britainâ€™s ultimate strategic failure. The Bush administration appointed ambassador Paul Bremer to head a new coalition provisional authority in Baghdad. The UK had practically no input into subsequent decisions taken by Bremer, including the dissolving of Saddamâ€™s army and security structures. This decision alienated the Sunni community and fed the insurgency. Blair continued to talk to Bush, but Britain had little influence on the ground over    policymaking.  Chilcot says that by 2009, when UK forces were pulled out of Iraq, Downing Street was facing strategic failure. Iraq was gripped by â€œdeep sectarian divisionsâ€. There was a fragile situation in Basra, rows over oil revenues, and rampant corruption inside Iraqi government ministries. No evidence had been found that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. During this period the government did not reappraise the situation, Chilcot says. He describes as â€œmeagreâ€ the results of Britainâ€™s costly   occupation. Before the war, Blair had said that the   invasion coalition would try to minimise civilian casualties. As the war and occupation unfolded, however, the MoD made only a â€œbroad estimateâ€ of how many Iraqis were being killed. The report says that more time was devoted to which department should have responsibility for the issue than was spent on finding out the number. The governmentâ€™s main interest was to â€œrebut accusations that coalition forces were responsible for the deaths of large numbersâ€ of Iraqis.",748,479,"981531924417204229	981531935380996097	981533666886242304	981533915692392453	981534821628473344	981540624724733952	981545386400796674	981556667736383493	981567647228801025	981576525102403584	981675342451556352	981677845578645506	982117453776879617	982721646829146113	982749128437452800	983886038463602688	1045480707806572544",fake

The actor, who played Carrie Bradshaw in the hit television comedy and two films, said she and her   from the series had not ruled out reprising their roles. â€œI donâ€™t think any of us have said no,â€ she told the Press Association. â€œI donâ€™t know whether itâ€™s a series or the movie. â€œI think that remains an open question and discussion that will continue until itâ€™s been resolved. â€œI think thatâ€™s always a possibility, definitely. â€ Parker starred alongside Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon in the TV series Sex and the city from 1998 to 2004. The four women reprised their roles for the Sex and the City movie in 2008 and a sequel in 2012. Parker is now starring in a new TV comedy, Divorce, opposite Thomas Haden Church, in which they play a couple whose marriage is breaking down. The show, which will air on Sky Atlantic in the UK, was created by Sharon Horgan, the Irish writer and star of hit Amazon comedy Catastrophe. Parker, who has been married to actor Matthew Broderick for 19 years, said she knew of a couple involved in an affair which lasted â€œmany, many yearsâ€ despite both of them being â€œhappily married peopleâ€. â€œThis affair was sort of like an alternate universe but it wasnâ€™t hurting anybody,â€ she said. â€œI was so curious because I didnâ€™t think it was unique. â€œI hadnâ€™t seen in cinema for a long time, a portrait of a marriage   a   marriage in a lot of ways   that was inhabited by people we all know and see on the subway or the metro or the train or in a car next to us. â€ Divorce can be seen on Sky Atlantic from October 11.",282,846,"983556876423061506	983562862554730496	983571550522654720	983574268188426240	983576885853433856	983583938215018497	983588920490209281	983604581010731008	983610719873748992	983628867775746048	983645054798565377	983652000305856512	983652143637774336	983656422704545792	983657775963127809	983660404147736576	983663000119861248	983664282964561920	983664877947547648	983664921849356288	983666570508500992	983666985987911680	983668498793512962	983676168258793472	983676183010336768	983684719446495232	983689374515818496	983689577352351744	983690144019599360	983694129799618560	983707824839684096	983707824768323584	983719868624064515	983721231663837184	983744036828835840	983746297281818624	983755267547557889	983755388947451905	983756932203806722	983758022639017984	983760370694270977	983760879639519234	983771394570768385	983776165151289344	983780790411538432	983781335327215618	983782485418037248	983783270973308933	983789325199409152	983790796729184257	983794668314836992	983800711983935488	983805445478469633	983808112778936322	983811241725612033	983815316001173505	983823623046737921	983826198286479361	983838347763204097	983839426924220417	983843927433216001	983862548276629504	983864057823457280	983873933819641856	983879323143868416	983884434008133633	983890157517574144	983892652893638656	983917058646831104	983923364485005313	983932051727433729	983939191145811969	983943572457119744	983945571185524737	983951464895827973	983951950860505088	983962994517463041	983966562783641600	983977901883297792	984022384784105473	984022544473837568	984043833745969152	984046068336857089	984052622759006208	984068921757261824	984070103963586560	984071592249569283	984080415718805504	984090193790734336	984090215718498304	984092735710879744	984095250669907968	984095682997968897	984102842242945025	984107913160556544	984111994503647232	984116648293650438	984116816397193216	984117169234612224	984117478614880257	984128309473800194	984129921898364928	984134612715794437	984167853724139522	984173773946437632	984181666041102337	984205450576105477	984253956741320704	984257723347996672	984271226922328064	984361584779776001	984366199470460928	984405311476912129	984413887968763905	984426095264108544	984430982521503744	984527487060262912	984757074574880768	984868004432408576	986788346394435585",fake
politifact15334,yournewswire.com/smallville-star-sold-children-rothschilds-clintons/,‘Smallville’ Star Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons,"With his second    endeavor, The   Adam Sandler has found a way to warp time. No, the story does not offer useful guidelines on how one can revert to oneâ€™s youth, as the title suggests, but creates a set and setting in which time magically moves at a fraction of the normal rate. Surely this movie must be almost over, you think, as you jab the pause button on your remote  â€”   only to find you are at the   mark with another 58 to go. Itâ€™s a remarkable feat, as so little else in this picture has anything noteworthy happening at all. It starts out simple, but moderately amusing. Charlie McMillan (David Spade) is a milquetoast loser who bumps into his old, cooler friend Max Kessler (Sandler) at a high school reunion. McMillan wears the same nerdy clothes and drives the same awful car and even holds the same humiliating job he did in high school: working in a bank inside a supermarket. (Old ladies ask him where they can find kitty litter. After explaining, again, that the bank is independent from the market, he sighs, reduced to his fate: aisle two.) McMillan is stuck in a rut. His faithless wife is still shacking up with her ex, but McMillan is raising their bratty twin sons. Kessler, a slightly toned down version of Sandlerâ€™s   jerk persona as seen in Thatâ€™s My Boy (a film some are brave enough to admit is not that bad) convinces McMillan to come hang out on his yacht one weekend. (Kessler works for the FBI, so heâ€™s got a boat. Why not?) After introducing a Bud Light Party Ball (â€œPut your ear next to it and you can still hear someone puking at a Def Leppard concert! â€) the pair unwind. A musical montage of fun includes shouting â€œShow us your tits!â€ to a neighboring boat of (in the parlance of the film) â€œhottiesâ€ who comply, then respond: â€œShow us your dick!â€ The ladies take one look at what McMillan is packing and shout â€œBoo!â€ so Kessler fires a flare at them, forcing them to dive overboard.  This is, depending on your point of view,     ribbing or gross male hostility. Whatever your decision, know this: it comes during the â€œgoodâ€   and   part of the movie. (Unlike director Steven Brillâ€™s last picture, the quite spry Blake   Elizabeth Banks vehicle Walk of Shame, The   becomes completely unraveled once things get complicated.) Kessler has a plan, you see. He blows up the boat, enabling the two to fake their own death. Wonâ€™t authorities look for bodies? They will but, as it turns out, Kessler doesnâ€™t work for the FBI  â€”   he is a coroner, and had access to two   corpses that no one will miss. Kessler and McMillan can assume their identities and start a new life. Kessler maxed out his credit cards and has enough dough for them to float for a while, but there was also a safety deposit box in the rectum of one of the two men, you see. This leads to an enormous cache of cash and the keys to a mansion in Puerto Rico. â€œThereâ€™s like five houses in this house!â€ McMillan (now called Dr Fishman) shouts with glee. On permanent vacation (â€œPlay Who Let The Dogs Out!â€ McMillan drunkenly suggests at a resort bar) thereâ€™s dancing and hookups, one of which involves a bit of homosexual panic when sweat from Luis GuzmÃ¡nâ€™s scrotum drips all over David Spadeâ€™s glasses. The gay jokes (and there are many) come encased in layers of â€œnot that thereâ€™s anything wrong with it!â€ disclaimers, but one has to wonder why this is such a recurring theme. Another source for yuks: libidinal geriatric RenÃ©e Taylor, whose topless scene will similarly land as either cruel or â€œall in good funâ€ depending on where your personal line is drawn. The frivolity comes to an end, though when an acrobatic German hitman comes calling. I mean, they are living in luxury in the Caribbean, clearly the men whose lives our heroes stole are involved in either drugs or weapons, so the second half of the movie becomes a     actioner. The plot, which now involves the real Dr Fishmanâ€™s widow (Paula Patton) is convoluted, but itâ€™s not worth worrying too much about. Itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re curing cancer. Oh, but they are! In a   reveal itâ€™s discovered that our two doofuses have stumbled into an enormous corporate conspiracy to repress a miracle cancer drug. No amount of shouting â€œdo over!â€ at the screen can turn the plot around, as it suddenly becomes a   thriller to save mankind. With Sandler and Spade. On a    budget. Despite an idiocy metastasized into the marrow of its script impervious to any radiation, there is, as with many of Sandlerâ€™s productions, at least something of an upbeat quality to its reprehensibility. While scoping out his own funeral he sees an Asian man. â€œMy dry cleaner showed up?â€ Itâ€™s a creaky, racist joke, but then thereâ€™s the  . â€œI didnâ€™t see that one coming,â€ he mumbles.

politifact15554,https://conservativepost.com/maxine-waters-is-getting-criminally-charged/,Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!,"On Thursday, HBO announced a new crop of standup specials to air next year, including hours from Jerrod Carmichael, Pete Holmes and TJ Miller. It comes only a few days after Netflix announced the imminent release of eight new specials, bringing the siteâ€™s total to over two dozen for 2016. Comics include current Saturday Night Live star Michael Che and former SNL star Dana Carvey. This fall will also see a new special from Martin Lawrence on Showtime, his first in 14 years, and a Doug Stanhope hour on NBCâ€™s newish streaming service, Seeso. HBO and Showtime have been producing specials for years, and theyâ€™ve become a major focus for both Netflix and Seeso, and for good reason. Theyâ€™re relatively cheap to produce, attract a young male audience who advertisers covet, and can stay popular for years. And while the prestige of TV lingers, the really important thing is making them available online comics want their material available for new fans to discover. For younger comics, streaming sites increasingly serve as archives of old material (most of Aziz Ansariâ€™s back catalog can be found on Netflix). Not so long ago, doing regular comedy specials was for the privileged few  â€”   George Carlinâ€™s annual HBO specials were a sign of his exalted status. For a rising comic, doing a special is a sign of arriving â€œgetting an hourâ€ signals that you have some degree of talent, fame and bankability. This is mostly due to the way US comics put together material. In the UK, a comedianâ€™s year revolves around producing a show for the Edinburgh Fringe in August, while in Australia, a comic is likely to work toward an hour for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in March. No such central festival exists in the States comedians build up materially slowly through short sets, spinning them into longer routines as they tour around the country. Without a specific deadline to submit a show, material gets honed tighter and tighter over the years, and a special every two to three years is common for most successful comedians. There are, of course, exceptions  â€”   Louis CK has attempted an hour ever year for the past decade. Generally, comedians with looser, more conversational material churn them out more frequently, while precise, dense writers tend to wait longer  â€”   Steven Wright, the king of   has released only two specials in his   career. And for most comics, recording a special means putting that material to bed. Itâ€™s spent it can never be done again on television, and those jokes are phased out of live performances. Thatâ€™s why, for some very successful touring comedians, recording a special holds little appeal. Jerry Seinfeld hasnâ€™t recorded a special since 1998â€™s Iâ€™m Telling You for the Last Time, but heâ€™s been performing standup regularly since then. During his recent run of NYC shows, he told stories about his children as toddlers, even though theyâ€™re now teenagers, a sign that those jokes were probably a decade old. But it doesnâ€™t matter he can keep telling them as he tours the country, and the odds are that most of his audience wonâ€™t have heard them.  Lawrence, on the other hand, has good reason to invest his time in a special. Fresh from a nationwide arena tour, heâ€™ll soon be promoting the third Bad Boys movie, set for a 2018 release, and heâ€™ll be hoping to revive the fanbase he built as a popular standup and sitcom star in the 1990s. With his special on rotation at Showtime, he can prove his relevance in modern comedy.  Some have criticized Netflix for not including more women, but thereâ€™s also narrowness to their ages Che is the only comic on the list under 40. It may be that younger comics are drawn more toward television specials, which allow them to build relationships with networks that could lead to more work, or to producing albums with smaller labels like A Special Thing and Rooftop Comedy, which give them the option of selling CDs as merchandise.  There is now more standup available online than anyone could possibly consume, and while some of itâ€™s excellent, devout comedy fans will know that, when the last comedy boom died in the early 90s, many blamed the proliferation of free standup on television for diluting the product and discouraging people from going out to live shows. Itâ€™s too early to say whether the expansion of streaming content will have the same effect, but when more than 10 new standup specials are announced in the same week, it certainly seems plausible.

The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, received his briefing earlier this month, a customary move for major party nominees but one that has been the subject of a political tussle during the campaign. Some critics and opponents of Trump have questioned whether he is capable of handling sensitive information responsibly some of Clintonâ€™s critics say her use of a private email server while secretary of state raises concern over her ability to protect classified information. Clinton attended her briefing for more than two hours at the FBI office in White Plains, New York, near her suburban home. As Barack Obamaâ€™s secretary of state, she held a high security clearance and received a copy of the presidentâ€™s daily brief, the   US intelligence document that includes sensitive intelligence and analysis from around the world. Saturdayâ€™s briefing was her first since becoming her partyâ€™s nominee and no aides were present, her campaign said. Trump was accompanied to his briefing by retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn and New Jersey governor Chris Christie. The briefings, which are delivered by career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, have been traditional for presidential nominees for more than 60 years, to ensure a smooth transition for the next commander in chief.  Trump was campaigning on Saturday, headlining the Republican senator Joni Ernstâ€™s annual â€œRoast and Rideâ€ fundraiser at the Iowa state fairgrounds in Des Moines. The businessman was not planning to join a   motorcycle ride that is part of the event but nonetheless brought his campaign to a state where polls show a tight contest, rare good news for Republicans in battleground states. In an interview with the Associated Press, Iowaâ€™s Republican governor, Terry Branstad, said he would like Trump to focus his message more on a renewable fuel standard that is important to his stateâ€™s corn farmers. Trump and Clinton are polling â€œabout evenâ€ in the state, Branstad said, adding that he would like Trump to launch campaign ads in Iowa since Clinton has already done so. â€œI donâ€™t like that, but hopefully thatâ€™s going to change,â€ he

politifact13496,http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston,The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads,"Hillary Clinton hinted at a possible landslide in the 8 November election, exhorting several thousand supporters at a San Francisco fundraiser on Thursday to help her â€œhave the kind of victory we needâ€ to serve as a â€œrebukeâ€ to Donald Trump. On a day when Trump went on the attack  â€”   calling women who have accused him of inappropriate touching and kissing â€œhorrible, horrible liarsâ€  â€”   an increasingly confident Clinton encouraged her backers to double down on their efforts during the final weeks of the fractious 2016 campaign.  â€œEverything we care about is at risk,â€ she said. â€œIf you can help me to have the kind of victory we need, that stands as a rebuke of all the bigotry and bullying weâ€™ve seen, then together, together we will build the future that all of us, particularly the children of our country, deserve to have. â€ Just one day earlier, the floodgates began to open up on Trump, as women accused him of putting his hands up a womanâ€™s skirt on an airplane, shoving his tongue down a reporterâ€™s throat at his    property in Florida, bursting into beauty pageant dressing rooms and ogling the   contestants. Not one but two incidents from 1992 surfaced in which the Republican standard bearer  â€”   then 46  â€”   told young girls that he would be dating them in the    future.  During the San Francisco fundraiser, Clinton rued that â€œthe disturbing stories just keep comingâ€. â€œThe whole world has heard Trump brag about how he mistreats women,â€ Clinton said. â€œBut itâ€™s more than just the way he degrades women, as horrible as that is. He has attacked immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims and our military, which heâ€™s called a disaster. â€œThereâ€™s hardly any part of America that he has not targeted,â€ she continued. â€œNow, it makes you want to turn off the news. It makes you want to unplug the internet. Or just look at cat gifs. Believe me, I get it. In the last few weeks, Iâ€™ve watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things. â€ Clintonâ€™s poll numbers have improved since the recent scandals broke. RealClear Politicsâ€™ running average of national surveys has Clinton ahead by 6. 7 points in a   race.  Still, in the next 26 days, she said, â€œWeâ€™ve got a job to do. â€ Her Republican challenger batted away accusations on Wednesday and Thursday, threatened to sue the New York Times and blamed negative stories on a conspiracy between Clinton and the media. Clinton, in contrast, talked about job growth and healing the nation at rallies in Nevada and Colorado and smaller events in San Francisco. In Pueblo, Colorado, on Wednesday, she commiserated with a protester who tried to shout her down: â€œGotta feel a little sorry for them. Theyâ€™ve had a bad couple of weeks. â€ But she also talked during this west coast swing about how hard it has been to focus on important policy matters when running against a candidate like Trump  â€”   a man who has polarized the nation and his own party for months and fought against allegations of sexual impropriety for the past week. â€œAs negative as this campaign has become, because of the person who achieved the nomination on the other side, you cannot talk about what we should do to make sure that every child has preschool education,â€ Clinton said Thursday afternoon. â€œWe havenâ€™t had a chance to talk about how weâ€™re going to fix what doesnâ€™t work with the Affordable Care Act,â€ she continued. â€œWe havenâ€™t gotten a chance to talk about how weâ€™re going to defend womenâ€™s rights and Planned Parenthood, gay rights . .. voter rights . .. disability rights   â€¦     workersâ€™ rights   â€¦     And we havenâ€™t had much of a chance to talk about how I intend to take on the gun lobby. â€ Throughout the day Thursday, she lauded her volunteers and talked up her ground operation, the critical network of phone banks, neighborhood organizers and     efforts. That detailed organization is a Clinton hallmark but sorely lacking in the Trump campaign.  And she contrasted Trumpâ€™s â€œ  attacksâ€ with the soaring speech Michelle Obama gave on her behalf on Thursday. â€œIf you havenâ€™t seen it,â€ Clinton said, â€œyou need to see her speech in New Hampshire. â€ In fact, Obamaâ€™s oratory was a Clinton campaign highlight Thursday, a   widely tweeted and overwhelmingly celebrated defense of girlsâ€™ and womenâ€™s rights not to be demeaned or assaulted by anyone, not a construction worker on the street or the man who would be president. â€œI canâ€™t believe that Iâ€™m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,â€ Obama said, her voice shaking with emotion. â€œAnd I have to tell you that I canâ€™t stop thinking about this.

The move inspired much heated   rhetoric as the 1 October deadline drew near  â€”   chiefly from a group of US Republican governors, who backed unsuccessful   court action to delay the transition on the grounds that it wasnâ€™t in US interests. They failed. â€œStewardshipâ€ of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana) has now moved away from the National Telecommunications and Information Association (NTIA)  â€”   a branch of the US Department of Commerce  â€”   and over to an international â€œ  communityâ€. So has America really â€œgiven awayâ€ control of the internet? Some of the most public statements opposing the move came from a group of Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley, Ted Cruz and Roy Blunt.  â€œIt is profoundly disappointing that the Obama administration has decided to press on with its plan to relinquish United States oversight of crucial internet functions, even though Congress has not given its approval,â€ they said.  â€œFor years, there has been a bipartisan understanding that the Icann transition is premature and that critical questions remain unanswered about the influence of authoritarian regimes in internet governance, the protection of free speech, the effect on national security, and impacts on consumers, just to name a few. â€ However, many key players and analysts suggest that the newly implemented governance model for Icann (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) will actually strengthen the ability of the global community to challenge contentious decisions and ensure that control of the global internet address book never falls into the wrong hands. The NTIA, which is now out of the internet stewardship business, provided a detailed public assessment of the impact of the change in a statement on its NTIA website in August, detailing why it would be hard for a group of â€œbad actorsâ€ to take control of the process of managing internet names. â€œThe communityâ€™s new powers to challenge board decisions and enforce decisions in court protect against any one party or group of interests from inappropriately influencing Icann,â€ it stated. â€œIn conducting the review of the transition proposal, NTIA also retained an expert panel of corporate governance experts who reviewed the Icann accountability proposal, including assessing any risk of capture. In their assessment, the experts found the prospects for a takeover of Icann by a single government, a group of governments, or one or more economic actors to be extremely remote. â€ Dr Olivier MJ   who was a member of an Icann working group that developed the transition proposal, said the new arrangement also provides real teeth for resolving disputes.  â€œIt is a real improvement on the prior structure,â€ he said. â€œThe ability to overrule the Icann board was seen as a very important development because it was the solution to overturn decisions that might be taken by a rogue board, should it ever happen to become rogue in the future. â€ He said that   â€œgolden  â€ have been introduced that canâ€™t be changed solely by the board. â€œThe key to all of these   is to make sure that Icann, the organisation, is as stable as possible, as accountable as possible and as   as possible. â€ The symbolism of the move  â€”   not lost on activist Republicans  â€”   is as important as the practical changes in who controls the internet. The internet, and internet business, has steadily become more global and more critical to the lives of many people on the planet. With this gradual change came increasing pressure on the US to relinquish some managerial control. After many years of painstaking negotiation and diplomacy, that has now happened  â€”   though internet users wonâ€™t notice any difference at all. â€œThe function that was assumed by the US Department of Commerce was primarily a technical function and this has been replaced by a new set of service level expectations which are actually higher than any other prior agreements,â€ said  . â€œAs a result, the quality of service that will be offered by the Iana functions operator will be better than at any previous time in the history of the internet. â€ Milton Mueller, professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy and a principal of the Internet Governance Project, said that the real story of the Iana transition is that it provides a great example of how to create a global governance model.  â€œThe overall positive outcome is that weâ€™re creating a global governance regime that matches the global scope of the internet and we can extract ourselves from all the existing arrangements that are related to nation states,â€ he said. â€œWe donâ€™t want to put it into the intergovernmental politics of the UN.

politifact14810,http://news.groopspeak.com/breaking-federal-judge-grants-permission-to-subpoena-trump/,BREAKING: Federal Judge Grants Permission To Subpoena Trump,"We often hear the squeals of discontent from certain sections of the internet not known for their forbearance, but one that has recently (as we say in nerd parlance) â€œrustled my jimmiesâ€ is the very     of â€œnerd appropriationâ€. â€œWhy are these cultural hipsters trying to appropriate   cultures?â€ cried a Reddit user. 2016 appeared to be the year where everyone was convinced they were the underdog. It wasnâ€™t limited to online discourse or popular culture, either. Without so many people being convinced  â€”   being sold  â€”   that they were hard done by, we wouldnâ€™t have a Brexit, a Trump presidency, and perhaps the United Nations wouldnâ€™t be categorising Australiaâ€™s treatment of asylum seekers as violating the UN Convention Against Torture and in breach of international law. Thereâ€™s no doubt some people have lost out during three decades of neoliberal policies, itâ€™s just that many of the people shouting the loudest arenâ€™t among them. And so it is with nerd culture too.  Neuroscientist, former   advocate, and Big Bang Theory actor Mayim Bialik released a video blog called â€œHurts To Be Differentâ€ in which she complains about how hard it is to be a nerd. She argues that while â€œgeekâ€ and â€œnerdâ€ may be fashionable labels now, it doesnâ€™t make it any less hard to live the life of a quirky smart person interested in quirky smart person things, in a world of â€œcool kidsâ€. She mentions how different she is at least six times. The term â€œnerdsploitationâ€ was coined to describe alleged parallels with   exploitation films of the grindhouses and   of the past. It refers to engagement with subject material that cannot be described as being in good faith. We are laughing at the players in the film, not with them.  The conversation surrounding this term started gaining in popularity around 2013 with the release of a video questioning the ethics of the representation of geeky and nerdy stereotypes in reality shows and films. By presenting â€œnerdâ€ as an identity, Bialik and others are trying to attach themselves and the community to identity politics where oneâ€™s experiences (and oppression) inform their politics. But this only works if your identity actually is oppressed. Itâ€™s quite the misdirection. Not only is a little nerdery mainstream now, itâ€™s damn profitable and sends her  â€”   and anyone else starring in the latest works about nerds, geeks, outcasts or superheroes  â€”   a lot of big fat cheques. â€œNerdâ€ has reached a capitalist crescendo. Trying to shoehorn nerddom into identity politics shows callous ignorance for the systemic and daily oppression faced by genuinely marginalised people. Nerds arenâ€™t rejected for work, ignored by the courts or legislation or erased from popular culture. Despite this lack of actual oppression, terms like â€œnerdsploitationâ€ and  â€”   itâ€™s almost hard to believe  â€”   â€œnerd blackfaceâ€ are emerging. Letâ€™s be clear, nerds: you havenâ€™t faced centuries of racial oppression, violence, cultural appropriation or systemic discrimination for who you are. Cops arenâ€™t shooting you when your car breaks down because you can speak Klingon.  When we peel back why people feel defensive, bitter, or keen to take on the visage of the underdog, we can see what it really is: neediness. A desperate need to have our world view and choices validated. To have our sprawling mental databases of knowledge about our favourite media valued by others, even when those others can now quickly search their phones for such information. The good news is, if we let go of this persecution complex we can see that everyone is nerdy about something. If weâ€™re lucky enough, and open enough, we get to see someone in full flight talking about what they love. It truly is a thing of beauty, and if youâ€™re too needy about finding personal validation, youâ€™re going to miss your glimpse of it. Finding people who love the media you love has literally never been easier. Thereâ€™s an internet corner for every obscure fandom out there, wiki pages for the most complex of fantasy lore, and forums dedicated to teaching you how to make the best cosplay to pay homage to your favourite character.  We nerds are not as lonely as we once were, and we have to stop being afraid of acknowledging that lest we lose underdog status. Being into nerdy stuff can be awesome. Being nerdy about stuff is awesome. Find your people. Excise the gross ones. Share your passions proudly and with   enthusiasm.

politifact14749,https://100percentfedup.com/just-wapo-reporter-broke-news-judge-roy-moore-story-criminal-history-faking/,JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of “Faking” * 100PercentFedUp.com," The Great Indoors, The funniest joke in this new sitcom about a wilderness reporter who takes a job working at the digital department of an outdoors magazine is that there is a job at a magazine. Hahaha. There are no jobs in media anymore. Luckily, said reporter is played by Communityâ€™s Joel McHale playing a Gen   who canâ€™t deal with his millennial colleagues, who never leave their computer screens. Expect lots of â€œOh, kids todayâ€ jokes. With Stephen Fry and Superbadâ€™s Christopher   along for the ride, the cast is the main reason to tune in. CBS, Thursday 27 October at 8. 30pm ET, Tracey Ullmanâ€™s Show, For fans of the comedian, who has been doing a rogueâ€™s gallery of original characters and impersonations on US television for the past three decades, they will be happy that sheâ€™s back. This series actually ran in the UK back in January and it was the first time she had made something for British telly in 30 years. Sadly, it wasnâ€™t very well received. â€œItâ€™s not brave or funny enough, like a step backwards from Little Britain, 10 years after Little Britain,â€ the Guardianâ€™s Sam Wollaston wrote of the show. Ouch! At least her impressions of Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are spot on. HBO, Friday, 28 October at 11pm ET, Itâ€™s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, Before everyone was obsessed with dressing up as someone from this yearâ€™s election (sorry, your Melania Trump costume idea is not original no matter how you do it) we were all obsessed with the    Peanuts holiday special. You know, the one where Linus waits out in a pumpkin patch all night convinced that the spirit of Halloween will come and scare the bejesus out of him. Watch it again or introduce someone a bit younger to the tradition. Itâ€™s paired with a   cartoon from Snoopy and the gang called Youâ€™re Not Elected, Charlie Brown. God, is everyone obsessed with politics right now? ABC, Friday 28 October 28, at 8pm ET,  Good Girls Revolt  Imagine if Mad Men were only about Peggy Olson and it focused on the newspapers that carried the ads rather than the ads themselves. Oh, and itâ€™s based on true events. Then youâ€™d have Good Girls Revolt, Amazonâ€™s newest show, inspired by a real lawsuit in which female journalists at Newsweek sued their bosses in the 60s over equal treatment in the newsroom. (Thereâ€™s even a book written about it in case the Amazon show convinces you to make an Amazon order.) Anna Camp, Genevieve Angelson and Erin Darke play the women who square off against their sexist boss (Jim Belushi). Mamie Gummer has a small role as Nora Ephron, who worked at the magazine before she become a Hollywood legend. Amazon, Friday 28 October, Rectify, There used to be a promo for this show that ran on Sundance TV in which the main character, Daniel Holden (Aden Young) was lying in a bathtub watching water drip out of the drain. That is a perfect way to encapsulate this moody, moving, brilliant show that sometimes moves more slowly than a slug on a heavy dose of sedatives. Daniel is released from death row after 20 years when some DNA evidence suggests he may not have raped and murdered his high school girlfriend. The fourth and final season of this drama follows Danielâ€™s long journey trying to acclimate to the world and his family trying to acclimate to him.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa) says the cityâ€™s main transit agency and the union representing about 4, 700 workers reached an agreement early Monday. Septa board chairman Pasquale Deon said it is a fair deal that provides â€œwage increases, pension improvements, and maintains healthcare coverage levels while addressing rising costsâ€. The deal is still subject to ratification by union members and must be approved by the Septa board. Officials said subway service would be the first to return and that some bus service could be available in time for the evening rush, but that it usually would take 24 hours for full service to return. The workers with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority walked out after midnight on Tuesday, 1 November, over issues including pension benefits and the amount of time off given to drivers between shifts. The result has been traffic gridlock at morning and evening rush hours jammed and delayed regional rail service and higher absenteeism at the cityâ€™s high schools. Some officials were concerned that the strike could dampen voter turnout if it continued through election day. The city of Philadelphia had filed a motion in state court seeking an injunction to temporarily halt the strike for election day so residents can get to the polls to vote. The court had been expected to hear the cityâ€™s motion Monday morning. Democratic city leaders had worried that if the strike continued through election day, some voters wouldnâ€™t have been able to get to the polls because they will be spending so much time getting to and from work. Pennsylvania is a battleground state, and the vote in overwhelmingly Democratic Philadelphia is critically important to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as she battles Republican Donald Trump. Democratic governor Tom Wolf on Sunday said he intended to file a legal document in support of an injunction request filed by Septa. The transit agency argues the walkout endangers public health and safety as well as the right of residents to vote in Tuesdayâ€™s general election. The union has accused Septa of relying on the courts to end the strike rather than bargaining. â€œThe strike has been devastating for so many individuals and their families and has created extreme hardships for the city and for businesses,â€ Wolf said in a statement. â€œThe time for it to end is now. â€ The walkout is the ninth since 1975 by the city transit union. The last one, in 2009, lasted six days, but some have lasted for weeks.

Port Authority police said they received reports of shots fired at Terminal 8 near the departures area at about 9. 30pm on Sunday (1. 30am BST). Police said they closed Terminal 1 following additional reports of shots fired. However, in a briefing early on Monday, Joe Pentangelo, a Port Authority spokesman, said: â€œAt this time, no firearm, rounds, shell casings or other evidence of shots fired has been found. â€ The New York police departmentâ€™s head of special operations tweeted that nothing suspicious had been found in a search of the terminals.  A senior law enforcement official told NBC the security alert had been triggered when a woman coming off a plane reported hearing gunshots in Terminal 8.  One official said the noise could have been cheering and banging while passengers watched the Olympics.  The security alert led to travel chaos for thousands. The Federal Aviation Administration announced a â€œfull ground stopâ€ on all air traffic arriving at JFK until 11. 30pm. Some flights were diverted and tracking website Flightradar said delays in the area were increasing. An expressway approaching JFK also was shut down. Passengers were allowed back into some terminals and flights began departing again at about midnight. Images posted on social media during the evacuation showed scores of people standing outside the terminals.  Travellers who had been evacuated said police told them it was â€œnot safeâ€ to stay inside.  People inside Terminal 8 described panic when the evacuation order was given. One passenger onboard a plane that had landed at JFK said the aircraft was being held on the tarmac due to an emergency.

politifact14880,https://www.infowars.com/pier-39-terrorist-was-an-anti-trump-antifa-supporter/,Pier 39 Terrorist Was an Anti-Trump Antifa Supporter,"Speaking to Siri Hustvedt in her Brooklyn brownstone not long before the American presidential election, conversation naturally turns to Hillary Clinton. â€œFor someone so accomplished . .. who performs as superbly as Hillary Clinton does, to be constantly criticised,â€ Hustvedt muses. â€œWhen she performs brilliantly in a debate, they call her  . I have never heard anything like that said about a man. â€ Hustvedt knows something about being an accomplished woman, and having things said about her work that would never be said about a manâ€™s. I am here to talk about her new book of essays, A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women. One of them, â€œNo Competitionâ€ catalogues her experiences as â€œa woman writer married to a man writer (Paul Auster)â€. A journalist insists that Auster must have taught her psychoanalysis and neuroscience. A publisher magnanimously instructs her to â€œkeep writingâ€ when she has already published three novels. A fan asks if her husband has written sections of her most recent novel, The Blazing World. During my meeting with Hustvedt, Auster is just a low murmur moving around elsewhere in the house. â€œHe is doing an interview upstairs,â€ Hustvedt explains. â€œI think for the first time in our history of 35 years together, we have books coming out one month apart. â€ We donâ€™t mention him again. Hustvedt says she often encounters surprise that she is, above all, a person interested in ideas. â€œWomen who write books about ideas are not instantly anointed in the way that men are. You get a lot of criticism for being too intellectual, too cerebral. But I donâ€™t see those same complaints addressed to male writers. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re out there, but not to the same degree. â€ A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women seems likely to inspire more people to call Hustvedt â€œcerebralâ€ though in this context as a compliment. Somewhat unusually in a publishing age characterised by slim essay collections about personal experience, Hustvedtâ€™s book is nearly 600 pages of learned commentary on everything from the nature of literature to neuroscience. It takes in a remark Karl Ove Knausgaard once made to her  â€”   women writers, he said, were â€œno competitionâ€  â€”   as well as the work of the   philosopher Margaret Cavendish. The centrepiece is a   meditation on â€œThe Delusions of Certaintyâ€ that ranges from the science of perception to   to the history of psychiatry. Hustvedt has never been a writer of narrow or fleeting interests. â€œThese are questions I have been addressing in both my fiction and nonfiction for a very long time,â€ she says. â€œItâ€™s about a long, long accumulation of knowledge, and changing my mind, rethinking, discovering another beat I hadnâ€™t been thinking about before. Or discovering some earlier thought thatâ€™s wrong. â€ It should be said that this is also a pretty good description of Hustvedtâ€™s conversational style. She makes a statement, then revises it, and revises it again. Itâ€™s not that she is uncertain of what she thinks itâ€™s that sheâ€™s precise. Hustvedt was born in Minnesota, in 1955, to a Norwegian mother and an American father of Norwegian descent. As a child, she spent time in Norway, and graduated with a degree there in her teens. (For days after our interview I find myself trying to emulate her correct pronunciation of the name â€œKnausgaardâ€  â€”   something like â€œ  â€). She says she became a feminist at 14, â€œcarrying around my Sisterhood Is Powerful and Kate Millett, and trying to read Simone de Beauvoir and it was that terrible edition [of The Second Sex] translated by the zoologist [Howard M Parshley]â€. In the 1980s, Hustvedt had her poetry published and got a PhD in English literature from Columbia, writing her dissertation on Dickens. She then published several novels, each to greater acclaim than the last. But the differential treatment she received as a writer and thinker who also happened to be a woman became an abiding theme in her work, too. In The Blazing World, the main character is a female artist whose work is largely neglected in her lifetime, while her husband, an art dealer, is relatively successful. â€œIn that effete microcosm,â€ writes Hustvedt, â€œit is fair to say Felix had been a giant, dealer to the stars, and I, Gargantuaâ€™s artist wife. â€ The resurrection of female intellectuals from obscurity is a preoccupation of Hustvedtâ€™s. At one point she begins to quiz me about the mathematician Emmy Noether. â€œShe did work in symmetry in mathematics that then became adopted in physics,â€ she tells me. â€œExtremely important thinker. Praised by Einstein. Praised by, I think, Heisenberg. The stellar figures of   physics thought Noether was a genius. Does Noether set off bells in your head? No?â€ The Blazing World was generally well received, but there were â€œquite a few reviews that said, â€˜But sheâ€™s not likableâ€™. Well neither is Raskolnikov,â€ Hustvedt says. â€œThis [criticism] is so much more aimed at a womanâ€™s book than a manâ€™s book. Where did that come from? What kind of a criterion is that for a work of literature?â€ Not that she is fond of hard definitions of literature. In another essay she alludes to James Wood, particularly his book How Fiction Works, with dismay and disdain. â€œItâ€™s incomprehensible to me that anyone who has read a great many books could come to any conclusion about how books should be written. â€ She talks about telling a prize committee that in the whole history of literature there has never been one clear formula for what makes a good book. â€œGoya said â€˜There are no rules in painting.â€™ And I think there are no rules. â€ Certainly Hustvedt has not been observing any rules herself. As well as writing she has a burgeoning career as a thinker in psychiatry and neuroscience. Her longstanding interest in those subjects took off after the success of The Shaking Woman, a hybrid memoir and intellectual investigation she published in 2009. The departure point was her own illness  â€”   a nervous disorder that caused her body to convulse and gave her migraines  â€”   but it quickly expanded into an inquiry into the nature of the self that encompassed both contemporary research and the work of   Charcot, a   neurologist who studied hysteria. This sideline in science has been transformative. â€œYou can sit and argue about whether or not you like a writer deep into the night, and you can make arguments about why, and at the same time itâ€™s not like finding the fault line in somebodyâ€™s argument about the predictive brain. â€ The problem is that science tends to appeal to a limited audience. â€œPeople who are working in neuroscience, they can see whatâ€™s original. People outside of those worlds, they donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m original. Where Iâ€™m shocking people. They canâ€™t see. â€ For Hustvedt the gulf between science and the humanities is something of a tragedy. In the introduction to A Woman Looking at Men   â€¦     she laments that â€œI have witnessed scenes of mutual incomprehension or, worse,    hostility. â€ She devoted her work in the sciences to drawing connections between what you could call humanistic ideas and scientific findings. She thinks that gender bias could be explained by way of the science of perception. â€œThe brain as an organ of prediction is founded on prior expectations,â€ she explains. And our prior expectations are often set up to disadvantage women: we donâ€™t associate them with artistic greatness. The connections between body and mind fascinate her, too. For example, lately Hustvedt has become â€œvery interested in the placentaâ€. It has only been lightly studied, even though scientists refer to it as a kind of â€œthird brainâ€ in the process of human development, but Hustvedtâ€™s interest is also philosophical. â€œWhat does that literal mediator, that is the beginning of every human being, have to do with our later development? The idea of mediation is there in utero as an actual physical organ. This has to have an effect on what we become. â€ Some of this abstracted talk may sound alienating, but in person Hustvedtâ€™s engagement has an infectious quality. It reminds me of something she wrote about another apparently intimidating writer, Susan Sontag. â€œIn every conversation I had with her I found myself amazed at the certitude of her opinions,â€ Hustvedt writes. In conversations with Hustvedt, the observation is slightly different: itâ€™s hard not to be amazed at the richness, the texture of her views. â€œIâ€™m always doing this tug of war between different positions. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t have a position. But I really do not have a final position on a great many profound questions,â€ she says, later adding, â€œI am alarmed by all kinds of solidified knowledge. â€ In the weeks after our interview, one particular piece of knowledge did firm up: Hillary Clinton would not be the president of the United States Donald Trump would be. Hustvedt had repeatedly told me that the election was â€œcharged with misogynyâ€. So how does she feel about things now? â€œHe was elected because his exploitation of the big lie technique worked, because misogyny is alive and well among women and men,â€ she says. â€œHe was elected because, as a study at Yale demonstrated, when faced with an identical description of an ambitious politician, both men and women respond to a female candidate with feelings of â€˜moral outrageâ€™ but have no such feelings for a power seeking male candidate. â€ It goes back to what she has been saying about the science of perception, the kinds of expectations we have for men versus those for women. â€œIf sheâ€™s emotional, then sheâ€™s like a woman. If sheâ€™s not emotional, then sheâ€™s cold and heartless,â€ she says of Clinton. â€œWhereas Trump actually has played the female role: the out of control, angry hysteric. And yet, he has been perceived as a robust, masculine figure by a large portion of the US public. The possibilities for a woman are infinitely more narrow. â€",701,440,"944533580860051456	944533584798461953	944533862121656320	944533864982175745	944534070683320321	944534850861699072	944535575775682560	944536378347524097	944536412493373442	944536850416447488	944536867676049409	944536928984150016	944538342993121280	944538375767379969	944538459460505600	944539569139142659	944539603611947008	944544175709720576	944544465250914304	944546014832332800	944547986390077442	944548220763561984	944548237414891520	944550799547527170	944551633714929665	944552503512895488	944553060084301825	944554642536648704	944555949385170944	944556093077893120	944556769614946304	944557131906220033	944559034962767872	944560701057708034	944561489087815681	944561497979568129	944562765154439170	944563745841434624	944566125693669376	944566987140861952	944568684063936512	944569931701551104	944576793222279169	944577314276470784	944577900447174656	944578180462944256	944578638757945345	944578749822939137	944579105823092736	944579712495398912	944583332129656832	944585405910978560	944585639730835456	944585730831147008	944585962868404226	944591866103820288	944593577488912385	944596599791026178	944598133073330176	944600042731638784	944600735085363200	944600834641408000	944600997829132289	944601552173625344	944603040396476416	944604056227545089	944604522575474695	944608516748087297	944610920675803136	944611724396777474	944612500758237185	944612500380766208	944612532634996737	944614665719513088	944615436989157377	944615937004617728	944616775588700160	944618248431009799	944618801399844864	944621181298184192	944621400148525057	944621819444781056	944622231107391489	944622944046608384	944625839064444928	944628444662501377	944630986318299136	944637743870763008	944637792079843329	944639969384992773	944641236295495680	944642507417141249	944658303250059265	944667175918489600	944669104505487360	944674999859736576	944677132713721857	944678212348600321	944681319006584833	944686767571132416	944687830000955393	944695094271193088	944699848837668864	944699938990116865	944700525328474112	944701881590231040	944702315273097217	944706080466198529	944714326715314176	944723600866758657	944724665418813441	944730973710647296	944750158289387520	944750550163361792	944764194452250626	944767004694712320	944767926799880192	944768068726685696	944769450628276224	944777035309899777	944820495513464832	944823016503914497	944825629412876288	944836573601894400	944850704228896769	944868958900928514	944873582135599104	944887444981268480	944889514023104512	944892979319377920	944902956859699200	944942273887813632	944945517506768896	944946073969274881	944948942244106240	944951042852163584	944983517556908032	944984550723252231	944988924937691136	944991053957836801	945003228294451201	945004615485018113	945020944569061377	945091768571383808	945091808819924992	945091851878617089	945091871579176961	945091892403998721	945098787109957632	945105402542379009	945108035856453632	945152518778077185	945207481499770880	945280047161774087	945376199857098752	945508338405605376	945714168514179072	945727361118388224	945873849425444864	945913426081173504	946020172648931328	946204076748017664	953359211794137088	970062545036996608	977637716899827713",fake

The officer was making a traffic stop Friday afternoon in the village of Hatch, about 40 miles   of Las Cruces, when a passenger got out of the vehicle and started firing, Dona Ana County sheriffâ€™s spokeswoman Kelly Jameson said in a news release.  The suspects drove south on Interstate 25 at speeds up to 100mph, then stopped at a rest stop near Radium Springs, where one of them carjacked a parked Chevrolet Cruze. Jameson said that carâ€™s owner also was shot.  Sheriffâ€™s deputies spotted the Cruze, pursued it and were able to slow it down with â€œstop sticksâ€ the suspect crashed the vehicle into a pile of wood and briefly barricaded himself in the car before surrendering to sheriffâ€™s deputies, Jameson said. The suspect had a gunshot wound to the right thigh, she said.  Meanwhile, deputies tracked down the other two suspects in Rincon after being alerted by a passerby of two men â€œacting suspiciousâ€ in the area, the sheriffâ€™s spokeswoman said.      Hatch officer Jose Chavez, who had been shot in the neck, died at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, authorities say. Chavez had been with the Hatch police for two years.  The motorist, who was not identified, shot in the carjacking also was taken to the hospital his condition wasnâ€™t immediately available.  Authorities didnâ€™t identify the three suspects or the injured motorist.  The Chillicothe Gazette in Ohio reported Saturday that James D Nelson II and Jesse D Hanes have been taken into custody in New Mexico on warrants in the 25 July shooting death of an Ohio man, and are believed to be involved in the New Mexico officerâ€™s killing.

Carney worked with the actor on his hit 2013 romantic comedy, Begin Again, and had described her in the interview as a â€œsupermodelâ€ adding that she hadnâ€™t got the essence of her character, a   and was constantly surrounded by an entourage.  On Twitter, Carney posted a screenshot of a typed statement saying: â€œIâ€™m ashamed of myself that I could say such things and Iâ€™ve been trying to account for what they say about me. In trying to pick holes in my work, I ended up blaming someone else. â€ â€œKeira was nothing but professional and dedicated during that film and she contributed hugely to its success,â€ he added, before concluding that what he said about the actor is â€œnot something I could ever justify, and will never repeatâ€. In the interview  â€”   done to promote the release of his latest film, Sing Street  â€”   Carney had said that Begin Again had taught him â€œnever [to] make a film with supermodels again. â€ â€œKeiraâ€™s thing is to hide who you are, and I donâ€™t think you can be an actor and do that,â€ he had said of his experience working with her. â€œI donâ€™t want to rubbish Keira, but you know itâ€™s hard being a film actor, and it requires a certain level of honesty and   that I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s ready for yet and I certainly donâ€™t think she was ready for on that film. â€ Following the comments, many directors who had worked with Knightley rallied to her defence.  Mark Romanek, who directed the actor in Never Let Me Go, wrote on Twitter that working with Knightley was â€œutterly spectacularâ€. Meanwhile Lorene Scafaria, Knightleyâ€™s director for Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, said she was â€œjust lovelyâ€ and Say When director Lynn Shelton also referred to the actor as â€œmagnificentâ€.",719,570,"897519537234595840	897527392205500417	897527664080068612	897531326525562884	897533332996595712	897533465318400001	897539686910103553	897556183787204610	897561203408547844	897569330031972352	897578672584044544	897605651437891584	897607877342486530	897613689733435393	897633087936495620	897657763240824833	897690170216116225	897693023584358401	897694550508130307	897701583445798913	897726019804778496	897758786408128513	897790736615194625	897791576428228609	897798909367656448	897813047875698688	897831130367492098	897842609854574592	897848209871065088	897851290155397121	897858733727985664	897874776571695104	897887802741936135	897908614572134400	897909950936215552	897909972557852672	897913440806809600	897916418649411584	897920922459549700	897921409237700608	897926213305417729	897927617374019584	897933286609084416	897938625194864641	897941082079506432	897948522527563776	897951016020213761	897952113463926788	897956473262620672	897965066485739520	897973803938197504	897977372569292801	897993675707437056	898002572560039936	898021852932472832	898023362970169346	898023369328566273	898057500229894144	898063353104420864	898149873232617472	898150714769379328	898151456649482240	898156412601114624	898161817129824256	898165061948248064	898182089295634432	898183941341011970	898184047456858112	898184123986173953	898184165279092738	898193325861335040	898197552272637952	898199494122061824	898201580855545857	898202433683283968	898206705619582976	898212831434338304	898226354969235456	898227031363776512	898229087327719424	898238350125150208	898245606208147456	898246062691016705	898252928569323520	898254219815395328	898254995048472576	898260292752166912	898264604190449664	898265714888392704	898266066782179332	898268686573752320	898278471201411072	898287245748314112	898287398911594496	898336595572473857	898375610522890240	898416018501939202	898559655734984704	898611970705772545	898612039249256450	898612077316714498	898621862808301570	898622429144260608	898623806603907076	898683757510754304	898786438078058496	898872963461599232	898892155141226497	898904207524102144	898920134387146752	898920365535186947	898920470128545793	899055189977473026	899166564825608192	899167031391645701	899279899076243457	899312725825912832	899690862011072512	899715194120753152	900753303667175424	900894260341469185	900904416269787136	1026182128730402816	1051710848064937984",fake
politifact14475,http://wrpm33.com/celebrity/what-adam-sandler-is-saying-about-mormons-6/, What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons,"There is a moment in new US comedy Bad Moms where Mila Kunisâ€™s Amy finally decides sheâ€™s had enough. After a day spent running from school to work, from vetâ€™s appointments to childrenâ€™s hobbies, she reaches the end of her tether at a PTA meeting from hell in which she is asked to join â€œthe bakery policeâ€. â€œNo, thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m done,â€ she says, heading to a bar instead. â€œIf that makes me a bad mom then thatâ€™s fine. â€ Itâ€™s a scene many of us can relate to. Amy, with her desire to cut free in a fast car, down the odd drink and stop making her childrenâ€™s breakfast every morning, is not alone. In addition to Bad Moms, which pulled in $23m at the US box office last weekend, holding its own against spy juggernaut Jason Bourne, thereâ€™s Netflixâ€™s latest movie, Tallulah, in which Ellen Pageâ€™s free spirit steals a toddler from a hotel room when the childâ€™s mother passes out in a drunken coma after a bad date. On television, the hit US comedy Mom, now in its fourth season, follows Allison Janneyâ€™s character as she attempts to make amends after years of bad motherhood, while the cult hit Odd Mom Out turns a gimlet eye on the terrible and terrifying mothers of Manhattanâ€™s Upper East Side as they try to put the fun into fundraisers. Crime fiction, meanwhile, is saturated with imperfect mothers, from the heroine of Gilly Macmillanâ€™s debut Burnt Paper Sky, who loses her son on a walk in the park, to Alex Marwoodâ€™s The Darkest Secret, in which none of the mothers featured, good, bad, or apparently indifferent, is quite as she initially seems. The Mare, the hugely anticipated third novel from Mary Gaitskill, her first in more than a decade, also takes motherhood as its starting point. Drawing inspiration from Enid Bagnoldâ€™s National Velvet, Gaitskill tells the story of privileged white woman Ginger, Velvet  â€”   the Dominican teenager she supports for a time â€”   and Silvia, the girlâ€™s furious mother. It is both an emotional    tale and a raw meditation on motherhood. â€œBack in the 1990s I used to feel criticised by women for not having children, like there must be something wrong with me,â€ Gaitskill told New York Magazine on the bookâ€™s US publication. â€œPeople would say â€˜I donâ€™t see how a woman could be happy without childrenâ€™. It was almost like a dogma. [Now thatâ€™s changed] people got a good look and realised that it is really hard and itâ€™s not always lovable and rosy and everything working out. Maybe reality set in. â€ Is it this new understanding of the grimy reality lurking behind the   vision thatâ€™s driving us to embrace mums behaving badly? â€œI think partially what has happened is that the generation gap has narrowed,â€ says Jill Kargman, creator of Odd Mom Out. â€œWe donâ€™t age the way we used to, and pop culture reflects that  â€”   it tackles the fact that weâ€™re faking it being adults and often donâ€™t know what the hell weâ€™re doing. Itâ€™s also the case that, 20 years ago, women were absent from leadership positions within the industry now we have a voice. â€ Novelist Ayelet Waldman, who tackled this subject in 2009 with a series of essays titled Bad Mother, agrees that there has been a shift towards   projects within the entertainment industry, but sounds a note of caution. â€œThereâ€™s definitely been a resurgence of interest in movies by or about women, which started when Bridesmaids knocked it out of the financial park, but if you look at Bad Moms, youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s written and directed by men [Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who made their names with Las   lad fest The Hangover] and I think thatâ€™s telling. Female writers would probably present a less hackneyed, more complete version of what it means to be a mother. â€ Certainly itâ€™s true that Tallulah, which is written and directed by a woman, Sian Heder, who also writes for   prison drama Orange Is The New Black, presents a far more complicated picture of bad motherhood than the enjoyable but shallow Bad Moms, which for all the involvement of female producer Suzanne Todd is essentially a   The Hangover for women complete with   walking scenes and funky soundtrack. By contrast, Tallulahâ€™s bad mother, the neurotic, narcissistic Carolyn, is initially presented as a caricature of bad motherhood. Caked in makeup and squeezed into a hot pink dress, she barely registers her baby girl, doesnâ€™t appear to know how to change a nappy and has whatâ€™s best described as a cavalier approach to childcare, at one point dismissing her daughterâ€™s progress towards an open window with the words â€œshe has to learnâ€. Yet as the film progresses, our opinion of Carolyn changes and, if not entirely supporting her actions, we at least come to understand the   from which they spring. â€œAfter the premiere I became this weird priest hearing these   confessions and I realised all mums feel like failures,â€ Heder told the Los Angeles Times. â€œThereâ€™s a disconnect between the role of the mother as itâ€™s presented in the movies and what it actually feels like to be a mum, the amount of guilt and shame you put on yourself. â€ Itâ€™s this disconnect that films such as Bad Moms and shows such as Odd Mom Out tap into. The best scenes in Bad Moms are those in which our heroines,   Amy (Kunis) raunchy Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and mousey Kiki (Kristen Bell) cut loose, laughing hysterically as they leave the stresses of modern motherhood behind, while Odd Mom Out works so well because Kargman relishes lifeâ€™s absurdities. â€œIf you didnâ€™t see the humour in these sort of situations youâ€™d go crazy,â€ she says. â€œThereâ€™s so much insecurity surrounding motherhood. The way that people feel better about themselves is basically by putting others down. â€ Gill Hornby, whose 2013 novel The Hive treads similar ground to Bad Moms, agrees. â€œI think most people think theyâ€™re perfect mothers and itâ€™s everyone else whoâ€™s the problem,â€ she says. â€œA lot of time when people say â€˜oh, Iâ€™m a terrible motherâ€™ they actually donâ€™t mean it all in fact they want people to tell them thatâ€™s not true. Similarly you would never hear men saying â€˜oh, sheâ€™s a crap motherâ€™  â€”   itâ€™s always driven by other women, which sounds unsisterly but is true. â€ Yet Hornby admits she has some sympathy with those who buy into the motherhood myth. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of acting and spinning involved, and itâ€™s easy to act out of character  â€”   one of the things that always interested me is the idea of being thrust into an unelected friendship group, people you didnâ€™t choose to be friends with, and the effects that can have on your personality. Itâ€™s easy to get sucked in. â€ Itâ€™s also true that most of these mothers arenâ€™t exactly bad. Theyâ€™re not the wicked witches of fairytales, the cackling stepmothers looming with poisonous apples, the women forcing children out of their family homes into the dark woods nor are they the monsters of film past. There are no   wielding Mommie Dearests or violent abusers like Preciousâ€™s Mary. Itâ€™s notable that much of this â€œbad motheringâ€ would be fine if it was done by fathers. â€œDads have a      card,â€ says Kargman. â€œTraditionally their role was always to be the breadwinner so no one expected them to pitch in domestically. Iâ€™m sure back when cavemen went to hunt and the cave kids were with their mum there were still societal expectations placed on her. Itâ€™s almost like people know there are deadbeat dads, absentee dads, abusive dads, drunk dads, so if theyâ€™re anything remotely nice or normal they get a parade, whereas if we are human for one second we are branded. â€ Waldman agrees. â€œThe bar is set so low for fathers,â€ she says. â€œMy husband was once in the grocery store holding our baby who was filthy, covered in snot and chewing on a twist tie  â€”   basically something that has a sharp wire in it  â€”   and a lady stopped him and said, â€˜You are such a good dadâ€™. Imagine if Iâ€™d been standing there holding a filthy kid who was chewing on a bit of garbage: Iâ€™d have been arrested. The double standards are maddening. â€ Despite these concerns, Waldman says sheâ€™s in favour of the bad mummy trend. â€œUltimately I think itâ€™s a good thing  â€”   the more images we have of mothers that donâ€™t fit into that traditional selfless image the better,â€ she says. â€œSome of these films may be hitting the   fruit of tired female stories  â€”   like    mums versus mothers who work  â€”   but eventually weâ€™ll see more films written for women by women that are original, interesting and truly subversive. Theyâ€™ll be worth going to see. â€ Bad Moms is released in the UK on 26 August Tallulah is available on Netflix All Together Now by Gill Hornby is out in paperback, Abacus, Â£5. 99 The Mare is published by Serpentâ€™s Tail, Â£12. 99, Katharine Hepburn as Violet VenableSuddenly, Last Summer (1959) Hepburn is on magisterial, monstrous form in Joseph Mankiewiczâ€™s gloriously overheated take on Tennessee Williams.

The hospitality sector is also seeing cancellations, hotels are tightening security and foreign embassies are looking at reducing staffing after the attack on Friday claimed the lives of nine Italians, seven Japanese, an American, an Indian and some Bangladeshi nationals.  Fast Retailing, the Japanese owner of the Uniqlo   brand, said it would suspend all but critical travel to Bangladesh and has told staff to stay indoors.  Bangladeshâ€™s $26bn garment industry has been bracing itself for the fallout of Fridayâ€™s killings, fearing major retailers could rethink their sourcing plans after the latest attack targeting foreigners.  Bangladesh, one of the worldâ€™s poorest countries, relies on garments for about 80% of its exports and for about 4 million jobs,. It ranks behind only China as a supplier of clothes to developed markets such as Europe and the United States. Uniqlo has 10 Japanese staff in Bangladesh, one of its major production hubs outside China, and was among the first to confirm it would tighten travel restrictions already in place after attacks last year. Shovon Islam, the head of Sparrow Group, which supplies brands including Marks  Spencer and Gap, said: â€œObviously this is generating a lot of concern with all the brands my company works with. â€ He said that after a foreigner was killed in Bangladesh last year, some overseas companies pared back travel to the country and asked for meetings to be held in Bangkok, New Delhi or Hong Kong instead.  Islam said: â€œThis time the intensity of the threat is much higher and we will definitely see companies altering their plans. â€  Sudhir Dhingra, the head of Orient Craft based in the Indian city of Gurgaon, said: â€œThereâ€™ll definitely be an impact on the garment industry. I was just speaking to a top label which said its official who was supposed to visit Bangladesh to inspect an order has refused to go. â€  Bangladesh garment exporters who dealt with some of those killed in the attack were still coming to terms with what has happened. â€œI was doing business with six of the nine Italians who died. Itâ€™s shocking and heartbreaking,â€ said Meshba Uddin Ali, the managing director of Wega Fashion Sweater.  Amos Ho, a senior manager at Pou Chen, one of the worldâ€™s largest makers of trainers for brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma, said: â€œWeâ€™ve urged our employees to be cautious. They have to pay attention to their personal safety. â€  Industry analysts have suggested clothing brands may now consider shifting out of Bangladesh to less unsettled countries in Asia, such as Cambodia and Sri Lanka. No major companies have yet signalled official plans.  â€œThere are no plans on changing any sourcing, but we are following developments closely,â€ Swedenâ€™s HM said in a statement echoed by other big retailers.  TheUS and British embassies in Bangladesh may reduce staff numbers, one diplomatic source said, and ask only essential staff to stay on.  The Japanese construction companies Obayashi and Shimizu, which both have more than a dozen employees working on bridge projects in Bangladesh, said they had advised staff to stay indoors.  At least two   hotels in Dhaka that cater primarily to business clients said they had received cancellations since Fridayâ€™s attack. â€œWhenever people book itâ€™s usually within two or three days of their visit to Dhaka and now nobody is doing any bookings at all,â€ said a source at one of the hotels, adding that this week was typically quiet due to the upcoming Eid celebrations.

The toilet, which the Guardian can confirm is fully functioning, is the work of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, who describes the piece as â€œ100% art for the 99%â€. Visitors to the museum are able to use the golden toilet in much the same way as they would use a normal toilet. It is located in a standard,   bathroom on the fourth floor of the museum, a small placard the only indication of its presence. The Guardian was invited to use the facilities on Friday morning. Entering the bathroom, the eye was immediately drawn to the toilet. The bright bowl glimmered under the bathroomâ€™s harsh fluorescent light, while the   gold seat looked sparkly and inviting. The surface proved forgiving on the rear of the thigh and once the procedure was complete, the flush worked like a charm. The golden toilet was able to handle solids. The toilet was created to the exact dimensions of the Guggenheimâ€™s existing toilets. The museum shipped two toilets to Italy, where Cattelan cast the golden toilet in several parts before welding it together. Michael Zall, associate director of operations at the Guggenheim, oversaw the installation of the toilet. He engaged the services of a â€œvery professionalâ€ plumber, who he said was excited by the prospect of fitting a solid gold toilet. â€œWhen he was here he kind of turned into a little kid, and he said he actually had butterflies,â€ Zall said. The toilet was fitted on Monday. â€œWe wanted to try to get it here and get it in as quick as possible so that we had some time to troubleshoot and make sure everything is just right,â€ Zall said. He said the troubleshooting had involved â€œa lot of flushingâ€.  â€œPutting some paper in it, making sure it flushed well, that everything left the toilet. â€ In a press release the Guggenheim linked the golden toilet to Donald Trumpâ€™s business and political career. â€œThe aesthetics of this â€˜throneâ€™ recall nothing so much as the gilded excess of Trumpâ€™s   ventures and private residences,â€ it said. While Trump is known to have golden chairs in his New York City penthouse, it is not known whether he has a golden toilet. Cattelan told the Guggenheim that he had the idea for the toilet before Trumpâ€™s political rise, but said â€œit was probably in the airâ€. He said the golden toilet is in part a nod to Marcel Duchampâ€™s 1917 artwork Fountain, which was a urinal. Nathan Otterson, senior conservator, objects at the Guggenheim, is responsible for maintaining the toilet. He said a cleaning crew will attend to the toilet every 15 minutes. â€œTheyâ€™ll wipe down the toilet with a medical wipe that will sanitize it and then at a longer interval it will be   like in a hospital,â€ he said. A security officer will stand guard outside the toilet. People will only be allowed to enter one at a time, and bags must be left outside. â€œWe would hope no one would try to remove part of the toilet,â€ Otterson said. There has been some internal discussion over imposing a time limit on golden toilet visits, he said, with people potentially being limited to five minutes per visit. There was a small line of people outside the Guggenheim on Friday morning. A woman called Rachel, who asked that her last name not be used, said she was there specifically to use the golden toilet. She declined to elaborate on her plans, but said she was â€œexcitedâ€ at the prospect of using the toilet. â€œA friend posted it on Facebook last night,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s hilarious and who wouldnâ€™t want to pee on art?â€ Rachel said her most enjoyable toilet experience to date was in Japan. â€œThey have the best toilets. They have water in them, theyâ€™re heated, sometimes they play music. Theyâ€™re amazing. â€",300,470,,fake

This seems to be a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasnâ€™t classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk. â€  â€”   Jason Miller, Trump senior communications adviser, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill nudges back at the report of a hack of Clinton campaign data with a statement that raises lots of question marks:  An analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack. Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised.  The computer network used by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign has been hacked, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.  The new intrusion is part of a broad   on Democratic political organizations, the sources said, though it was not immediately clear that Russian hackers were behind the third attack.  In a statement, the FBI said it was looking into the matter. The bureau said it â€œtakes seriously any allegations of intrusionsâ€ and is â€œaware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these mattersâ€. Russian hackers designated Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear by cybersecurity analysts broke into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) beginning last year and are believed to be the source of   organization WikiLeaksâ€™s release of 20, 000 emails, though the group has denied this. Last Sunday, that leak led to the resignation of the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, shortly before the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia. The breach of the DNC is believed by security researchers in private industry and the US government to have been the work Russian intelligence services. This week the fundraising network of the the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) was breached, an act Reuters said US intelligence officials had attributed to Russians as well. The US Department of Justiceâ€™s national security division is investigating whether hacking attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened US security, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. With 20 extremely good reasons (read: electoral votes) to discover a local connection in Pennsylvania, Virginia senator Tim Kaine saw reflections of his childhood walking through the Kâ€™NEX toy manufacturer in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, writes Lauren Gambino at the scene: The Vice Presidential nominee told the crowd of about 300 people, made up of Kâ€™NEX employees and teachers, that he recognized some of the machinery from his childhood, working alongside his family in his fatherâ€™s iron crafting business in Kansas. â€œThis brings back memories, coming here and seeing some machinery thatâ€™s really familiar to me and some machinery thatâ€™s not so familiar,â€ Kaine said, standing in front of the campaign logo made of Kâ€™NEX.  â€œ[It was] his five or six employees, my two brothers, me and my mom basically making that business work, thatâ€™s what small business do,â€ Kaine said.  These anecdotes, delivered with Kaineâ€™s affable smile, add up to strong justification for the Virginia senatorâ€™s place on the ticket.  â€œYou will hear people say when it comes to manufacturing that American manufacturing is dead,â€ said Kaine, â€œbut that is not the case and itâ€™s often these family businesses just like Rodon Kâ€™NEX that are keeping it alive. â€ Kaine introduced Clinton, who was joined by her husband and Kaineâ€™s wife, Anne Holton. The four traveled by bus from Philadelphia, where they kicked off a   tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio.  Who wishes it were Friday? Good news for you: tis.  Trump finishes off with an insult for the fire marshall who has not allowed extra people into the hall   â€œheâ€™s probably a Democrat. .. he doesnâ€™t get itâ€   before heading to the room next door where apparently 1000 spillover people are waiting. Trump seems to be doing a recap on the most offensive things heâ€™s said to journalists during the campaign. Heâ€™s mentionied New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who suffers from a physical disability, which Trump appeared to imitate when talking about him several months ago.  â€œI didnâ€™t know he was disabled. I didnâ€™t know it. I didnâ€™t know it all. I had no idea,â€ said Trump in Colorado Springs. Trump also just referenced his comments said about Fox Newsâ€™ Megyn Kelly, where he had said after a debate   after she asked him tough questions   that she had â€œblood coming out of her wherever. â€  â€œI was talking about her nose. Maybe her ears,â€ just said Trump in Colorado Springs. It was widely assumed that Trump was referring to Kelly getting her period when he made his reference to â€œwhatever. â€  â€œI wanted to get back onto the questions of taxes and economies, I said â€˜whateverâ€™ . .. these are sick people. But really, it was nose,â€ he said. Donald Trump said he is â€œstarting to agreeâ€ with his supporters who chanted â€œlock her upâ€ regarding Hillary Clinton during his events. â€œHow do you lie to the FBI and now youâ€™re running for presidentâ€ asked Trump in Colorado Springs, speaking about Clinton. He repeated the line several times to emphasize it. The crowd began chanting â€œlock her up, lock her up. â€ â€œYou know what, Iâ€™ve been saying lets just beat her on November 8, but you know what, Iâ€™m starting to agree with you,â€ said Trump. â€œEvery time I mention her, people start screaming lock her up. But after watching that performance, with so many lies. .. Iâ€™m taking the gloves off,â€ he said. â€œJust remember this, Trump is going to be no more Mister Nice Guy. Tell Hillary Iâ€™m not going to be nice anymore, are you ready?â€ he said. This weekend the Koch Brothers are hosting a retreat for top conservative donors in Colorado Springs. And Trump just happens to be in Colorado Springs today. But, Charles Koch rebuffed Trumpâ€™s attempts to meet with him, according to Politico.  The Koch brothers, who are usually huge GOP supporters, have spoken out against Trump as nominee and have said they donâ€™t plan to help fund him. â€œI think I have the best temperament, or certainly one of the best, of anyone thatâ€™s ever run for the office of president,â€ declares Trump. â€œMy temperament is winner. I know how to win. My whole life Iâ€™ve been winning,â€ he said. Trump criticized CNN, complaining how they had reported on his tweets lately. He then claimed that he could see the red light on the camera manâ€™s camera turn off. Trump talks about the Nielsen ratings for television that have just come out, which shows 32 million people tuned into watch Trumpâ€™s speech, while 28 million saw Clintonâ€™s last night. He says the RNC last week in Cleveland was much better than the DNC, and, being a TV guy, notes he thought the RNC background set was better.  â€œWe beat her by millions on televisions,â€ said Trump. â€œHonestly, the numbers were incredible. Which tells you, isnâ€™t it good to have Trump running for the presidency?â€ Trump starts off getting the crowd to boo the fire marshall, as apparently hundreds of people waiting outside are not being allowed into the venue because the fire marshall wonâ€™t let them. â€œIt really is so unfair,â€ said Trump. â€œThe reasons they wont let them in is because they donâ€™t know what the hell theyâ€™re doing. Too bad. â€œMaybe theyâ€™re a Hillary person? Probably,â€ he said. Announcement at the Trump event in Colorado Springs   where Trump was supposed to take to the stage 45 minutes ago   that the Republican nominee is now in the building and is expected to address the crowd in five minutes. Interesting contrast between Donald Trump and his running mate when it comes to dealing with the media. During rallies, Trump regularly gets supporters to turn to the media and boo and has banned a list of publications from covering his events. His VP pick Mike Pence said earlier today that he was trying to stop reporters being denied entry. â€œI have a long history. ..of advocating and defending for a free and independent press,â€ he said. And now Pence is taking it one step further, supplying reporters on the campaign trail with birthday cake!",913,899,9.06E+17,fake

The simple answer is that they are fans of â€œcuppingâ€  â€”   an alternative health technique that involves pressing hot jars on to the body. This creates suction, which is claimed to increase blood flow to those areas. The swimmers and gymnasts who use it say it helps relieve soreness in their battered bodies. It would certainly help relieve overburdened wallets, but there is no evidence it does anything else. Eating jam out of those jars would probably have a more significant physical impact, though it might not be the most nutritionally savvy strategy. But then again, this is the Olympics. Aside from proving that Olympians are just as credulous as celebrity cupping fans like Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow when it comes to   thereâ€™s something more interesting at work here. Years and years of relentless, gruelling, exhausting training have brought these bodies to this moment. Now they are at the very culmination of that process. There is no more training they can fit in, nothing left to do but get out there and perform, while the eyes of the world watch them. Suddenly, itâ€™s not the body that matters but the mind. The pressure is immense  â€”   and unimaginable to most of us. In that pressure cooker, if you get your head in the right place by some hokey but essentially harmless alternative therapy that your teammate swears works for them, it must be really hard to see the down side. Why wouldnâ€™t you give it a try? Even though itâ€™s totally unproven as an effective therapy, cupping involves lying down, being forced to relax, while someone does something painless to you that they authoritatively claim will make you feel better. They might as well just rename it the Placebo Treatment  â€”   but thatâ€™s exactly what the circumstances call for. A tiny moment of releasing the pressure of all that expectation and tension. The byword in sport these days is â€œmarginal gainsâ€  â€”   tiny, incremental adjustments in kit, technique and training that, when added together, make for big improvements. Think of cupping as the   version. After all, most athletes have their own rituals and superstitions  â€”   and if a lifetime of dreaming of gold came down to a few minutes of your life, you would take every edge you can get too, and feel all the better for it.",777,422,"808032026980978688	808036291979935744	808039019703631872	812853893512232960	813950100082982912	814893832613396480	815059661120569345	819634656089952256	893964465540149249",fake

The latest ABC print sale audit shows national papers down only 2. 8% year on year and a mere 0. 79% on Brexit June. All three quality Sundays  â€”   the Observer, Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Times  â€”   sold more copies last month than in July 2015. And a look at ABCâ€™s   report (print and online) on 174 of Britainâ€™s biggest magazines seems to tell a familiar story. Thereâ€™s an average drop of 5. 2% year on year to be sure  â€”   more grist for the  â€™ mill  â€”   yet look a little deeper. Youâ€™ll find a lot of winners among the losers: try House Beautiful, Harperâ€™s Bazaar and Esquire. But thereâ€™s also a cluster of solid performers gaining a little and losing nothing. Hereâ€™s the Economist in the UK, up 3. 7% the incredibly resilient Private Eye, up 0. 8% The Week, up 0. 7% Prospect, up 3. 3% the Oldie, up 0. 6% the Times Literary Supplement, up 7. 8%. And  â€”   bouncing on dramatic internet expansion  â€”   thereâ€™s the Spectator, up 37. 9%. In short, opinion, reportage, analysis and wit still find a market. Words, not pictures. Ideas, not celebrity mush. Life, not lists. Just thought Iâ€™d mention it. Last month, Gawker Media was American publishingâ€™s   website, with 434m page views overall. This week, the Gawker gossip site (Private Eye with a tabloid twist) that began it all will be dead and buried  â€”   closed by the cumulative weight of   lawsuits funded by a vigilante Silicon Valley billionaire with his own agenda.

So if you are in the fashion gang and the goal is to capture your Look rather than what lies beneath, the armâ€™s length selfie is way cooler. Find somewhere photogenic to perch, then sit with one foot drawn towards your crotch (this is not comfortable but â€œreadsâ€ as relaxed, which is what matters) and hold the phone as far from you as you can, angled downward so that your body is in the photo but not your head.

Michael Sandford, 20, will be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty to lesser charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business.  The Briton attempted to grab a pistol from a police officer at a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas four months before the election, and said he had wanted to kill the then presidential candidate. Sandford had hoped to receive the minimum sentence of   months in prison, because he has no previous convictions, and to be allowed to serve it in England. But his mother has said he is terrified that pressure from the   may result in a more severe sentence that has to be served in the US. Lynne Sandford said: â€œWhen he first heard that Mr Trump had won, he told me: â€˜Iâ€™m so glad I didnâ€™t do what I wanted to do that day, and I do accept and respect the decision of the American people.â€™ But within 24 hours, it hit him like a sledgehammer. â€œHe was in a terrible state, saying: â€˜What if the judge decides to increase my sentence to get onside with Trump? What if Trump wants to have me bumped off in prison, what if he wants to make example of me and not let me out of prison? â€™â€ Lynne Sandford has seen her son once since he was taken into custody, but will fly to the US for his sentencing on 13 December. She said Michael had recently written her a letter saying he was struggling to get by.  â€œHe said: â€˜I canâ€™t describe how Iâ€™m feeling. Tears are streaming down my face as I write this. I miss you all and love you all more than words can explain. I need to be back home with you all. Iâ€™m so alone, cold and scared here. You all mean everything to me and Iâ€™m so sorry for how I have treated you all. I love you, I love you, I love you,â€™â€ she said. Her son has a range of acute and complex medical issues. He has had severe obsessive compulsive disorder, was sectioned aged 14, previously tried to kill himself, and has a heart condition. He was diagnosed as having been under the influence of a delusional, psychotic episode at the time of the incident.  He was initially told he faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison after being charged in June with disrupting an official function and two firearms offences. He is being held in custody at a US   detention centre in Nevada. â€œThe US and UK have to agree to him serving his sentence in England. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a problem for the English side, but once Mr Trump is president, he might not agree to it,â€ Lynne Sandford said. â€œThatâ€™s what weâ€™re worried about.  â€œI have written to President Obama and Theresa May to see if they can intervene. Iâ€™m hoping that President Obama will show compassion and realise that this poor sap could be on the receiving end of Trumpâ€™s anger, and I am urging him to act in any way he can while he is still in power. â€  She said she had received a standard reply from Downing Street and was yet to hear from the White House. Her son has been on suicide watch for much of his time in detention. â€œWhen heâ€™s on suicide watch, heâ€™s in isolation his cell 24 hours a day. He is not allowed anything in with him not even toilet paper, in case he rams it down his throat,â€ she said.  She has been told her son is being given 15 tablets a day, but not what for or what dosage. â€œAll I know is he is being given them erratically, sometimes in one go. Heâ€™s had more seizures and has been hallucinating. I would imagine this is the result of the erratic medication,â€ she said. Her son had lost a great deal of weight and was less than eight stone, she said. Michael, who is 5ft 10, has had anorexia nervosa in the past. â€œHe is eating porridge in the morning and a bread roll in the evening, and thatâ€™s it. He is unable to sleep at night because the lights in his cell are kept on all night. He is severely depressed,â€ the mother said. She said she wanted to thank Guardian readers who had donated more than Â£10, 000 to a Crowdjustice page set up to raise money for his legal fees after the Guardianâ€™s Weekend magazine wrote about his case. â€œIt was an amazing response,â€ she said. â€œWe were so touched and appreciative, and Michael passes on his sincerest thanks to everybody trying to help him. Iâ€™m glad readers realise that despite what he attempted to do, heâ€™s not a bad person at heart, and that he needs help. â€ She has started a new Crowdjustice page to raise funds to try to bring

It canâ€™t help but remind us of the absence of the man who turned a profile of Federer into the greatest essay about tennis. That David Foster Wallace died by his own hand so soon after the conclusion of the 2008 US Open, the last year when Federer would win that tournament, only makes the resonance echo louder. In an effort, perhaps, to salve that wound for Wallace fans, earlier this year the Library of America released a new anthology of Wallaceâ€™s tennis writing. Even though the game has moved on from the period that Wallace covered (the most recent essay is from a decade ago) the collection is still rich with insights into how math and metaphysics make tennis the most beautiful of sports. Wallace was interested in how transcendence was possible if the whole world was mediated through the self. In both his fiction and essays, Wallace used tennis to wrestle with this unanswerable question. Here, in a passage from his   Infinite Jest, a tennis coach muses to himself:  The true opponent, the enfolding boundary, is the player himself. Always and only the self out there, on court, to be met, fought, brought to the table to hammer out terms. The competing boy on the netâ€™s other side: he is not the foe: he is more the partner in the dance.  This philosophy echoes some ideas that also surface in the tennis writing of the New Yorker writer John McPhee. Levels of the Game, McPheeâ€™s   dissection of a   match between Chuck Graebner and Arhur Ashe at the 1968 US Open, manages to be about the self, racism, the American south, Republicans, Democrats, the 1960s, the professionalization of tennis, human excellence, art and politics. This forms a fascinating contrast with Wallaceâ€™s own tennis style, as described in his writing. In his own childhood, Wallace wrote, he wasnâ€™t thinking about transcendence at all. He was â€œplaying the conditionsâ€ using environmental factors  â€”   particularly the midwestâ€™s frustratingly strong and chaotic winds  â€”   to his advantage. The wind could make a good ball go long and â€œdrove some kids   with the caprice and unfairness of it all, and on real windy days these kids, usually with talent out the bazoo, would have their first apoplectic   tantrum in about the matchâ€™s third gameâ€. Meanwhile, Wallace, who â€œwas such a lazy turd in practiceâ€ would calmly hit the ball down the middle of the court, daring the other players to take the aforementioned   risks.  Wallaceâ€™s method of playing tennis isnâ€™t unique the approach even has its own book, though not a literary one. Itâ€™s called Winning Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis, written by the superstar coach and ESPN commentator Brad Gilbert. Gilbertâ€™s philosophy is simple: tennis is about winning games and sets. Forget about transcending the self  â€”   play the opponent physically and psychologically, play the conditions, use every advantage you can muster, and donâ€™t worry about perfection. Itâ€™s not clear if Wallace ever read Gilbertâ€™s book (he never mentions it) but itâ€™s likely he did. The book was extremely popular in the 1990s. And in todayâ€™s tennis, winning ugly is probably best represented by the current world No 1, Novak Djokovic. He plays the game with a style something like the   from the Terminator movies, morphing around whatever you throw at him to become even deadlier until you go mad trying to beat him. It was Federerâ€™s much more elegant style, which could be called â€œwinning beautifulâ€ that drew Wallace to him. Wallace spent almost no time interviewing Federer for his virtuosic essay Roger Federer as Religious Experience, originally published in the New York Times Magazine. Wallaceâ€™s argument was that Federerâ€™s greatness lay in the way he turned compositional beauty into a kind of weapon, in the way he transcended the limits of the human body and the speed at which we think. This made Federer a somewhat uninteresting person, nearly   but capable of unimaginable physical grace. Itâ€™s hard not to see some element of   in all Wallaceâ€™s praise of Federer. His writing always betrayed some of his desire to win ugly. Itâ€™s hard to think of a writer whose voice more relied on the presence of the authorial self on the page. Wallace reveled in subverting magazine assignments, and liked to use every trick in the book to move, impress and thrill a reader. In a way, his writing is often like an extended match between Federer and Djokovic, with Wallace playing both parts, luring you into traps one second, moving you to tears with beauty and grace the next. The transcendent impulse in Wallaceâ€™s writing is the key to his recent canonization. At its best, this impulse lent Wallaceâ€™s writing an otherworldly quality, as if he had been sent here to explain us to ourselves. Without it, thereâ€™s no This Is Water, the commencement speech posthumously turned into a     book no long list of things learned in rehab that became one of Infinite Jestâ€™s most widely quoted passages and no     transcendent description of the key to Federerâ€™s appeal  â€”   â€œhav[ing] to do with   â€¦     human beingsâ€™ reconciliation to having a bodyâ€. Sometimes one wonders what Wallace would have made of his both understandable and frustrating elevation to Saint Dave. But in his tennis writing itâ€™s not hard, sometimes, to see why heâ€™s treated like a modern prophet. No one can write about tennis like this now, just like no one can imagine the â€œBaby Federersâ€ like Milos Raonic or Grigor Dmitrov redefining the sport with weaponized beauty the way Roger has. But perhaps thatâ€™s because weâ€™re waiting for someone to write like Wallace or play like Federer, instead of looking for players and writers who create whole new ways to win, ugly and beautiful all at once.

And then it hits the shore and bounces back, and then it comes back again, but itâ€™s much smaller and muted. But those little waves are still going back and forth. â€ Phillips, a former district governor for Rotary International and an engineer by trade, moved to Schenectady more than 30 years ago to work at General Electric (GE) once the largest single employer in the region. But in 1974, General Electric moved its headquarters from New York City to a more expansive facility in Fairfield, Connecticut and, between that and the tectonic shifts in Americaâ€™s economy, the successive waves of downsizing changed the city and the surrounding area in ways nobody could have predicted. The loss of jobs at GE  â€”   which, at its height, employed about 30, 000 workers in a vertically integrated manufacturing facility with back office functions for the rest of the corporation  â€”   transformed Schenectady (like the loss of so many other manufacturers would transform so many other manufacturing communities) into a very different and not altogether better place for the people who had located their lives here. Only about 5, 600 people worked in manufacturing in the county in 2011  â€”   total. General Electric has only about 4, 000 employees there now. The largest employment sectors are healthcare and retail work as part of an economic development plan, the state licensed a casino at the site of one of the manufacturing facilities once used by GE and the 1, 500 jobs it will bring to the area is considered a huge boon. What happened to Schenectady as a result of GE scaling back its operations in the area isnâ€™t a unique story: you could write a similar piece about any American rust belt town. But maybe to understand the very real economic anxiety that people feel here it helps to understand the sense of security with which many people grew up. Sitting in the living room of his house in Scotia  â€”   a suburb just across the river that was developed as the middle class, created by   jobs at GE, increased the demand for housing in the area  â€”   Bernie Witkowski reminisced about the role the company played in his family. â€œWhen [my dad] got a job with General Electric, that was it. I mean, that was the dream, OK?â€ he said.  â€œThe GE was the thing. Almost all my uncles worked for General Electric in Schenectady, everybody worked for GE. And when I was brought up, thatâ€™s what we heard all the time. â€˜Oh, when you get out of high school, you go to GE, you go to GE. â€™â€ he explained. â€œMy cousins went to GE. I went. â€ He started as a stock boy in March of 1967 after high school and moved into the electrician apprentice program before he was drafted in 1968 and went to Vietnam. When he got out, he went back and spent the rest of his working years at the company. â€œThere was no reason to leave because it was a good job,â€ he said. â€œIt was a great job. â€ Don Chapadeau was a lifer at General Electric, too: he started there in 1973 and retired after 42 years. â€œMy father was employed by GE  â€”   he worked in Utica [about 75 miles west of Schenectady]  â€”   and my grandfather was GE,â€ he explained. â€œBack in the 70s, that was the place to be. â€ Like Witkowski, Chapadeau joined the company straight out of high school in 1973. â€œI didnâ€™t want to go to college, I worked with my hands, so it was the place to be,â€ he said. â€œI did everything from clean toilets to build turbines and generators. â€ At the beginning of their downsizing in Schenectady, General Electric wasnâ€™t moving facilities to Mexico or China, though that happened later. They moved manufacturing facilities south, where wages were lower and unions less powerful. â€œThey used to have a motor department there,â€ Witkowski explained. â€œThey moved somewhere south,   shops, lower wages, that was the first big move. â€ But in a vertically integrated manufacturing facility like General Electric used to be, moving one piece of production has downstream effects. â€œPart of that motor division, they had a place where they made their own wire,â€ said Witkowski. â€œThousands of jobs around the clock, making wire for all these motors. So when the motor department went out, the wire mills went out, too. â€ Under the union contracts of the time, those   workers who lost their jobs but had seniority at the company could â€œbumpâ€ less senior workers to stay at GE. â€œLetâ€™s say you were a lathe operator,â€ explained Witkowski. â€œWell, then you could bump a lathe operator somewhere else in the plant, as long as you had more seniority than them. And then that person might have to bump a   job, maybe a sweeper. Eventually, somebody had to go out on the street. â€ Or, as Chapadeau put it, â€œUntil, eventually, there was nobody left for you to bump, you went out of the street. â€ â€œEven though people could bump, the whole population was getting smaller and smaller and smaller,â€ explained Witkowski. â€œIf there was less machinists, then they needed less electricians, less carpenters, less steelworkers, less painters, less maintenance people. â€ â€œI know a lot of people that got laid off that I worked with, maybe they went somewhere to a machine tool company in Albany and worked as electricians,â€ added Witkowski. â€œBut they didnâ€™t make the kind of money they made at GE. They didnâ€™t have the benefits. â€ â€œIn the 80s, we got into [laying off] people with 12, 13 yearsâ€ of service, Chapadeau added. â€œFirst time I got laid off was 85, came back in 86. Then got laid off in 87, came back in 90. â€ By then, he had enough seniority to last until he retired in 2015.  Like Chapadeau, those people who did find work almost always responded to a recall notice, if they got one, because the money and benefits were better at GE  â€”   even if they knew they might get laid off again. â€œI kind of described it like a rollercoaster ride,â€ Witkowski added. The downsizings didnâ€™t just affect people who worked at GE. There were businesses  â€”   like Sears Roebuck, the uniform company Rudnicks and little lunch places  â€”   that stood just outside GEâ€™s gates on Erie Boulevard to cater to   and   workers on their lunch breaks.  â€œThey would run buses from inside the plant and drop you off down in front of Proctors, mainly for the secretaries, who had an hour. Theyâ€™d go to lunch, theyâ€™d go shopping. Thousands of â€™em,â€ Witkowski explained. â€œAnd a lot of people would just walk up Erie Boulevard, the people that had an hour for lunch, and just go. â€ â€œEverybody was out spending money on their lunch hour. And all those stores were thriving,â€ he added. â€œAnd then when they laid everybody off, well, you know what happened with downtown Schenectadyâ€ he said.  Little businesses closed, empty storefronts abounded, nothing seemed to be able to stay in business. â€œWhen you drive by the GE and look out and see green and a running track or a soccer field, thatâ€™s where there was buildings, thatâ€™s where there was jobs,â€ he said. â€œAll those people. Everybody buying homes, buying cars. Even in Schenectady, there was a lot of car dealerships, you would drive up State Street, there was car dealerships. Thatâ€™s all gone, too. â€ The ripples didnâ€™t stop there. Though Phillips, the engineer, wasnâ€™t directly affected by the rounds of layoffs and downsizing, heâ€™s got plenty of examples of the impact on his life as well. â€œWe go to First United Methodist in Schenectady,â€ he explained. â€œWhen GE was booming, church was full of people. â€ â€œOur church will seat about 600, but on a typical Sunday we typically have less than 100,â€ he added. â€œAnd thatâ€™s been a fact of    people donâ€™t work here any more. And the people that do work here, not as many of them live downtown, they live in the suburbs. â€ Schenectady Countyâ€™s population peaked in 1970 by 1980, it had dropped down to below 1960 levels and kept going down until 2000. As the population has begun to grow again, so has median income   â€¦     and the number of people living below the poverty line.  Like Terry Phillipsâ€™s daughters, Bernie Witkowskiâ€™s son and Don Chapadeauâ€™s kids left the area for college and most didnâ€™t come back. Most of their high school classmates who stayed in the area arenâ€™t employed by GE  â€”   but, then, only a handful of people, compared with the early 70s, are employed by GE at all.  Signs of an economic resurgence in Schenectady  â€”   a new multiplex, a shining chain hotel on State Street, the coming casino  â€”   coexist uncomfortably with the areaâ€™s burgeoning homeless and   population, and   houses the city wonâ€™t tear down. Cars line up at the interstate   during the morning commute, and then speed past GE and into Albany.  Schenectady County isnâ€™t a bad place to live nowadays, but itâ€™s not the same as it was. Nobody feels like they have job security, even if median household incomes are rising nobody knows whatâ€™s next for the city, or for housing prices, or what their kids will do for work if they canâ€™t or donâ€™t want to go to college. And everybody has heard the promises from politicians that theyâ€™ll bring jobs back to the area: in 2011, President Obama visited GE with its CEO, Jeffrey Immelt, and talked about modernization and new investment in the facility for renewable energy, spurred on by a $5m grant and a package of tax breaks for the company. In November 2015, GE announced that they were moving that renewable energy business out of Schenectady and into France. The cityâ€™s economic development body nonetheless offered the company a $1. 26m tax break in January 2016, to help them modernize their fitness center, health facilities and landscaping. Theyâ€™ve promised not to cut any more jobs.  â€¢ This article was amended on 9 November 2016. An earlier version said that in 1974 General Electric moved its headquarters to Westport, Connecticut.

We are just a tool, we are just angels that God gave talent to, you know, to get these bad souls back to heaven and cleanse them. â€ The words flow unnervingly from the mouth of the policeman, a senior officer in the Philippines national police (PNP) as he explains his role in 87 killings in the past three months. Itâ€™s not about killing for pleasure, or being a â€œhomicidal maniacâ€ he says. There is a higher purpose at play.  â€œWe are here as angels. Like St Michael and St Gabriel, right,â€ he says. Well in excess of 3, 600 people have been killed in the Philippines since 1 July this year, when Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated as president and initiated his war on drugs and crime. More than half of those murders have been perpetrated by unknown vigilantes. The mass killings have sparked international concern from the United Nations to Barack Obama and his US administration, as well as from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Amnesty has issued warnings about the â€œclimate of lawlessness and fear that has gripped the countryâ€. The fear is that the Philippines has slipped into an era of the death squad. The situation is unlikely to have been helped by the presidentâ€™s own words and allegations made against him. Last week Duterte, after citing Hitler and the Holocaust, said he would happily â€œslaughterâ€ three million drug addicts. That was preceded by a revealing testimony at an ongoing senate inquiry last month, where a   assassin testified that Duterte, in his previous incarnation as the longtime mayor of the city of Davao, had ordered the killing of criminals and his opponents  â€”   and in one case even personally â€œfinished offâ€ an employee from the justice department with a   gun. Reports of such macabre acts have only added weight to stories about assassins currently employed by police to get rid of suspected drug pushers. Now, for the first time, a serving officer is revealing the inner workings of what he claims is an officially sanctioned, albeit secret, campaign to rid the streets of unwanted citizens.  In the past three months he claims dozens of individuals have been killed  â€”   or in Philippine police talk, â€œneutralisedâ€  â€”   by this officer and his â€œspecial opsâ€ team alone. It is the unknown side of Duterteâ€™s dirty drug war  â€”   but it hasnâ€™t come out of nowhere. The police officer sits beyond a beaded curtain in the back room of a Manila brothel as he begins to tell the story of his job. The officer, who the Guardian has independently verified as an active member of the national force, appears at ease here. He feels secure and chose this place to talk. â€œSometimes I just come here for a good nightâ€™s sleep,â€ he jokes, eyeing the single mattress in the nondescript private room, the old air conditioner the only thing on the walls, humming noisily in the tropical heat. Later he says brothels are discreet places for discussions that he doesnâ€™t want anyone to hear. But first he reveals what for many will be shocking details of his employment in a death squad. â€œThey have created us. The term is â€˜they have unleashed the beast from the cageâ€™ right, to neutralise those criminals,â€ he says. The officer claims he is part of one of 10 newly formed and highly secretive police special operations teams, each with 16 members. He claims the teams are coordinated to execute a list of targets: suspected drug users, dealers and criminals. The killings mostly take place at night, he says, with the officers hooded and dressed in all black. They set their watches, giving themselves one minute or two to extract target individuals from their houses and kill on the spot  â€”   swift, precise, no witnesses. He claims they then dump the bodies  â€”   in the next town or under a bridge  â€”   or they plaster masking tape around the head of the corpse and place a cardboard sign on the body that reads â€œdrug lordâ€ or â€œpusherâ€. â€œWe put placards in order for the media, in order for those investigating [the] bodies to redirect their investigation,â€ he explains, leading them to think: â€œâ€˜Why should I investigate this guy, he is a drug pusher, he is a rapist, never mind with that one, I will just investigate the others. Itâ€™s a good thing for him that happened to him. â€™â€ In the Philippines they have a term for it: â€œsalvageâ€ victim. Someone killed and dumped in the street or thrown in the river. A corpse that is later salvaged. There have been many killings lately, the officer jokes, that these days you can easily get away with any kind of murder: â€œYou can kill him, put masking tape on him and everybody is going to think that guy is a drug pusher. â€ The officer says he was first deployed just after Duterte was elected to his special operations team, which was being formed for national security. He recalls his first meeting in which superiors allegedly described what was to happen next. â€œAnd then they are briefing us that, â€˜From now on it will be a different story. All those pending cases that identified hardened criminals on drugs and hardened murderers, we are going to have to neutralise them, so thatâ€™s the order. We need your special skills. â€™â€ He says the team leader is contacted via radio and a specific code  â€”   each special ops officer is known by a numeric code  â€”   and told to report to base. There they are given a dossier of targets, files of drug dealers, users and criminals to â€œneutraliseâ€. â€œLike, for example, they will send us a picture, a profile of this individual,â€ explains the officer. â€œAutomatically, one or two of my team will go to the place where this individual dwells and then of course first we are going to conduct background checks. â€ The team investigates the individuals to determine whether they are involved in drug dealing or other illegal activities, whether they are â€œ â€ or a â€œparasiteâ€ and then acts accordingly. â€œSo thatâ€™s how we weigh him, so maybe we conduct our own justice,â€ he says. â€œAnd of course the government is ordering us to do so. â€ The officer, dressed in a red sports shirt and jeans, argues the special ops teams are doing a service for society, perhaps giving a hint at his motivation for speaking about such a sensitive subject. â€œWe are the kind of policemen that we donâ€™t just kill for pleasure,â€ he explains. â€œBut if we think this is a hardened individual or hardened criminal who makes his living as a parasite to others, well we will have no conscience. We are going to give him the worst death [so] that even Satan cannot look straightforward to him because he has a very bad death. â€ The allegations from the officer are shocking. And although the Guardian can verify the policemanâ€™s rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder. The environment in which the wave of killings is happening in the Philippines is murky and complicated, with several groups involved. First, under operation â€œDouble Barrelâ€ the police have been given a licence from the president to crack down on drugs and crime. Duterte has instructed the police to double, â€œtriple their efforts if need beâ€ and promised to grant amnesty to any officers involved if they somehow find themselves on the wrong side of the law as a result. Next come the vigilantes, and the more than 2, 200 murders perpetrated by these unknown assassins. The deaths have been put down to gangs, thugs and drug lords capitalising on the killing spree to get rid of rivals and enemies. The police have also admitted that corrupt officers, with the aim of protecting their narcotics rackets, could also be behind some of the vigilante killings. Then, most frightening and ominous, according to the officer who spoke to the Guardian, is the third category  â€”   highly orchestrated and trained   police death squads, such as the one this officer claims to be part of. For months now the news has been filled with a steady stream of grisly images, daily photographs of   dead bodies shot and slumped in the street. One local newspaper, the Inquirer, has even started a â€œkill listâ€ in an attempt to document the killings across the country. Of the   deaths so far, 1, 375 have been killed in   police operations, while about 2, 233 more have been put down to vigilantes, according to the latest statistics from the PNP from early September. The PNP says it is investigating the vigilantes, but so far there are no reports that any have been arrested. Inaugurated on 30 June, Duterte had been elected on a promise to rid the   Asian nation of drugs and crime within six months of taking office. The president has joked about fattening up the fish of Manila Bay with the corpses of drug dealers, and vowed the drug war wonâ€™t stop â€œuntil the last drug lord, last financier and last pusher have surrendered  â€”   or put behind bars, or below the ground if they so wishâ€. But it is not just the surge in killings on his watch that has invited international condemnation. Duterteâ€™s penchant for outlandish statements and insults, even of global leaders, has stunned the global community. Ahead of a planned meeting with the US president, Barack Obama, on the sidelines of an Asean meeting in Laos this August, Duterte branded his US counterpart a â€œson of a whoreâ€ for signalling his intention to talk about human rights amid the spate of killings.  Before that it was UN officials and the US ambassador to the Philippines. In June it was the press. â€œJust because youâ€™re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if youâ€™re a son of a bitch,â€ he said. He later retracted that, saying he did not condone the killing of journalists, and he also rowed back on his Obama comments, saying the insult was not directed at the president. It was the same with the Jewish community too and his Holocaust comment. Duterte, after the fact, apparently didnâ€™t mean what he said. But the more criticism that flies in from abroad, the more impervious the president has become  â€”   warning global leaders not to mess with Philippine sovereignty, while setting out to undermine and publicly ridicule anyone who questions him. So far he appears to have the public on his side  â€”   a July poll by Pulse Asia Research showed his approval rating at 91%. Indeed, in Manila talk of   death squads doesnâ€™t raise many eyebrows. â€œOnly in the Philippinesâ€ was an   refrain. As mayor of Davao, a city in Mindanao in the southern Philippines, Duterte developed a reputation both for curbing crime and for links to the alleged Davao death squads (DDS) that executed drug dealers, petty criminals and street children, some of whom were part of gangs. Impunity for such crimes was almost absolute according to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Entitled You Can Die At Any Time, it detailed evidence of complicity and at times direct involvement between government officials and the police in the squads. That same year Duterte said that criminals were a â€œlegitimate target of assassinationâ€. According to the report, police officers would give death squad members lists of targets. After being notified of the murders by members of the public, authorities were slow to respond, even when they occurred just minutes away from police stations. The report describes how the Davao police often failed to collect obvious pieces of evidence such as used bullet casings or question witnesses or suspects, instead pressuring the families of victims to identify the killers. Investigations went nowhere. In 2012 the Commission on Human Rights recommended the ombudsman investigate Duterte for criminal liability in relation to the killings, but no charges were ever brought and no evidence found. Instead 21 police officers were reportedly fined the equivalent of one monthâ€™s salary after they were found guilty of neglecting their duty.  The chief of the PNP, Ronald dela Rosa  â€”   the former city police chief of Davao who was handpicked for the national job by Duterte  â€”   has, like the government, denied the existence of the DDS.  Even after the stunning allegations at the senate hearing when Duterteâ€™s name was directly linked to mass killings, Dela Rosa dismissed the DDS as a â€œcreation of the mediaâ€. Davao is not the only place where it is claimed that death squads have operated and the concern now is that the tactics allegedly used in that city have been scaled up nationwide.  â€œI think itâ€™s extremely credible,â€ says Brad Adams, the executive director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch, speaking both about that notion and the claims of the police officer in his Guardian interview. â€œThat police officers are given a list of targets to kill is not shocking or surprising. It is however important, essential, that the police admit this so that Duterte canâ€™t hide behind the idea that this is all the work of vigilantes and   actors. â€œThere is no doubt there is state sponsorship and police involvement,â€ Adams claims. â€œWe were concerned about Davao being replicated or metastasising around the country. â€. At the Philippines national police headquarters, even the police themselves admit active officers could be behind a number of the vigilante killings. A police briefing document on project Double Barrel shows that from 1 July to 16 August, 250 officers were relieved from their duties in metro Manila because of suspected links to the drug trade. But any official relationship between police and vigilantes  â€”   such as the one described by the officer to the Guardian  â€”   are denied. The Philippine National Police was contacted on numerous occasions by the Guardian to comment on the allegations detailed in this story. Although they did acknowledge requests from the Guardian regarding the matter, no official comment was forthcoming. But the previous responses from Duterte himself to allegations of involvement in death squads have been strong. He has called them lies and â€œaccusations of a madmanâ€ and previously stated that there were â€œno Davao death squadsâ€. Martin Andanar, Duterteâ€™s communications secretary, said of the Davao allegations: â€œThe Commission on Human Rights already conducted an investigation years ago, when the president was still a mayor, and charges were not filed, they did not see any direct evidence. â€ When contacted by the Guardian to respond to the specific allegations of the police officer, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said he was unable to comment. â€œI cannot make any comments regarding that,â€ he said. â€œThere are   sources and we cannot verify what they are saying, they have not made an affidavit. I cannot make any statement because it is not verified. â€ For Arsenio â€œBoyâ€ Evangelista Jr, spokesman for the group Victims against Crime and Corruption, the denials and no comments mean little. â€œWho would have the skills and the guts to do this?â€ he says when he talks about the mass killings. â€œI am talking of police skills, all the skills, like intelligence, proficiency in handling firearms,â€ says Evangelista, who six years after his son was killed in a brutal crime is still waiting for someone to be charged. â€œBecause thatâ€™s what is happening lately. Itâ€™s practically perfect. No witnesses  â€”   it is being done very accurate, swift. â€ At the Philippines Commission on Human Rights, Chito Gascon, its chairman, is asked about the allegations of police acting as judge, jury and executioner. He too is unfazed. â€œI am not surprised, I have heard of this. But the problem is we need to prove it. â€œAnd it probably follows a playbook that has been used before, like in Davao. â€ Gascon says he is grappling with the new presidentâ€™s apparent take on human rights: if youâ€™re a good guy, you get them if youâ€™re a bad guy, you donâ€™t. Itâ€™s a slippery slope but this appears to be the logic at the heart of the surge in killings: the justification necessary to rid the country of the scourge of drugs and crime, the end that justifies the means. In his Manila brothel the police officer admits that he too contemplates that very point. â€œMaybe, I am just having, what do you call it, just pretending that we are right. But we are not homicidal maniacs right now. â€œI told you a while ago, we pray, we always go to the church, and ask forgiveness to God for what we are doing right now. We are sorry for doing it. But whoever gonna do it for the Filipino people?â€",813,932,9.13E+17,fake

Papers filed in a Washington DC federal court on Tuesday allege that DynCorp, a fixture of wartime US contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, knowingly inflated costs during a   stretch when the company held a contract with the US state department for training Iraqi police. Since 2010, DynCorp has held a contract with the US defense department for training Afghanistanâ€™s ministry of defense and its own national police. DynCorp essentially inherited that contract thanks to a prior deal for the same Afghan police training with the state department that began in 2003.  The company received an extension on that contract in March under limited competition. Although in the past the contract was worth approximately $1bn over three years, the dollar value on the reaward, a far shorter period, was redacted.  While the justice department does not precisely estimate how much the alleged fraud cost the US, it states that DynCorpâ€™s deal for the services at issue in the filing led to the firm receiving $135m from the state department.  In a statement provided to the Guardian, DynCorp said it was â€œdisappointedâ€ by the fraud accusation and â€œlooks forward to responding to the complaintâ€™s allegations in courtâ€.  The fraud allegation against DynCorp stems from a subcontractor it used, Corporate Bank, during a period from 2004 to 2008 when it held the Iraqi police training contract. According to the justice department complaint, DynCorp was aware that rates from the subcontractor  â€”   for hotels for US government officials, local security personnel, drivers and interpreters  â€”   were â€œunreasonableâ€ yet the firm billed them to the state department anyway. â€œDynCorpâ€™s invoices, which reflected these inflated subcontractor rates, and DynCorpâ€™s own fees and   were false and fraudulent claims,â€ the complaint alleges.  DynCorp, which provides private security guards as well as aviation and logistics services, was not among seven contractors awarded state department contracts in February to protect its diplomats. It was a departure for state, which has included the security company on its previous awards of its Worldwide Protective Services contract, most recently in 2010.  Yet the firm currently holds contracts with the US department of defense, according to a federal contracting database, atop the Afghanistan interior ministry training deal.  Among them is an air force contract for supplying materiel relevant to a training aircraft for which DynCorp was the sole bidder, and an army contract for support services at a base in Honduras. A different contract, with the navy for maintenance on test aircraft, is set to expire on 31 July.  According to the justice department complaint, DynCorp management called its subcontractor Corporate Bankâ€™s labor and hotel rates â€œexpensiveâ€ during an internal presentation, without the subcontractor providing evidence justifying the costs. DynCorp allegedly presented those rates to the state department as justified by â€œhistorical dataâ€ or a â€œvendor quoteâ€ and is alleged to have billed the government for unoccupied hotel rooms. In 2005, according to the complaint, a DynCorp   worried that the company â€œwould not win the CIVPOL [civilian police] Iraq business back if we allow these outrageous rates to continueâ€. As well as the hotel costs, Corporate Bank is alleged to have inflated the labor costs for personnel it supplied DynCorp for security and transport, resulting in the state department paying what the complaint says is over $1m in false claims while DynCorp â€œprofited by recovering its own markups and fees on its subcontractorâ€™s inflated chargesâ€. DynCorp, in a statement, denied the justice departmentâ€™s allegations. The company said it stopped doing business with Corporate Bank â€œmany years agoâ€ and claimed that the US government itself proposed using the subcontractor. â€œThe suit is an    attempt to   certain labor and housing costs charged nearly a decade ago by a subcontractor in Iraq which was recommended to DynCorp International by the US government,â€ DynCorpâ€™s statement said.  The Afghan police, which DynCorp still has a role in training and mentoring, have long faced criticism for corruption and unreliable performance. A US government watchdog testified in February that its audits indicated the police claiming payroll for nonexistent employees. DynCorpâ€™s latest contract extension lasts through September, with options for two   extensions. ",453,502,8.84E+17,fake

A report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office harshly criticized the FBI last week for its little discussed but frequently used facial recognition database and called on the bureau to implement myriad privacy and safety protections. It turns out the database has far more photos than anyone thought  â€”   411. 9m to be exact  â€”   and the vast majority are not mugshots of criminals, but driverâ€™s license photos from over a dozen states and passport photos of millions of completely innocent people. The feds searched it over 36, 000 times from 2011 to 2015 (no court order needed) while also apparently having no idea how accurate it is. Worse, the FBI wants its hundreds of millions of facial recognition photos  â€”   along with its entire biometric database that includes fingerprints and DNA profiles  â€”   to be exempt from important Privacy Act protections. As the Intercept reported two weeks ago: â€œSpecifically, the FBIâ€™s proposal would exempt the database from the provisions in the Privacy Act that require federal agencies to share with individuals the information they collect about them and that give people the legal right to determine the accuracy and fairness of how their personal information is collected and used. â€ In Congress, Senate Republicans are pushing for a vote this week on controversial new warrantless surveillance measures that would let the FBI use unconstitutional National Security Letters to get email records and internet browsing history from countless US citizens  â€”   without going to a judge or court at all. The Senate leadership is bringing the measure up to vote by invoking the Orlando attack, despite the fact that we know the FBI had no problem surveilling the Orlando killer when he was previously investigated. It is a blatant attempt to exploit the tragedy in order to gain powers the FBI has long asked for (powers, by the way, the FBI is already reportedly using, despite the justice department telling them itâ€™s basically illegal). The justice department, meanwhile, is busy attempting to implement a new rule for the court system that would make it much easier for the FBI to hack into computers worldwide  â€”   including those of hacking victims. Using the obscure process for amending the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the department has convinced the courts that they should be able to get one warrant to potentially hack thousands of computers, and shouldnâ€™t have to comply with the normal rules involving getting the court order in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation has noted, â€œthis is a recipe for disaster,â€ and it is being done by circumventing the normal democratic process. Several organizations (including Freedom of the Press Foundation, the organization I work for) have called on Congress to put a stop to it. Also in the courts, the justice department has continued to argue that the US government doesnâ€™t need a warrant to gather the cell phone location information of Americans  â€”   even though that type of information can give authorities your precise whereabouts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The justice department convinced the fourth circuit court of appeals last month to overturn its previous ruling that police need a probable cause warrant to get such information. The court agreed with the justice department that cellphone users donâ€™t have a â€œreasonable expectation of privacyâ€ around their location, even though it is some of the most intimate information that exists, giving law enforcement officials a detailed picture of your life that even your close friends and family may not know. Last year, the FBI director disingenuously tried to claim that the pendulum â€œhas swung too farâ€ in the way of privacy, despite the fact that the agency has virtually unprecedented access to all sorts of information on Americans. If it wasnâ€™t clear before, it should be now: they plan on using any means necessary to further erode the rights of hundreds of millions of citizens in their crusade against privacy.",703,640,"826037076760084481	826049920012541953	826051668810858496	826057997545791489	826060347182297089	826076567516434432	826077750616322048	826080806871375873	826097370526003203	826104139176349696	826108827074494464	826110779409707008	826120745818406913	826125279647166466	826138484167626752	826145365065822208	826145872228519937	826148736715853824	826156355031494657	826160198620479488	826169211806478336	826173570497835008	826176170253094912	826213505376350212	826214136920973312	826220916115959813	826224237946032129	826258703116595200	826266493000286209	826279608924438529	826306903307325440	826345610307571713	826362254954287104	826371532003930112	826371713554345984	826374596882472960	826377732535771137	826383602107686912	826400758706872320	826404852540567552	826431410462457857	826433420213497861	826455180614983683	826466914771808261	826495987296382976	826515414037446656	826543868111896577	826560478772027392	826617217940877312	826623789261844481	826669053959880704	826697279318925313	826734047082717184	826735981852254209	826772171804512256	826779805450399744	826860705924145153	826890582333222915	826920499066372097	827136738183241728	827163674552971264	827223529787686913	827223617851228161	827223815495229440	827361285079699456	827460471540310017	827631259950125056	827641458467434496	827788225381019648	828022817799168000	828071402578313217	828283537178624000	830385901129838592	832629030822109184	847196408469970948	847388048182476801	876770928096661504	935454719438356480	941436937281425409	942369454805192704	942410633240371201	942454899299713025	942455072633573377	955559489305968642",fake

A post to his official Facebook page on Thursday 10 November announced the musicianâ€™s passing in Los Angeles. â€œIt is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away. We have lost one of musicâ€™s most revered and prolific visionaries,â€ the post said.  â€œA memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief. â€ According to the Leonard Cohen forum, often well informed on the singer, he died on Monday 7 November and has already been buried in a private ceremony in Montreal. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Cohen spoke about the prospect of death with calmness and clarity: â€œI am ready to die. I hope itâ€™s not too uncomfortable. Thatâ€™s about it for me. â€ Tributes poured in across social media for the Canadian musician, who had just released his 14th album, You Want It Darker, in October, to great acclaim. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said the â€œworld will miss himâ€ while  actors Rob Lowe and Russell Crowe, musicians Ben Folds, Peter Hook, Slash, Carole King, Lily Allen and Bette Midler all heaped praise on the star. Cohen, who was born in Montreal, came to prominence in the 1960s as a poet, novelist and  . Originally focusing on literary pursuits, he shifted his attention to music in the late 60s when he moved to New York. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in 1967 and became a cult hit. Cohenâ€™s influence on the music industry has been likened to that of his contemporaries Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell and is perhaps best known for his song Hallelujah. Only a modest hit on its release in 1984, it found a much wider audience after it was covered by John Cale in 1991 and by Jeff Buckley in 1994.  After the song was taken to No 1 in the UK by   winner Alexandra Burke in 2008, Cohen said: â€œI think itâ€™s a good song, but I think too many people sing it. â€ Despite his immense popularity, Cohen often appeared to be shy of the stage. Judy Collins, who had success with his song Suzanne, once described how she had to coax him back on stage after he left halfway through a performance. He came out of retirement in his late 70s to embark what would end up being a   worldwide tour, after his former manager, Kelley Lynch, was found guilty of stealing millions of dollars from him.  Cohen recently wrote a letter to his longtime muse, Marianne Ihlen, who was the subject of his songs So Long, Marianne, and Bird on a Wire, saying: â€œYou know that Iâ€™ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I donâ€™t need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road. â€ For much of the 1960s, he lived with Ihlen on the Greek island of Hydra, during which time he wrote numerous books of poetry, including his experimental novel Beautiful Losers, and his first album.  In the 1970s, after his relationship with Ihlen dissolved, Cohen began a relationship with the artist Suzanne Elrod. The couple had two children, Adam and Lorca.  You Want It Darker was   by Adam Cohen. Speaking recently with CBC Radio host Tom Power, he talked about working with his father on the album that many believed would be his last. â€œThis old man, who was truly in pain and discomfort, would at some intervals get out of his medical chair and dance in front of his speakers,â€ he said. â€œAnd sometimes, we would put on a song and listen to it on repeat just like teenagers, with the help of medical marijuana. â€œI think in states of pain and discomfort, what do you seek with more energy and more clarity than joy and jubilance?â€ Adam described his father as â€œthe last of his kindâ€. â€œUnlike so many from that golden era, from which he comes, heâ€™s not a nostalgia act,â€ he said. â€œThis guy is speaking from his particular vantage point, heâ€™s speaking about things that are meaningful to him at his particular rung in life  â€”   he will be leaving a giant void when he leaves us. â€  You Want It Darker added to an impressive body of work. Cohenâ€™s second album, 1969â€™s Songs for a Room, featured what would become one of his most popular songs, Bird on the Wire. The song has been covered by artists including Johnny Cash, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, kd lang and Paul Kelly. Kris Kristofferson once said that he wanted the opening lyrics from Bird on the Wire engraved on his tombstone. A year later, Cohen embarked upon an intense period of touring through Europe, Canada and the United States. He released his third album, Songs of Love and Hate, in 1971, which included the song Famous Blue Raincoat. The song, with its haunting depiction of the aftermath of a love triangle, was   by fans, but Cohen reportedly told BBC in 1994 that he was never quite happy with the lyrics. Cohenâ€™s next two albums, New Skin for the Old Ceremony and Death of a Ladiesâ€™ Man, marked a shift to a new sound and a dip in his popularity. The latter was also an album fuelled by controversy at one point during recording, producer Phil Spector reportedly held a gun to Cohenâ€™s head in the studio. In addition to giving his song Hallelujah a major boost, covers played a significant role and helped Cohen find a new audience in the late 80s, when the American artist Jennifer Warnes released a tribute album to him, effectively refashioning his image in the public eye. Cohen was born into a Jewish family, but in the 1970s he began to devote significant attention to studying Buddhism. He met and became a disciple of Joshu Sasaki Roshi, a Zen Buddhist monk. Between 1994 and 1999, Cohen lived as the monkâ€™s friend and student at the Mount Baldy Zen Center in Los Angeles. Cohen continued to record and tour in the 1980s and early 90s. He released his album Ten New Songs in 2001, after emerging from the monastery, launching a new phase of his already   career.  Cohen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.

politifact15095,http://actionnews3.com/legendary-actor-kirk-douglas-dead-age-100/,"Legendary Actor Kirk Douglas Dead, 4 Days Before His 101st Birthday","Whatever the Trump era represents, it surely marks the dawn of a golden age of satire. But beware of laughing too much: the joke might be on us. Yes, Trump tweets like a buffoon. But we should not assume that all the missteps by the petulant    are down to ignorance: they arenâ€™t. Too many of Trumpâ€™s troubling tweets arenâ€™t actually gaffes. He is intentionally blowing up global stability for the sake of an extremist agenda concocted by hawkish aides who make Dick Cheney look like Kofi Annan. Thatâ€™s why the strange case of the Taiwan telephone call is worth examining because it is surely a sign of things to come. At first, Team Trump dismissed the call with the Taiwanese president Tsai   as an innocent congratulatory message. Mike Pence, the   elect, suggested it was no big deal, telling ABC it was â€œnothing more than taking a courtesy callâ€.  These excuses seemed weak after foreign policy experts predicted the Taiwan call would lead to a major breach with US policy, which has been in place since 1979. Then, they fell apart after the New York Times reported that the call was the result of a   and   lobbying effort by the Taiwanese themselves. According to the New York Times, it was all orchestrated by its paid foreign agent, Bob Dole, the former Republican presidential nominee and Senate leader. â€œItâ€™s fair to say that we had some influence,â€ Dole said. â€œWhen you represent a client, and they make requests, youâ€™re supposed to respond. â€ That influence included special attention at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, attended by a Taiwanese delegation, where the party platform was changed for the first time to include several commitments to Taiwanâ€™s security. Another   might consider such   from national security dangerous, disloyal or worse. But Taiwan newspapers have reported that the Trump Organization itself is interested in a possible hotel project close to Taiwanâ€™s international airport. According to the report, a sales manager visited Taiwan as recently as October, although a spokeswoman for the business said there were â€œno plans for expansion into Taiwan. â€ Perhaps the Taiwan phone call is as innocent as Trumpâ€™s meeting with his Indian business partners just days before his business signed a new deal in Kolkata. Perhaps his phone call with the Argentine president has nothing to do with the   of a   Buenos Aires tower. Trump could sweep aside such questions by divesting himself entirely from his ownership of the Trump Organization, and not just stepping away from its operations, as he has suggested he will do at a big league press conference next week. Anything short of full divestment  â€”   even a blind trust  â€”   will be meaningless. Under the US constitutionâ€™s prohibition against payments and benefits from foreign powers to the president, every piece of planning permission and investment would be grounds for impeachment. In any case, these phone calls and policy shifts are beginning to follow a pattern, whether or not Ivanka Trump is taking part. First there is a stunned reaction from foreign policy experts and the media at the brazen disregard for protocol and national interest. Then there is an attempt to explain away the dramatic shift as an inexperienced gaffe. Finally there is a realization that we have all been gamed by a manipulative and secret coterie that is in fact Trumpâ€™s inner circle. So it was that Trump himself explained the Taiwan call initially as him casually picking up the phone. â€œThe President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency,â€ he tweeted last week. â€œThank you!â€ It wasnâ€™t clear who he was thanking in that tweet, but it was clear soon afterwards that the story was falling apart.  At which point, Trumpâ€™s excuse on Twitter turned towards punishing China: â€œDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the US doesnâ€™t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I donâ€™t think so!â€ We could argue all day about international taxes, and how the US actually imposes tariffs on Chinese goods. But whatâ€™s the point of talking about the facts with a man like Donald Trump? What matters much more are his motives, and for now they go far beyond the notion that heâ€™s a simpleton. We may have returned to the satirical heyday of Will Ferrellâ€™s George W Bush, but the jokes donâ€™t tell the full story.  Trump has a personal and political agenda that are far from the clueless caricatures that puncture his   skin. The sooner we wake up to that punchline, the better.",238,481,"938641698229489664	938747477829804033	938757438655774720	938764271210651649	938767671419723776	938772730698194945	938773966415695873	938774096409714688	938776359404474368	938802993406906368	938805502267535360	938808405300453376	938808676386820096	938812776994299905	938820735627382784	938820928124760064	938822968368492544	938824494277382145	938833679966724098	938846327953338368	938847786723721217	938850855004114944	938853281757040640	938856342525267968	938861249135181829	938864233130938370	938868036320333824	938872124663648261	938872638784589824	938883915997003776	938893641623379968	938897539939622912	938897747960147968	938898238584905728	938898677585924098	938899135222120448	938901069857296384	938901450486194178	938904497564332032	938910170310201345	938911020176760832	938913459043028992	938913704464277504	938913968285933568	938915530446163970	938924136533020672	938929673886687233	938932035833483264	938932614202888193	938934556685688837	938936851754299392	938943145256951809	938945388005834752	938945618428465152	938949282593427456	938964270846324736	938966355113422849	938971386290286593	938975251597324290	938975483269603328	938976634165760000	938977258500513793	938983701559562241	938985629706342400	938986398517989376	938989272673038337	938992456309252097	938996858810114048	939011883503202304	939012774809649157	939015497101619200	939019437314732032	939030991481356288	939038927687524352	939041305946087424	939042123793416193	939042365754560512	939045959471902720	939052254190960640	939065797602836480	939071160729395201	939071504511356930	939088428913905665	939089542946148352	939090145046941696	939103846944649217	939104223320518656	939108128473452546	939109085114445825	939110957476855809	939114228782456832	939121027346567169	939121618005131264	939126927771742209	939128609603837952	939135202609295360	939136560112504833	939147417693368320	939149676523044865	939165890129612802	939173229616234496	939187505068494850	939188710217744385	939190286630178816	939194381306925056	939195775992647680	939200645235535874	939202032573001728	939214783546568704	939229277916188672	939238403555684355	939242385829179392	939245255504703488	939250825230278658	939254584983162880	939255135422820354	939257155345149953	939258720332197888	939259516079583232	939261677610192896	939272695824502784	939279199784779776	939282511221358592	939283738944589824	939294864914702337	939301068504256512	939314972299091968	939315331805384704	939331165227380736	939348683774222336	939350534242426880	939394134497951745	939399439969501186	939426095337795584	939436393549455361	939443111964446720	939444718097838080	939445259196665856	939452517724950528	939452871325700096	939454705775849472	939458996943183873	939462463136903168	939462730238562306	939473679024574465	939478757240393738	939478899540615168	939500906067976193	939528110780841984	939534265439662080	939541326571474945	939544215079530496	939553909160513536	939567669258391553	939572021188538369	939592084230688768	939597897401761792	939618918368530432	939624696554733568	939647612269064197	939678365832957952	939696502611484674	939708926618152960	939716891219845125	939718248215535616	939719384435748864	939728451845500933	939748009767768064	939756391090278400	939818352230522881	939819396909928448	939866330743951361	939889764190294016	939901258269421568	939902990147764224	939924791091326977	939924947585191944	939949736307642368	939958676567314433	940075295444410369	940127625653219328	940283057264881664	940359138130796544	944953638904004608",fake

But some fans at the University of Georgia were unimpressed. The   UGA hashtag on Twitter gives the flag of the Uganda, the large east African country. Not the University of Georgia, the public university in the town of Athens. (The University of Georgia goes by UGA for short, obviously). Theyâ€™ve stolen our hashtag! Obviously some supporters were in on the joke, and tweeted tongue in cheek. But some seemed annoyed. And some didnâ€™t really seem to notice. Oh well. The Bulldogs still have the #dawgs hashtag, so itâ€™s not the end of the world. Just donâ€™t use the #GEO hashtag for Georgia  â€”   thatâ€™ll open up a whole new can of

politifact15352,https://dailyworldupdate.us/2018/05/01/breaking-hillary-clinton-killed-in-monster-truck-mishap/,BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Killed In Monster Truck Mishap,"The Â£50, 000 Marcus Willis collected in two matches at Wimbledon this week sounds like the sort of money that would encourage young players across the country to rush to their nearest tennis club and start swinging a racket. The reality, as Willis and Andy Murray know, is somewhat different. Murray, the world No2, has just been voted on to the ATP playersâ€™ council and hopes he can do some good for players on the outer fringes of the game. As he prepared for his   match against the world No76 Lu    â€”   who embarrassed him at the Beijing Olympics in 2008  â€”   Murray reflected on the dilemma facing the   Willis, No772 in the world, as well as other   British players such as Liam Broady, whom he defeated in three sets on Tuesday. â€œThe first thing is we need to improve the prize money at Futures level,â€ Murray said of the lowest rung of menâ€™s professional tennis. â€œI think itâ€™s stayed the same since the 1980s, but the cost of everything has gone up massively since then, so itâ€™s impossible to stay at that level for more than a couple of years. â€ Willis revealed that he returned from his last proper tournament, in Tunisia in January, with just â‚¬60. â€œYou are losing money unless you are winning each week,â€ Murray added. â€œSo, for the guys that are stuck there for a couple of years, playing   and   you simply cannot fund your career that way. â€œThe first thing is you have to improve the prize money at the lowest level. Itâ€™s been going up everywhere else, at the top of the game, massively. But that hasnâ€™t filtered down to the bottom of the game. Thatâ€™s something that needs to change. â€ Was there a danger, then, that talented players could disappear under the radar? Murray was unequivocal. â€œPlayers are breaking through later than they ever were before, they are finding ways to hang around. A lot of the guys play club tennis [as Willis does, in Germany and France] to try to make some extra money, which helps. We donâ€™t have that in this country. You can travel to Europe and do that. In Spain they have a few more money tournaments. â€œSomeone like Marcus, if he had lost in the   at Wimbledon, we wouldnâ€™t have this unbelievable story and he might not be coming back to play [on the Tour] in January. You never know. â€œThere has to be more money at the bottom of the game. Some of the $10, 000 tournaments, they have a   qualifying draw and itâ€™s $30 to enter the qualifying. Thatâ€™s a lot of money that doesnâ€™t go to the players. The players at that level really need the money. â€ That said, Murray will not be gifting Lu Â£80, 000 here on Thursday to advance into the third round. Murray has started at a great lick, beating Broady in just an hour and 42 minutes, and needs another quick win to settle into the tournament  â€”   unlike his slow start to the French Open last week. And he has the incentive of getting square for losing to Lu in in Beijing, when he got caught up in the euphoria of the occasion. That will not happen in Rio, he promised. â€œI learned that I was there to play tennis and not just enjoy being part of the Olympics. I turned up late because I had won Cincinnati. I did the opening ceremony and I was hanging out with a lot of the other athletes, stayed in the village. It was great, a great experience. But, when I lost, I was gutted. I realised that my job at the Olympics is to try to win a medal for the country. â€ That is the main reason he will stay with his team away from the village this time. â€œYeah, and I donâ€™t know what the accommodation is like   either. â€œIdeally you would go to the opening ceremony and stay in the Olympic Village. But that didnâ€™t work for me in Beijing. At the Olympics in London, I stayed at home. I was just a lot more focused and in my own little bubble. It was one of the best weeks of my life, so Iâ€™m not going to change that this time. â€ Murray and his Taiwanese opponent have other history, which is more encouraging for the Scot: each time he has played Lu in a Tour event or slam, he has gone on to win it, here in 2013 and at Queenâ€™s last year. â€œI didnâ€™t remember that I played him last year,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m not superstitious like that. â€",299,131,"991523587638087685	991596426240167936	991596700035895296	991614084809404417	991614894138056705	991681732385673216	991681786664144896	991682664204787712	991683256373391361	991683274396270593	991684591533608960	991685537298821120	991698835318620160	991704899569242112	991704952027348993	991705863151800322	991707397461688320	991708129514536960	991708139371163648	991709416847065088	991712408333938690	991716486615052290	991719701247016960	991755645115396099	991769416374382592	991848424570994688	991853632545959937	991870273254125568	992535806517669890	993023000944443392	993146643733151745",fake

In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Putin also said Trump will â€œquickly realizeâ€ his responsibilities as the next leader of the United States. â€œTrump was a businessman and an entrepreneur,â€ Putin told Russiaâ€™s NTV network. â€œTodayâ€™s heâ€™s already a state actor, already head of the United States of America, one of the worldâ€™s leading nations, one of the worldâ€™s leading economies, leading military powers. â€œHe could achieve success in business, which says that heâ€™s a smart man. And if heâ€™s a smart man, that means that heâ€™ll fully and quickly enough realize this different level of responsibility. We expect that he will act with this perspective in mind. â€ On Thursday, in his annual state of the nation address, Putin said he hoped to mend   relations after years of bitter disagreement, economic sanctions and conflict via opposing factions, as in Syria and Ukraine.  â€œWe are ready to cooperate with the new American administration,â€ Putin told lawmakers and officials at the Kremlin. â€œItâ€™s important to normalize and start to develop our bilateral relations on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. â€ Trump, who has been accused of being too close to the Putin regime, has said he wants â€œto get along with Russiaâ€ and restore military cooperation in the Middle East.  In the interview broadcast on Sunday, Putin said western leaders should listen more closely to views from governments in Russia and the Middle East. â€œThey listen to those whose voices are loud enough to be heard,â€ he said. â€œAnd if itâ€™s some insignificant issue in international relations, then, of course, you can save face. But the game will still turn out poorly with regard to those who were not considered important enough partners. â€ In his speech, Putin said he expected to work with the US in the Middle East, where Russian forces have for months bombed Syrian cities that are not under the control of his ally, Bashar  .  Barack Obama has called for Assad to step down, but US efforts to negotiate with Russia and Syria  â€”   while fighting jihadi groups and supporting rebels  â€”   have repeatedly failed. â€œOf course I am counting on joining forces with the United States in the fight with the real, not invented, threat of international terrorism,â€ Putin said. Last month, in their first phone call after the US election, Trump and Putin spoke about cooperation and â€œthe principles of equality, mutual respect and   in the internal affairs of each otherâ€ according to a Kremlin account of the call.  Russian officials have long accused counterparts in the Obama administration of meddling abroad, for instance in 2011, when Putin claimed that Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, was fomenting dissent against him within Russia. Trumpâ€™s transition team said the   told Putin he was â€œvery much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russiaâ€. Officials in the Obama administration accused Russia of hacking Democratic party servers as a ploy to interfere with the election, which Putin denied. Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Putinâ€™s â€œstrongâ€ leadership. Trump also falsely said that Putin had called him â€œa geniusâ€. The Russian president actually called Trump â€œflamboyantâ€ and â€œtalentedâ€. Trumpâ€™s foreign policy intentions remain largely unknown, and in his Thursday speech Putin did not fully embrace the  . He warned, for instance, that the US and Russia had a â€œshared responsibilityâ€ to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, a nod to Trumpâ€™s suggestion that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear arms.  â€œAttempts to break strategic parity are extremely dangerous,â€ Putin said.

Yet plagues of anxiety, stress, depression, social phobia, eating disorders,   and loneliness now strike people down all over the world. The latest, catastrophic figures for childrenâ€™s mental health in England reflect a global crisis. There are plenty of secondary reasons for this distress, but it seems to me that the underlying cause is everywhere the same: human beings, the ultrasocial mammals, whose brains are wired to respond to other people, are being peeled apart. Economic and technological change play a major role, but so does ideology. Though our wellbeing is inextricably linked to the lives of others, everywhere we are told that we will prosper through competitive   and extreme individualism. In Britain, men who have spent their entire lives in quadrangles  â€”   at school, at college, at the bar, in parliament  â€”   instruct us to stand on our own two feet. The education system becomes more brutally competitive by the year. Employment is a fight to the   with a multitude of other desperate people chasing ever fewer jobs. The modern overseers of the poor ascribe individual blame to economic circumstance. Endless competitions on television feed impossible aspirations as real opportunities contract. Consumerism fills the social void. But far from curing the disease of isolation, it intensifies social comparison to the point at which, having consumed all else, we start to prey upon ourselves. Social media brings us together and drives us apart, allowing us precisely to quantify our social standing, and to see that other people have more friends and followers than we do. As Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett has brilliantly documented, girls and young women routinely alter the photos they post to make themselves look smoother and slimmer. Some phones, using their â€œbeautyâ€ settings, do it for you without asking now you can become your own thinspiration. Welcome to the   dystopia: a war of everyone against themselves. Is it any wonder, in these lonely inner worlds, in which touching has been replaced by retouching, that young women are drowning in mental distress? A recent survey in England suggests that one in four women between 16 and 24 have harmed themselves, and one in eight now suffer from   stress disorder. Anxiety, depression, phobias or obsessive compulsive disorder affect 26% of women in this age group. This is what a public health crisis looks like. If social rupture is not treated as seriously as broken limbs, it is because we cannot see it. But neuroscientists can. A series of fascinating papers suggest that social pain and physical pain are processed by the same neural circuits. This might explain why, in many languages, it is hard to describe the impact of breaking social bonds without the words we use to denote physical pain and injury. In both humans and other social mammals, social contact reduces physical pain. This is why we hug our children when they hurt themselves: affection is a powerful analgesic. Opioids relieve both physical agony and the distress of separation. Perhaps this explains the link between social isolation and drug addiction. Experiments summarised in the journal Physiology  Behaviour last month suggest that, given a choice of physical pain or isolation, social mammals will choose the former. Capuchin monkeys starved of both food and contact for 22 hours will rejoin their companions before eating. Children who experience emotional neglect, according to some findings, suffer worse mental health consequences than children suffering both emotional neglect and physical abuse: hideous as it is, violence involves attention and contact.   is often used as an attempt to alleviate distress: another indication that physical pain is not as bad as emotional pain. As the prison system knows only too well, one of the most effective forms of torture is solitary confinement. It is not hard to see what the evolutionary reasons for social pain might be. Survival among social mammals is greatly enhanced when they are strongly bonded with the rest of the pack. It is the isolated and marginalised animals that are most likely to be picked off by predators, or to starve. Just as physical pain protects us from physical injury, emotional pain protects us from social injury. It drives us to reconnect. But many people find this almost impossible. Itâ€™s unsurprising that social isolation is strongly associated with depression, suicide, anxiety, insomnia, fear and the perception of threat. Itâ€™s more surprising to discover the range of physical illnesses it causes or exacerbates. Dementia, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, lowered resistance to viruses, even accidents are more common among chronically lonely people. Loneliness has a comparable impact on physical health to smoking 15 cigarettes a day: it appears to raise the risk of early death by 26%. This is partly because it enhances production of the stress hormone cortisol, which suppresses the immune system. Studies in both animals and humans suggest a reason for comfort eating: isolation reduces impulse control, leading to obesity. As those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder are the most likely to suffer from loneliness, might this provide one of the explanations for the strong link between low economic status and obesity? Anyone can see that something far more important than most of the issues we fret about has gone wrong. So why are we engaging in this     frenzy of environmental destruction and social dislocation, if all it produces is unbearable pain? Should this question not burn the lips of everyone in public life? There are some wonderful charities doing what they can to fight this tide, some of which I am going to be working with as part of my loneliness project. But for every person they reach, several others are swept past. This does not require a policy response. It requires something much bigger: the reappraisal of an entire worldview. Of all the fantasies human beings entertain, the idea that we can go it alone is the most absurd and perhaps the most dangerous.

Then you do. Everything is changed utterly. Or about to be, as soon as your new leader is chosen. The country you live in, the parliamentary democracy that ruled it, for good or bad, has been trumped by a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status. From our agriculture to our science and our universities, from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics, and who and what we are in the world  â€”   all is up for a curious, unequal renegotiation with our European neighbours. How did we get to this? What can you do? By now you are putting on your shoes and running through the sequence yet one more time. The Conservative party needed to settle an old dispute within its ranks. The quarrel once wrecked the sleep of John Major. The schism needed to be healed to shore up the position and sleep of David Cameron. Certain newspaper owners and a large minority of Tory backbenchers had to be appeased. The promise to let the people decide was in the Conservative manifesto, and the country had voted for a Conservative government. It was legal and proper to have a referendum. The campaign was conducted by and was an argument between Conservative politicians  â€”   at its simplest,   against  . The role of Ukip was merely to make everyone else seem reasonable. We watched and wondered, as Kremlinologists once did. The Jeremy Corbyn Labour party was shamefully, or shamelessly, absent until it was too late. The status of the 2015 parliamentary act that enabled the referendum was clear, but we didnâ€™t read it. Was it advisory, like some referendums are, or was it binding? The question didnâ€™t come up. We failed to ask it. No use declaring, as you may keep declaring after it didnâ€™t go your way, that all along it was merely advisory. You should have thought of that earlier. And what was the nationâ€™s democratically tendered advice to our lawmakers? That weâ€™re almost evenly split. One third wants to leave, fractionally less than a third wants to stay, and a third doesnâ€™t know or doesnâ€™t care. Seventeen million against 16 million. Each full of contempt for the other. And on this basis and unlike any other country in the world, we are about to redraft our constitution and much else besides. Youâ€™ll be at the coffee before you remember all over again the lies that needed to be told to gain the result. The Â£350m a week that would become available to the NHS that we could halt immigration from Europe and remain in the single market that Turkey was about to join that we could â€œtake back our countryâ€  â€”   as if any international treaty was not, in a   context, a diminution of sovereignty in exchange for a greater good. On your second cup you might check online for the Conservative party rules for selecting a new leader, as if knowing them might empower you somehow. Or you might take another look at the far simpler article 50 that sets out the means of our departure. Barely 400 words, remarkably easy to read, given that it was drawn up by lawyers. When weâ€™ve invoked the clause weâ€™re committed to leave within two years. Our partners donâ€™t want to negotiate with us until the article is invoked. If these were the rules of a card game only a mug would sit down to play. The banker takes all. How can parliament, even assuming it has a say, vote on a deal it cannot see until itâ€™s too late? And yet we are told, even by the defeated Tory remainer faction, that â€œthe people have spokenâ€. Perhaps this is what the party wanted all along  â€”   all of it. We hardly know. The minority of us who read newspapers know less than a tenth of whatâ€™s happening. But we can be sure of the contempt each Tory caucus holds for the others, with some contempt to spare for us bystanders. We may assume that powerful Conservative figures wanted Boris Johnson gone, for historical as well as proximal reasons. Someone lofty may have spoken smoothly into the ear of his lieutenant, Michael Gove, to persuade him he was prime minister material and that he should desert. When he did and Johnson stepped aside, a   grandee, Michael Heseltine, was on hand to disembowel the corpse. Then, for his 15 minutes, Gove was before us,   like foolish Malvolio, until another grandee, Kenneth Clarke, in concert with the Daily Mail, was ready to knife his guts. Two down in the summer of contempt. Or it happened another way. We Kremlinologists can only guess at whatâ€™s being turned over in the clubs of St James or the farmhouses of Oxfordshire. But we do know that what all sides are calling the greatest political crisis of our generation is a creature imagined into being by the Conservative party alone. It, not Ukip, offered the referendum it fought it, it won as well as lost it. For such services, for the mayhem and poison that followed and are clouding the leadership contest, we should now be watching it shredded by an effective, eloquent opposition. But by their silence Corbyn and his troubled, paranoid court have delivered us, in effect, and for the time being, into a   state, and not the Leninist version certain courtiers dream of. Now you watch on helplessly as your prime minister is chosen. It is, of course, constitutionally correct that you have no say in the matter. But itâ€™s hard to shake off that   feeling. We can do no more than gossip round the kitchen table. The butler has a theory, and so does the second chambermaid. Even â€œbootsâ€ knows all about tactical voting. Our   paradoxically measures our distance from events. Is Boris biding his time, or is he truly finished? What does it tell us about the party, post 2008, that Andrea, an   hostile to the minimum wage, could soon be prime minister? Was Theresaâ€™s reticence during the referendum campaign astute and tactical? Or merely an expression of her character? Or is she the remainersâ€™ mole? Can we believe that the chancellor isnâ€™t plotting? We hear footsteps above our head  â€”   more comings and goings. But who? You might cling to the butlerâ€™s mole theory even as you worry that your hopes are loosening your grip on reality: the powerful faction that wanted to remain, and whispered flattery and enticements in Goveâ€™s ear, has cleared the field of Johnson, the other sideâ€™s most powerful contender, and eased one of its own into place as PM. The exit negotiations begin and are inevitably protracted in a game with such stacked odds. Our European friends, watching their own backs, will not be offering kindly terms. Only a fool would want to invoke the dread article too soon. Meanwhile, the economy is in decline, the pound is drifting towards parity with the dollar, the jobless lines are lengthening. Racists and xenophobes are gripped by an elated sense of entitlement. The cry gets louder for a second referendum. The voices come from the only quarter that matters  â€”   the party.   general Dominic Grieve is among the first, then some   then those grandees again. At last, with no loss of face, Prime Minister May reluctantly grants their wish. Itâ€™s what, in her heart, she always wanted. And clearly, the public mood has shifted. On   council estates leavers are suffering what weâ€™ve learned to call buyersâ€™ remorse. Second time around, remain sweeps the board. Weâ€™re back in. In fact, we never left. It was all a bad dream. The summer of contempt will be soon forgotten. Take your shoes off. Go back to bed. When you wake, Boris Johnson will be leader of the Labour party. He was, he says, always well to the left of Tony Blair. What can you do?",548,893,,fake

That evening in Los Angeles, his songwriting peer and friend Leonard Cohen gave his thoughts on Dylanâ€™s award. â€œTo me,â€ he said, â€œ[the award] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain. â€ Cohen was speaking at a playback and QA for his forthcoming album, You Want It Darker. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, to the consternation of fans the    had announced: â€œI am ready to die. â€ However, on Thursday evening seemed to have reconsidered his stance.  â€œI think I was exaggerating,â€ Cohen told the audience, according to Billboard. â€œIâ€™ve always been into  . I intend to live forever. â€ At the end of the event, at which Cohen divulged his plans to release another pair of albums after You Want it Darker, the songwriter told the audience: â€œI hope we can do this again. I intend to stick around until 120. â€ Cohen returned to the subject of Dylan when talking about the way he writes songs. â€œI think that Bob Dylan knows this more than all of us: you donâ€™t write the songs anyhow,â€ he said. â€œSo if youâ€™re lucky, you can keep the vehicle healthy and responsive over the years. If youâ€™re lucky, your own intentions have very little to do with this. You can keep the body as   and receptive as possible, but whether youâ€™re actually going to be able to go for the long haul is really not your own choice. â€ His own songs come slowly, he says: â€œIt comes kind of by dribbles and drops. Some people are graced with a flow some people are graced with something less than a flow. Iâ€™m one of those. â€ He added: â€œThe fact that my songs take a long time to write is no guarantee of their excellence. â€ An ordained Zen Buddhist monk who nevertheless still cleaves to Judaism, Cohen has long explored religious themes in his work  â€”   as has Dylan. Nevertheless, Cohen told the audience: â€œIâ€™ve never thought of myself as a religious person. I donâ€™t have any spiritual strategy. I kind of limp along like so many of us do in these realms. Occasionally Iâ€™ve felt the grace of another presence in my life. But I canâ€™t develop any kind of spiritual structure on that. â€ Cohen added: â€œThis biblical landscape is very familiar to me, and itâ€™s natural that I use those landmarks as references. Once they were universal references, and everybody understood and knew them. Thatâ€™s no longer the case today, but it is still my landscape. I try to make those references. I try to make sure theyâ€™re not too obscure. But outside of that, I canâ€™t  â€”   I dare not  â€”   claim anything in the spiritual realm for my own. â€",507,267,"983496593902055424	983784278034087937	984012686055956481	984208495917633536	984247385235668992	984247915509055489	984250908497334272	984259994022428672	984260712460636160	984262486668046336	984272425067208704	984277131508244480	984295778574372864	984310339033550849	984348928052113408	984408788357844993	984440469877911552	984440833981272065	984441138638671872	984453804027412481	984456074353872896	984457632818827264	984466324968615938	984477784247586816	984494317803835399	984500283324682240	984505576808906753	984527034880856064	984547119464886278	984553239071698944	984563645928562688	984592972262948864	984775311165480962	984823073340702720	984926423054987264	985376550114807808	985888518496022529",fake

Paul Verhoevenâ€™s new film, Elle, is an outrageous black comedy, volatile and deadly a film that opens up with a sexual assault and then cleans off the blood ahead of a posh restaurant dinner. â€œI suppose I was raped,â€ Michelle (Isabelle Huppert) casually remarks to her friends, just as the waiter swoops in with a magnum of champagne. A guest at the table flicks a nervous glance at the bottle. He says, â€œMaybe wait a few minutes before popping that. â€ Likewise one perhaps needs to pause before trumpeting Elle as one of the best pictures in this yearâ€™s Cannes competition, if only because its implications are so problematic they require more time to be processed. But thereâ€™s no denying that, in the moment at least, the film is utterly gripping and endlessly disturbing. In carving a hazardous path through hackneyed genre territory, Elle never flags, barely stumbles. Verhoeven, I fear, is pointing his film straight to Hell. He brazenly dares us to stick with him for the ride. Playing the role of Michele Leblanc, a moneyed Paris games executive, Huppert gives a performance of imperious fury, holding the audience at bay, almost goading us to disown her. Audaciously, Elle presents her not so much as a victim but as the casualty of a world she is very much a part of maybe (still more troublingly) an accessory to. Inside her sleek office, Michele strolls disinterestedly past a   model striking a brutalised pose. Her   game allows its user to take the role of a hulking orc rapist, penetrating a damsel from behind with a snaking tentacle. If that werenâ€™t enough, Michele is revealed to be the daughter of Charles Leblanc, a notorious 1970s serial killer, now safely behind bars. There is even a suggestion that she was somehow involved in his crimes. According to Michele, her father was â€œa monsterâ€ in the view of her mother (Judith Magre) he was â€œno more than a manâ€. The filmâ€™s implicit suggestion is that human beings can be both. Perish the thought that Verhoevenâ€™s a safe pair of hands. The director prides himself on discombobulating his audience maybe even discombobulating himself. In his time, the Dutch provocateur has conspired to seduce the Hollywood mainstream with Basic Instinct, flummox it with Starship Troopers and give it a ghastly cold shower with 1995â€™s Showgirls. Elle, however, may just be his most maniacal work to date, a film that runs boldly up and down the tonal bandwidth,   from   horror to devilish satire to light domestic comedy and then back again. For lengthy periods, in fact, Verhoevenâ€™s film appears to forget the rape altogether. Michele clears the broken crockery from the floor, sinks into a bath and then proceeds with her life. She has a demanding job to attend to family problems to address. She is enraged by her milksop son and his bullying pregnant girlfriend. She worries about her vampish mum, who has decided she wants to marry her gigolo. Sheâ€™s having an   affair with her colleagueâ€™s foursquare husband. But all the while the memory of the assault sits quietly in the room, like unstable nitroglycerin beside the  . Time and again, we catch its full horror in the corner of our eye. Michele, for her part, is drawn back to it too. What an electrifying film to close this yearâ€™s Cannes competition. If the delegates imagined they would be sent off with something gentle and affirming, they had another think coming. They sat down in the dark and received a slap in the face, a blatant provocation, a set of jump leads hooked on to their chests. Elle is uproarious, galvanic and guaranteed to spark debate. All at once it as though this yearâ€™s Cannes, a whisker away from the finish line, has just roared back into blazing, angry life.",751,273,"894412086339543040	894647687575986176",fake
politifact14330,http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/13/breaking-someone-else-plane-secret-bill-clintonloretta-lynch-meeting-2/,ни чего нового как правильно,"I landed in the United States as a child. My father was waiting for us. In a nod to the local western culture, he was wearing this strange thing on his head, a cowboy hat, and not recognizing him at first, I began to cry. My father was in Wyoming  â€”   truly the wild west  â€”   on a Fulbright fellowship, and my mother and I joined him several months into his tenure.  He loved cowboy culture: he had watched all the American westerns in Poland. We planned to return there once the fellowship ended. In fact, my parents were so sure of this that they had brought very little with them. Even prized possessions like family photographs and my grandmotherâ€™s handwritten recipe book were left behind.  We ended up staying much longer than expected. The political situation in Poland had changed for the worse in the early 1980s with the rise of nationwide strikes led by the Solidarity movement, a massive opposition movement. There was talk of Soviet intervention. My fatherâ€™s colleagues in Poland began to advise him against returning, as did some local folks in Wyoming.  Wyoming is a small place, and my father was soon introduced to its lone member in the US House of Representatives, a fellow by the name of Dick Cheney. Cheney, a staunch   met my father and encouraged him to defect and stay in the US. Donâ€™t worry, he said, Reagan will soon be president, and we will sort out all the immigration matters. Political asylum would be a slam dunk, he predicted.  We stayed.  The immigration matters, it turns out, were a bit harder to sort out than Cheney predicted. Visas for Fulbright fellowships come with strict requirements to return to oneâ€™s home country for at least two years. Cheney and other prominent people made a valiant effort, but the immigration bureaucracy pushed back.  After several years of being out of status (we had UN refugee passports) we were granted political asylum  â€”   which we received, coincidentally, the same year as Reaganâ€™s 1986 general amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Amnesty: a word that has become politically toxic today among the Republican set, even as a Republican legend was the first to implement it  â€”   helped us to gain legal status once and for all, six years after we decided to stay.  We lived for several years in   Wyoming before moving on to the excitement of California. As one of the few immigrant families in   Wyoming we stuck out like a sore thumb. But everyone wanted to help. A stranger paid our rent. In California, we were among oceans of immigrants just like us, but we were often alone.  When generalized, the immigrant story is clichÃ©. But to each individual immigrant, his or her story is extraordinary. A character in one of Jhumpa Lahiriâ€™s stories, an immigrant to the United States, expresses this best when he observes that he is not the â€œonly man to seek his fortune far from homeâ€ but nevertheless is â€œbewildered by each mileâ€ he has traveled. â€œAs ordinary as it all appears,â€ he says, â€œthere are times when it is beyond my imagination. â€  My father enjoyed a successful career as a chemist in California, and this year was the recipient of a major award from the American Chemical Society for his work. We all attended the award banquet, where many of the honorees were immigrants or former refugees.  Anyone who witnessed this event would be living in a total vacuum if they did not notice the sad irony of the heated     and   rhetoric in our current political campaign juxtaposed with the lasting contributions that a refugee from communist Poland, a Muslim immigrant from Egypt and countless others have made to the United States through chemistry alone.  Just a year ago I would have thought this a clichÃ© not worth repeating, but these days maybe itâ€™s important to repeat often. My brother is a successful manager in a   company. And both my younger sister and I went on to serve the United States as diplomats, and American Fulbright fellows overseas. In a twist of fate, as a US diplomat, I had to deal with cases of Fulbright scholars who wanted an exception to the â€œ â€ rule.  All of this may seem ordinary  â€”   but itâ€™s not, and in many ways it is uniquely possible in the United States.

Official 'Accidentally' Crushes Own Throat Right Before Testifying Against Hillary Clinton,"On July 21, the Department of Justice filed suit to block two mega health insurance mergers: Aetnaâ€™s purchase of Humana and Anthemâ€™s purchase of Cigna. These mergers would have consolidated the five national insurers to only three, shaking up the healthcare landscape. At this critical moment for the healthcare system and antitrust policy, regulators made the right call  â€”   and their skepticism should apply to all healthcare mergers. A large body of research finds that consolidation of insurers tends to increase premiums, while competition tends to lower premiums. For instance, in areas where Aetna currently competes with Humana, Aetnaâ€™s premiums are up to $300 lower than in areas where the two companies do not compete. Their merger would not only eliminate this current competition, but also foreclose any future competition between them in other areas and markets. But the healthcare merger frenzy is not just about insurance companies. Indeed, one reason insurers feel the need to merge is to increase their leverage against large hospital systems. Since the   more than 1, 200 hospital mergers have resulted in large hospital systems, which wield their market power to extract excessive prices from insurers. According to a recent analysis of billing data, these prices are the main driver of healthcare costs in commercial markets. Economists estimate that monopoly hospitals charge prices that are 15% higher than prices in more competitive hospital markets. The solution to this problem is not to allow insurers to merge to counteract the market power of hospitals. This tit for tat would fuel an arms race in which corporations would profit at the expense of consumers. Rather, the solution is to enforce a strong presumption against mergers on both sides of the market, starting now. Of course, drug corporations are also in on the game  â€”   accounting for about half of healthcare mergers. Thankfully, the Obama administration recently took action that effectively blocked a proposed merger between Pfizer and Allergan, which would have been the largest healthcare merger ever. But 2015 was still a   year for mergers in the drug industry. These mergers across healthcare sectors tend to drive up healthcare prices and costs for consumers and businesses. But they also have another pernicious effect  â€”   they contribute to rising income inequality. Consider the deal between Aetna and Humana. The CEO of Aetna stands to gain $131m from the merger. Whatâ€™s more, the transaction costs fuel an industry of Wall Street banks and corporate law firms, which have received more than $400m from the four merging insurers. To top it all off, the insurance companies can deduct these expenses from their taxes. More generally, economists are coming around to the view that income inequality among companies explains much of the income inequality among workers. Some companies are increasingly able to enjoy   returns  â€”   a trend that is associated with increasing market consolidation. According to McKinsey,   of   firms with a return of 45% or more from 2010 to 2014 are in the healthcare or information technology sectors. To lower healthcare costs  â€”   and help address income inequality  â€”   policymakers and regulators can take a number of steps. Regulators should review the results of previous mergers on a regular basis. Regulators often approve mergers but require a company to sell its business in certain markets to a competitor. But these remedies, designed to preserve competition, have not worked well in the past. For instance, as a condition of approval of a merger between Humana and Arcadian in 2012, the insurers had to sell 15 plans in certain markets to competitors. Subsequently, premiums increased for nine of these plans by an average of 44%  â€”   that is, until almost all of them exited the market. There should be greater accountability and transparency. Regulators should have public hearings and issue public findings and justifications. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office should appoint an independent Health Consumer Advocate. Companies frequently meet with regulators behind closed doors and inundate them with biased economic studies, but consumers do not have formal input into the process or opportunity to challenge their data. The advocate would monitor trends in prices, quality and utilization in healthcare markets. One purpose would be to shine a spotlight on outliers and identify drivers of cost growth. The advocate would also weigh in with regulators on proposed mergers and could dissent from their decisions. Public programs  â€”   as well as insurers that participate in these programs  â€”   would be required to provide the data necessary to carry out these duties. Above all else, regulators must set a very high bar for mergers. With its decision on the mega health insurance mergers, the Department of Justice has done just that.",78,782,8.85E+17,fake

Michelle Obama’s Mom Will Receive $160k Every Year Out Of Taxpayers’ Pockets!,"Donald Trump would be the only national leader in the world to dismiss the science of climate change should he become president, putting him out of step even with Syrian president Bashar   Zimbabweâ€™s Robert Mugabe and Kim   the leader of North Korea. The potential isolation of the US on climate change has been laid bare by a new Sierra Club report which found universal acceptance of climate science among the leaders of the 195 countries recognized by the US state department. Close US allies such as Britain, Israel, Canada and France all have heads of government who have voiced their understanding that the world is warming primarily due to human activities.  Even totalitarian or undemocratic leaders accept mainstream climate science, with Assad calling for nations to â€œrespond more effectivelyâ€ to the issue and Kim supporting a   initiative to mitigate greenhouse gases. The Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, has labelled climate change a â€œmajor global challengeâ€. By contrast, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called global warming â€œbullshitâ€ and a â€œhoaxâ€ that was â€œcreated by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitiveâ€. Trump has vowed to remove the US from the Paris climate accord, which was agreed by 195 countries last year in an attempt to curb   carbon dioxide emissions. He has also threatened to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency, which has come under sustained fire from Republicans over its role in Barack Obamaâ€™s   Clean Power Plan.  The Sierra Club report states that it is â€œessential that voters know that Donald Trumpâ€™s position on climate change is just another of his reckless, dangerous positions based more in reality TV than actual realityâ€. The environmental group said Trumpâ€™s stance would leave the US isolated on the world stage and undermine key alliances.  Trumpâ€™s pronouncements on climate change are also contrary to a large proportion of US voters, with recent Gallup polling showing a record number of Americans now see climate change as a threat to their way of life.  Separate research released on Tuesday by Yale University found that 45% of Americans are either â€œalarmedâ€ or â€œconcernedâ€ about climate change, with levels of worry reaching levels not seen since 2008. Trump appears to be speaking for a small but notable minority, with Yale finding that 10% of Americans are â€œdismissiveâ€ of climate change as an issue. Hillary Clinton is likely to assail Trumpâ€™s position on climate change during the presidential campaign, with the expected Democratic nominee handed a new party platform that calls for a carbon price and hefty support for solar and wind energy. In his endorsement of Clinton on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders said the former secretary of state understood the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Sanders said that Trump, on the other hand, â€œchooses to reject science  â€”   something no presidential candidate should do.  â€œHe believes that climate change is a hoax. In fact, he wants to expand the use of fossil fuel. That would be a disaster for our country and our planet. â€",772,442,"812119854337519618	812135042692632580	812136923888091136	812145938034786304	812243245191274498	812247452086661121	812279067030552576	812284980005048320	812303483785330688	812380323271114752	812391412813664257	812403787021385728	812436793496862720	812451815568482304	812470833603973120	812489418116370433	812499079540445185	812510424763662336	812621323797221376	812625752197775360	812668473667190786	812695881652862976	812717042776342528	812749178736476160	812814063763918848	812892885959880704	812896429777756160	812909005144293376	812930811397697536	812981918480429056	813015596690534400	813051493947478017	813052927409459200	813052944295686144	813052943448424448	813052947743395840	813058199452430336	813064384281018368	813065050793635840	813092616476704768	813163072529563648	813192381583466496	813230740343312384	813572501942992896	813854477392482308	816416753215475714",fake

Nearly 15% of the Earthâ€™s land, covering around 20m sq km, is contained in national parks or other protected areas. This figure has flatlined over the past year, largely because of improved data collection, but is close to an internationally agreed goal to protect 17% of the land surface by 2020. There has been a faster rate of progress in ocean conservation, albeit of a low base. Around 4% of the total surface of the ocean, covering 15m sq km, is now protected. This area, roughly the size of Russia, has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But the progress report by the UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warns that some of the most biodiverse ecosystems are not being protected and that the management of many protected areas is deficient.  Less than 20% of areas considered crucial hubs for species are fully protected, the report states, with countries routinely failing to assess the effectiveness of their national parks nor provide wildlife corridors that allow animals to roam between protected areas. Restricting hunting, mining and other development helps speciesâ€™ overall survival chances, with the report stating that global populations of terrestrial species in protected areas suffered an average decline of 18% from 1970 to 2010, compared to a 39% loss for species when unprotected areas are included. â€œEcological factors such as park size, fragmentation and connectivity are fundamentally important in the long term, but are often superseded by   social and economic factors,â€ the report, presented at the IUCN congress in Hawaii, found. â€œProtected areas can have positive impacts on species extinction risk and population trends, but they need to be properly sited and managed to realize their full potential. â€  Erik Solheim, head of UN environment, said that â€œhuge gainsâ€ have been made in the quantity of protected areas, but this had to be matched by their quality.  â€œThe world needs to do more to effectively protect our most biologically diverse spaces,â€ he said. â€œProtected areas need to be better connected, to allow populations of animals and plants to mix and spread. Also important is ensuring local communities are involved in protection efforts. Their support is fundamental to   conservation. â€  Countries in South America and the Caribbean protect the largest portion of their land, with Brazil accounting for the worldâ€™s largest safeguarded system, spanning 2. 47m sq km. Countries in the Middle East, by contrast, protect just 119, 000 sq km, or around 3% of the areaâ€™s landmass.  Some nations are moving towards including biodiversity values in their national accounts, such as the UK, which has accounted for the value of air quality and recreation in areas such as the Lake District. But other nations continue to subsidize ecologically harmful practices, such as Thailandâ€™s support for a shrimp farming industry that is resulting in the destruction of mangroves.  Marine reserves have grown thanks to new measures taken by countries including Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Spain. The report does not include the recent creation of the worldâ€™s largest ocean reserve by the US, off the   islands of Hawaii.  Conservationists are pushing for far greater efforts to protect marine life, with a resolution put to the IUCN congress that nations aim for 30% of the oceans to be protected. While terrestrial ecosystems are affected by climate change, poaching and mass land conversion for agriculture, the warming, acidifying oceans are possibly faring even worse with less protected area.   Dan Laffoley, a marine adviser for the IUCN, said the 30% target is â€œimportant, absolutely critical, but we need to think beyond those targets.

politifact15292,https://web.archive.org/web/20180424000839/http://redstatewave.com/article.asp?id=124965,BREAKING: Laura Ingraham Just Fired!!,"House Republicans investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, have found no new evidence to conclude that Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, was culpable in the deaths of four Americans, according to the committeeâ€™s final report released on Tuesday. The   document released by the Republicans on the House select committee on Benghazi brought to a close a fiercely partisan,   $7m investigation that included interviews with more than 80 witnesses. The report reveals new details about the night of the attack and concludes that the Obama administration failed to recognize the possibility of it happening. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, his state department colleague Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed when Islamist militants stormed the US consulate in Benghazi on 11 September 2012. Controversy has raged ever since over the chain of events and how much support the men had from Washington. The White House noted tersely that this was the eighth congressional committee to investigate the attacks and went on longer than the   commission and the committees designated to look at Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President John F Kennedy, the   affair and Watergate. It accused Republicans of pursuing â€œwild conspiracy theoriesâ€. Committee chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina, denied that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Clinton was the target. â€œWhen the select committee was formed, I promised to conduct this investigation in a manner worthy of the American peopleâ€™s respect, and worthy of the memory of those who died,â€ he said. â€œThat is exactly what my colleagues and I have done. Now, I simply ask the American people to read this report for themselves, look at the evidence we have collected, and reach their own conclusions. â€ But a split emerged among Republicans on the committee. Two members, Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, issued a   supplementary report more forthright in its criticism. It says: â€œWhat we did find was a tragic failure of leadership  â€”   in the   to the attack and the night of  â€”   and an administration that, so blinded by politics and its desire to win an election, disregarded a basic duty of government: tell the people the truth. And for those reasons Benghazi is, and always will be, an American tragedy. â€ Jordan, from Ohio, and Pompeo, from Kansas, were equally blunt in their condemnation of Clinton in particular. â€œSecretary Clinton and the administration told one story privately  â€”   that Benghazi was a terrorist attack  â€”   and told another story publicly  â€”   blaming a   protest,â€ they wrote. Pressed on whether he believed that Clinton lied, Gowdy declined to give a direct answer, telling journalists to read the report. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to decide that for yourself,â€ he said. The committeeâ€™s Democrats, who have long derided the investigation as politically motivated, on Monday released their own report on the committeeâ€™s findings. â€œAlthough the select committee obtained additional details that provide context and granularity, these details do not fundamentally alter the previous conclusions,â€ the Democratsâ€™ report said. Donald Trump has used the incident to discredit Clintonâ€™s time at the helm of the state department. In a speech last week, he said Clinton â€œspread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims was our late ambassador Chris Stevensâ€. And on Tuesday Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, weighed in: â€œThe new information in the majorityâ€™s report on the Benghazi terrorist attack makes clear that Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration engaged in a politically motivated   weeks before the 2012 presidential election. â€œHillary Clinton knew the night of the attack it had nothing to do with an internet video, and yet she shamefully peddled this false narrative to the American public and to the victimsâ€™ families. This in itself is a disqualifying act of deception. â€ Clinton, campaigning in Denver, said: â€œI understand that after more than two years and $7m spent by the Benghazi committee under taxpayer funds, it had to today report that it had found nothing  â€”   nothing  â€”   to contradict the conclusions that the independent accountability board, or the conclusions of the prior multiple earlier investigations carried out on a bipartisan basis in the Congress. â€ She added: â€œSo while this unfortunately took on a partisan tinge, I want us to stay focused on what Iâ€™ve always wanted us to stay focused on, and that is the important work of diplomacy and development. â€ The Democratic nominee added: â€œThatâ€™s especially true in dangerous places. We cannot withdraw or retreat from the world. America needs a presence for a lot of reasons, and the best way to honor the commitment and sacrifice of those weâ€™ve lost is to redouble our efforts to provide resources and support that our diplomats and development groups deserve. So, Iâ€™ll leave it to others to characterize this report, but I think itâ€™s pretty clear that itâ€™s time to move on. â€ In Washington, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, condemned the report claiming it dealt in â€œpolitically motivated fantasiesâ€ and accused Republicans of â€œcynically trying to capitalise on the deaths of four innocent Americans who were killed overseasâ€.  Asked if he believed this finally drew a line under the Benghazi issue, Earnest replied: â€œI thought it was over after the first five investigations. This was the eighth. â€ He called on the Republican National Committee to correctly report the   contributions for the $7m investigation in its next filing with the Federal Election Commission. In October, Clinton endured 11 hours of questioning by the House select committee, and was roundly commended for her performance during the marathon hearing while the chairman was criticized for failing to produce any new information about the 2012 attack. The hearing was a turning point for Clintonâ€™s campaign. On the trail, Democrats still refer to her    performance as a testament to her endurance and ability to withstand and overcome partisan attacks. The report faults the military for its slow response sending resources to the Libyan city during the deadly 2012 attacks on a US outpost, despite clear orders from Barack Obama and the then US defense secretary Leon Panetta. Gowdy said â€œnothing was en route to Libya at the time the last two Americans were killed almost eight hours after the attacks beganâ€. He said the Libyan forces that evacuated Americans from the CIA annex in Benghazi were not affiliated with any of the militias the CIA or state department had developed a relationship with during the previous 18 months. Gowdy said on Tuesday that the report documents that the US was slow to send help to the Americans in Benghazi â€œbecause of an obsession with hurting the Libyansâ€™ feelingsâ€. He said the report was not aimed at Clinton, but portrays â€œseries of heroic actsâ€ by Americans under attack â€œand what we can do to preventâ€ other assaults. The Democratsâ€™ report released on Monday saying that while the state departmentâ€™s security measures in Benghazi the night of 11 September 2012 were â€œwoefully inadequateâ€ Clinton never personally turned down a request for additional security. Democrats said the military could not have done anything differently that night to save the lives of the Americans. On Tuesday, the panelâ€™s Democrats denounced the Republicansâ€™ report as â€œa conspiracy theory on steroids  â€”   bringing back   allegations with no credible evidence whatsoeverâ€.  The state department also issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that the â€œessential factsâ€ of the attacks â€œhave been known for some timeâ€ and have been the subject of numerous reviews, including one by an independent review board.

Eden Hazard rolled back the months with a display reminiscent of his role in Chelseaâ€™s title victory last season but it is his country, not his club, that stands to benefit from his return to fitness and form. Chelseaâ€™s away support chanted for a new contract for John Terry and unveiled a banner showing the trophies won under his stewardship complete with a call to â€œsign him upâ€. Yet the performance of their mesmerising No10 showed there are other, younger assets that Stamford Bridge can   to lose this summer. Hazard capped a fine evening with an outstanding individual goal, only his fourth in the Premier League this season, and his recovery comes just in time for Belgiumâ€™s Euro 2016 campaign. But Guus Hiddinkâ€™s team paid the price for failing to kill the contest in the second half. â€œHe had a difficult year,â€ Hiddink, Chelseaâ€™s interim manager, said of the Belgian. â€œHe was one of the best last year and this year he was falling into injury, coming back nearly, falling back into injury and that made him vulnerable physically. You get frustrated. The last few weeks he has been working on a programme to be fully fit and now steadily he has got his shape and then you can see what he is able to do. He has a lot of talent, is clever and can play   . He is conceding a lot of physical contacts but he goes on and it is nice to see. He is physically and mentally fit and it is a pleasure to see those sort of players. â€ For JÃ¼rgen Klopp, there was an element of fortune in Liverpoolâ€™s unbeaten run at Anfield reaching game No13. A ninth Premier League defeat beckoned in the managerâ€™s 50th match in charge until the Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was deceived by Sheyi Ojoâ€™s cross and pushed the ball on to the head of the waiting Benteke. The combination of the two Liverpool substitutes for the equaliser reflected well on the teamâ€™s attitude and the managerâ€™s decision to go for broke, but Klopp will need much more from what appeared his Europa League final side when it reconvenes against Sevilla next week. Klopp said: â€œFor the first 15 minutes we played wonderful football without scoring and I said after the game it was the most important game of the season. We showed in the first 15 minutes what we were capable of. There was not enough faith in our own quality and so we lost patience and when you lose patience it is always difficult and we lost formation. â€œWe didnâ€™t defend together but we invested a lot and that made us tired. That was the problem of the game. Maybe they could have scored the second one but Simon Mignolet did brilliantly and Kolo [TourÃ©] and Dejan [Lovren] saved our life at this moment. We had two or three really good moments and we used one to get a draw. The last 10 minutes it was not too lucky but we could have lost today. â€ Hazard opened the scoring with a quite exquisite goal. There was minimal threat to the home defence when the playmaker collected possession deep in the Liverpool half and even after exchanging passes with Cesc FÃ bregas. But then he accelerated past four weak challenges with a deft touch and a drop of the shoulder and, from the edge of the penalty area, swept an outstanding finish into the far corner of Mignoletâ€™s goal. It served as a reminder of the form and talent that brought Hazard player of the year awards last season and has been sorely missed at Stamford Bridge for the majority of this campaign. Bertrand TraorÃ©, the youngster Tammy Abraham and Hazard all had chances to secure the away win but, with Mignolet saving well and opportunities wasted, Liverpool always had hope of a reprieve. Benteke provided it with a   header before Klopp led his squad on a lap of anticipation. It is now all about Sevilla.",382,379,"878353204584513536	878362662098186240	878398291926548481	878414771090894848	878421254448979968	878635835834343424	878644965794082816	878692924740915200	878744569172566017	878759384360341505	881967124075380741	883829695040696320",fake

The Benicia, California, man had stayed up all night waiting for the sheriffâ€™s office to evict him from the house his grandparents had owned since 1971. â€œIt was really, really traumatic,â€   recalled one year later. Standing outside the locked front door, the    peered into the empty living room that holds his earliest Christmas memories and surveyed the overgrown ivy damaging the houseâ€™s facade. The foreclosure  â€”   which he said was based on a predatory loan and improper paperwork  â€”   originated with lender OneWest Bank, at the time run by chairman and CEO Steven Mnuchin. The veteran Wall Street financierâ€™s foreclosure practices are receiving fresh scrutiny this week after   Donald Trump announced him as the nominee for US Treasury secretary. â€œRather than shaking up Wall Street, he installs the very person that was part of the financial mess,â€ said   who has effectively been homeless since the foreclosure. â€œIâ€™m just thoroughly disgusted. â€ Mnuchin, who is also a Hollywood movie producer, earned the nickname â€œforeclosure kingâ€ after he purchased distressed mortgages during the financial crisis and evicted thousands of homeowners. The former Goldman Sachs banker, worth an estimated $40m, has no government experience, and critics worry that, as Treasury secretary, his policies could benefit the wealthiest people and roll back critical bank regulations. One controversial source of OneWest foreclosures is the corporationâ€™s reverse mortgages, which are loans to elderly homeowners that enable them to borrow against their home equity. These types of mortgages have been aggressively marketed to seniors as a way to help them stay in their homes, but some donâ€™t understand the risks and canâ€™t afford associated fees. In 2006,  â€™s grandparents bought a reverse mortgage from IndyMac Bank, the predecessor to OneWest, which he said took advantage of his grandfather, who suffered from dementia.  After his grandparents died in 2012,   moved in, but the corporation  â€”   by then OneWest and run by Mnuchin  â€”   quickly began foreclosure proceedings.  The bankâ€™s case, he said, relied on a document signed with the name â€œBryan Blyâ€ who has been widely reported in numerous investigations as a   â€œ â€.   are individuals whose signatures are wrongfully used to automatically authenticate thousands of mortgage documents that they havenâ€™t read and are in some cases falsely notarized.  The document, which an auditor determined was improper, makes his foreclosure illegitimate,   said, adding: â€œItâ€™s elder financial abuse. â€ His family is still fighting the foreclosure, but in the meantime  â€™s mother has been forced to live in a nursing home. The California Reinvestment Coalition, a   that has scrutinized OneWest, found through public records requests that the bank disproportionately foreclosed on seniors. The firm was allegedly responsible for 39% of reverse mortgages in recent years even though it only has 17% of the market.  From 2009 to 2015, the bank was responsible for more than 36, 000 total foreclosures in California, according to the coalition.  Julie Cheney, a California resident whose parents lost their home to a OneWest foreclosure stemming from a reverse mortgage, testified against OneWest before it merged with a company called CIT Group last year. (Mnuchin earned millions from the sale).  â€œItâ€™s so wrong,â€ Cheney said, explaining that the bank sold her parents a mortgage they didnâ€™t need while her father was dying of cancer and on pain medication and her mother was suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s disease.  Her familyâ€™s unsuccessful court battle against OneWest was a huge strain on her mother right before she died, Cheney added. â€œIt was the worst time of my life. â€  Maeve Elise Brown, executive director of Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, said some of the cruelest OneWest evictions she has observed involve foreclosures against recently widowed homeowners. â€œItâ€™s unimaginable. People are still traumatized from the death of their loved one,â€ she said, â€œand then they are faced with the second largest loss, which is the roof over their head. â€  CIT Group and Trumpâ€™s transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Foreclosures arenâ€™t the only way OneWest has inflicted harm on vulnerable people, according to critics.  In November, two   filed a complaint against the bank, alleging that it has violated the Fair Housing Act by failing to locate branches in communities of color and providing disproportionately low rates of loans to Asian Americans, African Americans and Latinos in California.  In   neighborhoods, OneWest was far more likely to foreclose on homes than make loans available, according to the charges, which claim that in 2014 and 2015, the corporation offered only two loans to black borrowers.  The complaint, which calls for an investigation by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, further accuses the corporation of allowing foreclosed properties to become blighted and abandoned in communities of color, while properly maintaining and marketing homes in white neighborhoods.  â€œThere is a very high price to pay in terms of the health and safety of the neighborhood,â€ said Caroline Peattie, executive director of the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California, which filed the complaint alongside the reinvestment coalition.  In white neighborhoods, OneWest properties generally had â€œmanicured lawns, securely locked doors and windows, and attractive, professional, â€˜for saleâ€™ signs posted out frontâ€ according to the complaint. In communities of color, the foreclosed houses â€œwere more likely to have trash strewn about the premises, overgrown grass, shrubbery, and weeds, and boarded or broken doors and windowsâ€. Blighted properties can attract garbage, crime and public safety hazards, she said, adding that studies have found that living near foreclosures is linked to higher blood pressure.  â€œItâ€™s as if a lender has turned the personâ€™s home into a piece of trash,â€ said Brown. â€œAny lender who does not maintain the property is victimizing the entire neighborhood. â€",951,840,"829116681150615552	829116680206950401	829117362280423424	829117383671377920	829210461103091713	829295055714279429	829319154838671360	829319740103471105	829319743173705728	829319742569738241	829319742364217345	829319745824550912	829319754238324737	829320082560077825	829320106459136002	829320135114637314	829320138247852036	829397466554519562	829445609060851712	829537653888520193	829539180833284097	829808658125090819	829844988641026048	829858409742675968	831597122642386944	832829333731434496	832969603068235776	834214965305233409	835564421061595136	835569058078683137	835569217059622912	835575713071792128	835575781162115072	835575885700943872	835578558756110337	835579232801562624	835580516023824384	835584929199185925	835588228170145792	835590442775273472	835590631133220865	835591607260831745	835593022129700864	835593593364557827	835594347299110912	835594400914882560	835594738313089024	835876594560319488	835876975625515008",fake
politifact14950,https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/about/faqs.html,Frequently Asked Questions,"Last Friday was a big day for voting rights in the United States. Federal courts struck down restrictive voting laws in Kansas and Wisconsin. And in a particularly important decision, the fourth circuit court of appeals delivered a stinging rebuke to North Carolinaâ€™s egregious vote suppression law. As the court observed, North Carolina legislators didnâ€™t even try to hide the core purpose of the law: to stop African Americans from getting to the polls. The politics of North Carolina are a perfect illustration of what led the Republican party to nominate Trump. The southern state, which has seen a large influx of people into its prosperous urban centers, is becoming more liberal  â€”   Barack Obama carried the state in 2008, and Mitt Romney carried it by only two points in 2012. North Carolina Republicans have not reacted to these trends, however, by becoming more moderate.  The clash between a Republican party running at full speed to the right while its population was trending to the left led North Carolina to pass a particularly terrible   law. In 2013, a bare majority of the US supreme court gave the green light to North Carolina by striking down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states, such as North Carolina, that had a history of discrimination to preclear electoral law changes with the Department of Justice. In addition to a requirement that voters show particular forms of ID, the state eliminated Sunday voting, narrowed the window for early voting and eliminated   vote registration and early registration for   and   olds. Voter ID requirements at least have the superficial appearance of addressing the integrity of elections, although in practice the justification is bogus. But most of the provisions in North Carolinaâ€™s attack on the right to vote had no purpose, even in theory, other than to make it harder for people to vote. Or, to put it more accurately, make it harder for some people to vote. In a careful, detailed, and absolutely devastating opinion for a unanimous   panel, Judge Diana Motz demonstrated that the law â€œtarget[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precisionâ€. The discriminatory intent that could be clearly inferred from the nature of the statute itself was not well hidden.  As Motz pointed out: â€œ[B]efore enacting that law, the legislature requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans. â€ When you request data about how changes in vote laws will affect the African American vote, and then change laws in ways deliberately designed to suppress it, thereâ€™s really no room left for doubt.  The story in Wisconsin is similar, although its legislature was a little better at hiding its tracks. Republicans in the state have used lower   turnouts to win elections and pursue a very aggressive conservative agenda in a state that perennially votes Democratic in presidential elections. It passed vote restrictions that disproportionately affect people of color and the poor, and these restrictions were also struck down on Friday. Both of these decisions materially affect the elections in November. Not only will Trump be targeting North Carolina and Wisconsin both states have Senate elections, with control of the chamber responsible for confirming (or not confirming) supreme court nominees looking to come down to the wire. The nakedness of these vote suppression tactics is so obvious that earlier in July, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals struck down similar legislation in Texas. While the supreme court made it harder to challenge these tactics by gutting the voting rights law, there are still remedies available and federal courts have finally begun to push back against these attempts to suppress the votes of people of color and the poor. These are important victories. But they also underscore the importance of getting a supreme court majority that will fight back against vote suppression rather than facilitating it. Whether this happens will be determined in November, not only in the contest between Clinton and Trump but in the contest to control the Senate. ",803,220,,fake

With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, the scientists observed Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. â€œIf plumes exist, this is an exciting find,â€ lead researcher William Sparks said. â€œIt means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals,â€ he added. â€œIt would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. â€ The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. â€œWe presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because thatâ€™s what Europaâ€™s made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed. â€ With other instruments, he said, the scientists could search for hydrogen, oxygen and other chemicals that could hint to what the ocean is made up of.

But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating  â€”   the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant. Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. â€œFor a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth,â€ Nasa astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. â€œWeâ€™re lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically. â€œWe have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics. Europa might be such a place. â€ The finding, Nasaâ€™s astrophysicist Paul Hertz said, â€œincreases our confidence that water and other materials in Europaâ€™s ocean, Europaâ€™s hidden ocean, might be . .. available for us to study without us landing and digging on those unknown miles of iceâ€. Scientists have collected clues for decades of an ocean beneath Europaâ€™s icy shell. In 1979, Voyager spacecraft showed that the ice was cracked in some places, like ice floes on Earth, and the 1990s Galileo mission, which spent eight years orbiting Jupiter, confirmed the ocean under Europa. A 2016 study suggested that Europa produces 10 times more oxygen than hydrogen, and a 2014 study suggested the moon may have plate tectonics, qualities that would make it like Earth. Nasa scientists have been working on proposals for a Europa mission for 15 years, and has a tentative plan to send a spacecraft on a flyby near the moon in the 2020s, zipping past its intense,   radiation field. The ESA has also planned a mission to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) which will aim to orbit the moon Ganymede and collect data and Europa and a third moon, Callisto. â€œThe Europa flyby is not a   mission,â€ said program scientist Curt Niebur. â€œThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa. â€  Niebur said that Nasa was well versed in evaluating habitability, but had little in its history evaluating for life. â€œWhen it comes to finding life we donâ€™t have as much experience, and we have an ongoing and vigorous debate in the scientific community when it goes to finding out. â€ Sparks and Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman similarly downplayed the chances that a flyby mission could find direct evidence of life. â€œBy the time it gets into space, with radiation and cryogenic temperature, itâ€™s not going to survive,â€ he said. â€œThe juryâ€™s out,â€ said Wiseman. â€œIt first depends on whether the plumes are really there. â€ Should the plumes exist, a spacecraft orbiting Europa could collect samples from plumes to get a taste of what Hertz called â€œa global saline liquid water oceanâ€ that â€œengulfs the moon at the present time, hidden under miles of iceâ€. Last year Nasaâ€™s Cassini spacecraft dove into the plumes erupting from Saturnâ€™s moon Enceladus, finding ice and dust that revealed qualities of the moonâ€™s ocean. â€œIt has revealed a tremendous amount of information about the ocean that is present beneath Enceladusâ€™ ice shell,â€ Hertz said. â€œWe would kill to have that kind of information and data about Europa. â€ Sparks said the observations announced today were actually made in 2014, only a year after Nasa researchers saw what they believed to be evidence of water vapor plumes shooting 120 miles into space from Europaâ€™s south pole. â€œItâ€™s not just taking a picture,â€ Sparks said. â€œItâ€™s a rather complicated way of observing. â€ He said that engineers had to develop the software to analyze a table of observed events, about 50 miles in total, and that the researchers continued to observe the moon throughout. Sparks said that they had found statistically significant results, but cautioned: â€œWe do not claim to have proven the existence of plumes but rather to have contributed evidence that such activity may be present. â€",439,645,"575068424176455680	575122869157519360	575192941444120576	575284219934601216	575284391934607360	575284520867524608	575289033120677888	575295116530745345	575304558894710786	575304579757252609	575427241561063425	575482466388983808	575514184919695360	575518416997580801	575548787017564160	575555348397953024	575580757680332800	575639709042372609	575642798612873217	575645026778218496	575649356973371392	575650596671225857	575651825308696577	575651981584429056	575659466454134784	575661230800650240	575671763721453569	575672568281067520	575674883876720640	575681044759756802	575687082183671808	575687441652301826	575688028363980800	575689646010667009	575693329834319872	575699022377324545	575699777452531713	575701662263726080	575701660476960768	575701670794895360	575701672950829056	575703478598823937	575725297548574720	575726013725868032	575748546118488064	575785270802436097	575806489283063808	575882749929766912	575896632878727168	575982996496465920	576000885366648833	576074281500733441	576238337129725953	576265939169185792	576274370051629056	576337133272743936	576371364254388224	576909855660883968	578540336605192192	684834534286868481	684838263396384768	684842392634167298	684865852651507712	684880369519300609	684955712477392896	684964835751247872	684979021021614080	684986320805097472	684986355659730944	684996709563412480	685011853685207040	685024516410576896	685031430540386304	685045608550428672	685077478038179840	685079550187954177	685081149287215105	685082206096756736	685095456398008320	685123252826587137	685149851470983169	685166787382632448	685196575870705665	685208226409889792	685211606981210112	685229269136617472	685342029346390016	685342957248098304	685363666833829888	685365031568052224	685386120696328192	685391841949265920	685403484724695040	685422204058755073	685426037690335232	685426492491313152	685455618472329216	685469282025746432	685511049643225088	685590671646834688	685708200683933696	685818721856831488	685863554239606784	686200047650914304	686218509286793216	686270756515409920	686426095026061312	686508376898056192	686569158792851456	686640378007674880	687342538806718464	687579430462615552	691872119454568448	692058453842530308	692292044375605252	698000964138221568	699380047229100032	699612607083376641	699631777191571456	699961337363836928	699975499615989761	733329053084700672	764275369096548352	764304810199937024	840885337245249536	840886161405022208	840890831590440960	840912400278790144	840943292212641796	840979945849528322	841023098593898496	841023649582858242	841024888810950664	841074767507660806	841106847901876227	841168024967270400	841186222114557952	841330273337933824	841349499599613953	841656479434301441	841907805560942593	842258581634334721",fake

Authorities named the woman killed and revealed that train engineer Thomas Grayling has answered investigatorsâ€™ questions and was cooperating, after being released from hospital following the crash at a major transportation hub in Hoboken during Thursday morningâ€™s rush hour. But the cause of the crash, and whether it could have been prevented by safety devices, remains unclear.  Rail investigators have pulled one of the trainâ€™s black box data recorders from the wreckage and on Friday were struggling to extract the second one intact from a   camera on the front of the train, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported. The two recorders are expected to contain information on speed, braking and other conditions that will help experts piece together the operation of the equipment and the actions of the engineer immediately before the New Jersey Transit commuter train crashed. Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, the woman who died in the crash, was not a passenger on the train but was killed by falling debris. She was a    mother of one daughter described as having a â€œbig and genuine heart, â€œI am speechless and feel like the world stopped for some moments,â€ Cecilia Marques, a former   at a company that specialized in travel to Brazil, told the Associated Press. â€œI had the privilege to get to know and work with Fabiola for some years, and I can say she was a great, talentedâ€ woman. De Kroon previously worked in the Brazilian legal department of SAP, a technology firm, the company said in a statement. She had just dropped her toddler daughter off at daycare before rushing to catch a train, according to daycare director Karlos Magner. â€œWe had a good talk for like a minute,â€ he said. â€œShe said she was in a rush. â€ A bystander, Rahman Perkins, tried to help De Kroon but could only comfort her as she lay trapped by metal debris that had fallen from the partially collapsed ceiling. â€œI just told her to fight for your breath, think about your family, think about your friends, think about tomorrow,â€ Perkins said. â€œI just wanted her to feel special and just donâ€™t think about the pain, donâ€™t think about whatever this chaos is, donâ€™t worry about it, youâ€™ll be fine. â€ Perkins said he tried to hug the woman as she died. â€œI saw that beauty in her. I saw that peace,â€ he said. â€œI want [de Kroonâ€™s family] to know she was that same person, she wasnâ€™t mangled, she wasnâ€™t all over the place, she was just there and unfortunately she didnâ€™t make it. â€ Engineer Gallagher, a   veteran of New Jersey Transit, was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon. Fifteen of the injured were still in the hospital, including two in intensive care. Meanwhile, early on Friday morning commuters faced a confusing and dark journey into New York City. Reporters on the scene captured images of a lightless and signless transit hub, where commuters had to navigate an unfamiliar station to reach a ferry to New York. Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York avoided commenting on Thursday on whether positive train control, a safety device widely used in Europe and ordered by the federal government, could have prevented the crash. The speed limit heading into the station is 10mph. â€œThe train came in at much too high rate of speed, and the question is: why is that?â€ Christie said. More answers were expected from a National Transportation Safety Board investigation, including from event recorders recovered from the accident,   Bella   said on Friday morning.. The implementation of positive train control has been delayed in New York and New Jersey, despite repeated deadly crashes in the area, including in the Bronx and in Valhalla, New York, on a Metro North train and near Philadelphia on an Amtrak train.  The crash has also put a renewed focus on New Jersey Transit, an organization some critics say has been â€œsystematically starvedâ€ by Christieâ€™s cuts and a lack of state transportation funds. Despite   recent exceptions, rail continues to be one of the safest ways for passengers to travel in the US. Each year, roughly seven passengers on mainline trains are killed, according to recent research. Cuomo and Christie both cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the role that the lack of positive train control played or did not play in the tragedy. The NTSB has been pressing for some version of the technology for at least 40 years and the industry is under government orders to install it, but regulators have repeatedly extended the deadline at railroadsâ€™ request. The target date is now the end of 2018. Over the past 20 years, the NTSB has listed the lack of positive train control as a contributing factor in 25 crashes. Those include an Amtrak crash last year in Philadelphia in which a speeding train ran off the rails along a curve. Eight people were killed. In 2011, a Port Authority   or Path commuter train crash in a separate section of the Hoboken station injured more than 30 people. The NTSB found the engineer failed to control the speed of the train as it entered the station and investigators also determined a contributing factor was the absence of positive train control. â€œTheyâ€™ll have to answer for themselves, but at the end of the day if safety is job one   â€¦     then you have to have a better record than New Jersey Transit has right now,â€ said New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, noting that the transit agency said in a 2016 Federal Railroad Administration report that it did not have positive train control on any locomotive or segment of track. â€œThat means zero across the board,â€ he said. â€œThey need to do better than zero across the board. â€",882,78,,fake

Icihiro broke Pete Roseâ€™s   record of 4, 256 after a double during the Miami Marlinsâ€™ game against the San Diego Padres, but Rose said he wasnâ€™t counting Ichiroâ€™s hits in Japan. The Miami Marlins outfielder has a career total of 4, 257 hits  â€”   2, 979 in MLB and 1, 278 in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. Rose, who won three World Series rings, told USA Today earlier this week: â€œIt sounds like in Japan theyâ€™re trying to make me the Hit Queen. Iâ€™m not trying to take anything away from Ichiro  â€”   heâ€™s had a Hall of Fame career  â€”   but the next thing you know, theyâ€™ll be counting his high school hits. â€œI donâ€™t think youâ€™re going to find anybody with credibility say that Japanese baseball is equivalent to   baseball. There are too many guys that fail here, and then become household names there, like Tuffy Rhodes. How can he not do anything here, and hit (a  ) 55 home runs (in 2001) over there? â€œIt has something to do with the caliber of personnel. â€ Ichiroâ€™s pursuit of the milestone is big news in Japan. NHK, Japanâ€™s national public broadcasting network, is broadcasting every game to chronicle one of the greatest achievements in Japanese sports history. But in the US, itâ€™s drawn little fanfare  â€”   something that doesnâ€™t sit well with some. â€œI cannot believe itâ€™s not a bigger deal in Major League Baseball. Shame on us for not making a bigger deal out of it,â€ Arizona Diamondbacks assistant hitting coach Mark Grace told USA Today. â€œYouâ€™re talking about breaking Pete Roseâ€™s record. I couldnâ€™t care less if he got some of those hits in Japan or in Antarctica. Youâ€™re getting hits at high professional levels. Thatâ€™s huge. Iâ€™m in awe of the guy. â€ Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who produced 2, 153 career hits, said: â€œItâ€™s hard to compare, but itâ€™s a lot of hits no matter how you slice it. Weâ€™ve had a number of Japanese players come over and be really successful. To say itâ€™s   and   numbers, thatâ€™s not quite fair. â€œThe fact is that heâ€™s going to have 3, 000 hits here, and to have all of those hits in Japan, too, tells you how special he is.

At the IOCâ€™s session before the Rio Olympic Games, the president intensified his attack on Wada, saying it was to blame for the chaos because it did not act sooner to investigate claims of Russian doping. Asked for a show of hands in support of the IOCâ€™s stance, 84 of the 85 members raised their hand. Only Britainâ€™s Adam Pengilly voted against Bachâ€™s position. More than 200 Russian athletes are in Rio in limbo having been put forward to compete by their federations but awaiting ratification by a   IOC panel at some point before the opening ceremony on Friday. Most of the sports put forward the majority of the Russian athletes who had been nominated, with only athletics, rowing, weightlifting and canoeing taking a more robust stance. on Wednesday the court of arbitration for sport threw out the appeal filed by 17 Russian rowers against their exclusion from the Games. The IOC has been roundly criticised for its confusing response to the McLaren report that was commissioned by Wada and which revealed systemic widespread doping in Russia across the majority of Olympic sports. Bach again blamed Wada for failing to act sooner on evidence of   doping in Russia and releasing its findings so close to the start of the Games. He said it would be wrong to make individual Russian athletes â€œcollateral damageâ€ for the wrongdoing of their government. â€œLeaving aside that such a comparison is completely out of any proportion when it comes to the rules of sport, let us just for a moment consider the consequences of a â€˜nuclear optionâ€™,â€ Bach said. â€œThe result is death and devastation. This is not what the Olympic movement stands for. The cynical â€˜collateral damageâ€™ approach is not what the Olympic movement stands for. What is therefore not acceptable is the insinuation by some proponents of this nuclear option, that anyone who does not share their opinion is not fighting against doping. â€ Bach has become increasingly emboldened in his stance since arriving in Rio, arguing in his opening press conference the IOCâ€™s reputation had not been damaged by the affair. Bach, whose links to Vladimir Putin have also come under scrutiny, went further in front of the IOC members as he renewed his attack on Wada. â€œIt is not the IOC that is responsible for the accreditation and supervision of   laboratories,â€ he said. â€œThe IOC has no authority over the testing programme of athletes outside the Olympic Games. The IOC has no authority to follow up on information about the failings of the testing system. â€ The IOC has convened a meeting later this year to discuss the future of   with the future of Wada  â€”     funded by the IOC and governments  â€”   in the balance. Many argue it would be a retrograde step to give the IOC more control over  . Sir Craig Reedie, who is an IOC   but also the president of Wada, admitted that the   system was partly broken but denied he had been â€œrun under a busâ€ by Bach and the IOC. â€œI would like to think not all the system is broken, that part of the system is broken, and we should start to identify those parts that need full attention,â€ he said. Earlier, the Argentinean IOC member Dr Gerardo Werthein had accused Wada of being â€œmore interested in   and publicityâ€. Reedie responded: â€œI told him that I found that personally offensive. He assured me that he wasnâ€™t speaking about me. â€ Reedie has repeatedly called in recent months for more money to fund   suggesting in an article for the Guardian that sponsors and rights holders should divert some of their cash into dramatically increasing its $27m a year budget, currently provided jointly by the IOC and national governments. â€œI have to find out the additional things people want me to do. I can tell you that we have a limited number of people employed around the world and every year, we are asked to do more and more and more with effectively the same level of funding,â€ said Reedie. â€œIâ€™ve been running the hare that perhaps broadcasters, sponsors that invest in and benefit very largely from the world of sport, might just think clean sport was a good idea and would like to help. â€ The strongest criticism came from the Canadian member Dick Pound, the founding Wada president who has been outspoken in calling for a complete ban on Russia and oversaw the original investigation that led to an outright ban of all but one Russian track and field athlete. â€œWe need to do a lot more to show we really do care about fair play, honest competition and clean athletes,â€ he said. By the end, however, Pound was among the 84 members who voted in favour. â€œThe arrowâ€™s left the bow,â€ he said. â€œThe decision has been made, itâ€™s not going to be changed between now and the start of the Games. â€ The world swimming governing body Fina moved to clarify the position of two swimmers, Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev, who were named in McLarenâ€™s report but have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport against their ban. â€œContrary to recent media reports, the eligibility of Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev to compete at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 has not been confirmed, and will not be confirmed until the IOCâ€™s   commission to review Russian entrants renders its final decision on these athletes, along with the other members of the Russian swimming team,â€ Fina said, â€œThe two athletes filled an appeal to Cas and Fina understands that this court has forwarded the case to the IOC   commission for final decision. â€ Cas is also due to rule on another Russian swimmer, Yuliya Yefimova, who appealed against the IOCâ€™s decision to ban all Russian athletes who had served a ban. That decision has been heavily criticised because athletes from other countries who have served a ban, such as Justin Gatlin, are eligible to compete.",375,209,"994372135685533701	994372483292647430	994372734950965250	994373111553449984	994376026821144577	994378356786454528	994384172381802496	994405991461670912	994452923437400065	994522753557409792	994547080650731520	994548272210632704	994552501650280448	994552797046628352	994556204256030720	994563621534478336	994563962892095488	994571531966734336	994591135770251265	994611049017028608	994618451317612544	994625756440420352	994631467677331456	994709133403176960	994764663958200320	994785417865068544	994788371322097664	994804884280086528	994806458863767552	994905892352069632	995003393528643584	995091841719721985	995301249217155072",fake

Put the tennis obituaries back in the file. Roger Federerâ€™s dream of a record eighth Wimbledon title is alive and well somehow after one of the most dramatic comebacks, even in his   career. Outgunned in the first two sets by the   Croat Marin Cilic, Federer pulled himself back from the dead, saving three   before squeezing out a   ( )       ( )   victory to secure a place in the   for the 11th time. It was a remarkable victory, his 10th from two sets down and one clinched with a 27th ace before celebrating with both arms thrust toward the sky. With his 35th birthday just around the corner and in a year in which he has been struck down with knee and back injuries, it may just go down as one of the most satisfying wins of his career. â€œWhen youâ€™re saving match points, when youâ€™re down two sets to love,     itâ€™s a moment when itâ€™s not in your control anymore,â€ said Federer, who now plays Canadaâ€™s No6 seed Milos Raonic, a         winner over the American Sam Querrey in Fridayâ€™s  . â€œBut I fought, I tried, I believed. At the end I got it done. So it was great on so many levels. This one is definitely huge because itâ€™s Centre Court at Wimbledon, and it still gives me the chance to win the tournament. â€ Federer is a confident beast rarely do we get the chance to see inside his psyche, any vulnerability kept well under wraps. But having missed the French Open with a back injury and having needed knee surgery in February, he arrived here lacking sharpness and miles in his legs. Four easy wins against significantly   opponents suggested he was playing well but even he has been surprised at his form. â€œI was very worried coming here,â€ he admitted. â€œI think it was huge for me to play the seven matches I did in Halle and Stuttgart. They served me very well. They gave me so much information to see what I could do, what I couldnâ€™t do, how I could play, how I couldnâ€™t play. â€œThen, knowing that I had a week in between, if I get through the first week here at Wimbledon   â€¦     I put myself in that position perfectly without dropping sets, which was a big surprise to me. Next thing, youâ€™re in the semis. Youâ€™re really deep into the tournament. I surprised myself in quite a big way actually. â€ Cilic beat Federer in the   at the US Open in 2014 on the way to his first grand slam title and for two sets it looked like he was about to do the same again. Though he was holding easily enough himself, Federer could not get a racket on the Cilic serve and the Croat played a superb   winning it   to take the first set and then one break, in the third game of the second, was enough to double his lead. The match turned on the seventh game of the third set, which was level at   when Federer escaped from   and then broke in the next game when Cilic  . The Swiss served out the set and though both missed break chances early in the fourth, Federer was hanging on. Cilic had three match points, the first at   the second at   and the third in the   only for Federer to come up with some clutch serving and when he took it   on his fifth set point, the worm had turned. Serving first in the deciding set, Federer had the edge and after missing a break point at   he finally broke for   and clinched victory with another ace out wide. Of his 27 aces, 15 came in the final two sets and Federer will now prepare to face Raonic, whom he beat at the same stage two years ago. Cilic was proud of his performance. â€œIt was a huge occasion and I played great tennis,â€ he said. â€œI was very close to the victory. Obviously itâ€™s not easy to deal with [the result]. â€œBut I have to take the positives and [think of] the great tennis that I managed to play. Itâ€™s the first time in my career I think that Iâ€™ve lost the match when I was two sets to love up but I havenâ€™t let myself down a little bit, physically or mentally. In all three sets [Federer won] I played pretty good tennis. â€œIf we would play again, I would try to be more aggressive on the chances when I had them in the fourth. Maybe there was a slight hesitation in some of them. The situation made it big. In those situations, I was not getting the best out of me. â€ As for Federer, who is now the oldest man since 1974 to make the Wimbledon   and draws level with Jimmy Connorsâ€™ open era best 11 appearances in the last four, the chance of an eighth title lives on. â€œI feel sorry for Marin but for me the dream continues,â€ he said. â€œI couldnâ€™t be happier, I thought I fought well and played   at the end. â€",919,435,,fake

The    who is gay, revealed he wanted to be a girl as he grew up and dressed exclusively as one when he was a child. He suggested that Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality and Olympian who was formerly Bruce Jenner, had made a mistake in undergoing gender transition and had â€œno clueâ€ what being transsexual involved. Everett, currently starring in the BBC1 show The Musketeers, told the Sunday Times magazine: â€œI really wanted to be a girl. Thank God the world of now wasnâ€™t then, because Iâ€™d be on hormones and Iâ€™d be a woman. After I was 15 I never wanted to be a woman again. â€  He believes parents who â€œget medicalâ€ are scary, saying: â€œItâ€™s nice to be allowed to express yourself, but the hormone thing, very young, is a big step. I think a lot of children have an ambivalence when theyâ€™re very young to what sex they are or what they feel about everyone. And there should be a way of embracing it. â€  He also spoke of how his former girlfriend Beatrice Dalle, the French actor, thought she might have been pregnant with his child. Everett told the magazine: â€œShe and I often talk about what would have happened if weâ€™d both had this child. And I would have loved to have had that child, actually. God, it probably would have been in rehab by now. â€  He also revealed that he was â€œturning into his motherâ€ and planned to move back in with her in Norfolk. â€¢ This article was amended on 20 June 2016.

politifact15017,http://christmasdailygifts.info/?p=2300,JUST IN: 45 States Just Banned Sharia Law. Do You Support This? – ChristmasGifts,"The use of migrant workers in the US seafood supply chain has led to the creation of exploitative conditions that are equivalent to forced labor, according to a report released on Wednesday.  The report was released by the National Guestworker Alliance (NGA) and is based on previous findings as well as interviews with 126 seafood processing workers in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and a range of   case studies. In order to succeed in a highly competitive global market, US seafood processors have increasingly come to rely on temporary labor. Such workers include   visa laborers as well as undocumented workers. Their immigration status makes these workers vulnerable to exploitation. The NGA found that these workers were unlikely to report abuse on the job due to threats from employers not to hire them in subsequent seasons and sponsor them for   visa. Undocumented workers have been threatened with immigration enforcement. â€œThis new research exposes a reality that workers know all too well,â€ said Daniel Castellanos, former   guest worker and a   of the NGA. â€œSeafood processing workers are routinely subjected to severe forms of exploitation by companies producing cheap seafood for major retailers and food distributors like Walmart. And when they speak out or try to resist abuse, they are punished severely for it. â€ A Walmart spokeswoman told the Guardian that the company cares about the men and women in its supply chain.  â€œWalmartâ€™s standards for suppliers lists our social and environmental expectations for our suppliers, specifically addressing working conditions, voluntary labor, pay, the cultivation of a safe and healthy work environment, and freedom of association,â€ she said. â€œWalmart also is committed to participating in collaborative efforts with external stakeholders to advance the goal of identifying risk and building a more transparent supply chain, including participation in industry groups that serve as a vehicle to share experiences and gain new information that can help improve operations and the global supply chains as a whole. â€ Among the indicators of forced labor detected by NGA in the US supply chain were verbal abuse, curfews, threats of denunciation to immigration authorities and poor treatment by supervisors. Those workers surveyed also reported having their wages stolen, not being paid overtime, and being paid less than originally promised. According to the report, a majority of workers processing scallops and groundfish in the large plants in New Bedford were hired on a temporary basis. The NGA also referenced a 2009 report that found nearly 75% of seafood processing workers in the city â€œwere undocumented migrants, generally hired through temp agenciesâ€. In Louisiana, seafood employers rely heavily on   visa workers. According to the NGA, utilization of   visas among seafood employers tripled between 1990 and 2000. â€œIn the 1970s, when I started my business, I was lucky enough to have the refugees from Vietnam come in, so we brought in roughly 40 of them to help us through that time,â€ Frank Randol, president of   crawfish processor Randol Inc told Congress last year. â€œOver the course of the years, we came to the 1990s when that started to wane just a little bit, we discovered the   program and started bringing in the guestworkers from Mexico. â€  Randol described the jobs at his processing plant as â€œone of Americaâ€™s least desired jobsâ€ and said that union activity has made it difficult for him to hire workers.  The NGA report was released at the end of the International Labour Conference, which is currently being held in Geneva. The NGA has called on the International Labour Organization (ILO) to â€œmove towards a binding legal convention regulating global value chainsâ€. The alliance also asked the ILO to organize a conference to explore the adverse impact of contracting and purchasing practices on migrant workersâ€™ rights, and to assemble research on how purchasing practices of multinational corporations affect core labor standards and the wages and benefits of workers. â€œEven on the end of seafood supply chains in the US, competition from   producers in Asia and elsewhere has created a powerful incentive for US processors to cut labor costs through wage theft, unsafe working conditions and at times forced labor conditions,â€ said JJ Rosenbaum, the

politifact14789,policetimes.info/?p=178,President Trump Just Saved Christmas For 13 Million Retirees,"Since Princeâ€™s death earlier this year, one of the great unanswered questions has been: what will happen to the vast amount of unreleased music in his vault? Last week, it was reported and then denied that his music was to be put up for sale. Now, we have news that it is to begin seeing the light of day. Donâ€™t get too excited, though, because thereâ€™s not going to be a great rush of songs. The big news for fans is that his 1984 album Purple Rain is to be reissued in a deluxe, remastered version, featuring a second disc of previously unreleased material. What that material might be is unknown, as is the release date. All that is known is that the record will emerge in early 2017, and will be based on plans agreed with Prince before his death in April. The Purple Rain reissue will be preceded by a new a new   compilation, Prince 4Ever, to be released next month. While that album is almost entirely greatest hits, thereâ€™s one treat for fans (or a shameless attempt to get them to shell out for music they already have, depending on your point of view) in the form of Moonbeam Levels, a previously unreleased track. Previously unreleased does not, in this case, mean previously unheard. The track is a   favourite among Prince fans, well enough known to have been covered in concert by Elvis Costello. You can find it on YouTube if you want to. It was recorded in July 1982, and included as the final track on the aborted album Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic  â€”   not the different Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic  â€”   before being shelved for Prince to work on the Batman soundtrack album.",660,471,"934234223724154881	934264676975771648	935454785934938113	935456105983037440	935593304053469185	935631906397409280	935638247514038272	937073526032433152	937238383914500096	937412176188284928	940028942970261505	940037670478127104	940066524802400256	940094813180903424	940413970774667265	940493798433583104	944537750451212288",fake
politifact13617,http://usanewstoday.org/index.php/2017/01/02/confirmed-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-resigning-post-associate-justice-supreme-court/,CONFIRMED ! JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS RESIGNING FROM THE POST OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT,"Donald Trump has made the most direct appeal of his campaign to African American voters as he battles to offset dismal polling among black voters and draw political capital from a recent spate of racially charged unrest in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Riots broke out in Milwaukeeâ€™s Sherman Park area on Saturday after the fatal police shooting of black    Sylville Smith, who police said pointed a firearm at an officer after fleeing a traffic stop. The overwhelmingly black neighborhood remained on edge after the city imposed a night curfew, fearing further unrest after arrests and gunfire on Sunday evening. Speaking at a rally on Tuesday night in the rural town of West Bend, 30 miles from Milwaukee, Trump, who has branded himself the â€œlaw and order candidateâ€ told an almost exclusively white audience that the rioting was â€œan assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and to live in peaceâ€  â€”   and said black people were the biggest victims of violence in their neighborhoods. â€œLaw and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities,â€ Trump said. â€œThe main victims of these riots are   African American citizens living in these neighborhoods. Itâ€™s their job, itâ€™s their homes, itâ€™s their schools and communities which will suffer the most as a result. â€ Trump said he was asking for â€œthe vote of every African American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different futureâ€. â€œIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths,â€ he said. â€œThe Democratic party has failed and betrayed the African American community. â€  Recent analysis has indicated that Trump is polling at around 2% with the African American electorate  â€”   worse than almost every Republican candidate since 1948  â€”   and is even behind the Green party nominee, Jill Stein, and libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, placing him fourth overall among black voters.  Party insiders have begun urging their nominee to increase his outreach in African American communities nationwide. He has done little to court the demographic, most recently rejecting invitations to speak at the annual conventions of the NAACP and the National Association of Black Journalists. Trumpâ€™s rally on Tuesday evening had been scheduled before unrest broke out in Milwaukee but he seized on the opportunity to accuse his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of being â€œagainst the policeâ€ and suggested she and other Democrats were directly responsible for rioting in the city and others around America. â€œThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  â€”   a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  â€”   share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country,â€ Trump said in a speech that was delivered using a teleprompter. The billionaire accused Clinton of preferring to â€œprotect the offender [rather] than the victimâ€ suggested that â€œa vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunitiesâ€. He argued that African Americans had been â€œhurt worstâ€ by Clintonâ€™s immigration policy. Trump reiterated claims first made during his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention in July, suggesting that â€œlaw and order must be restoredâ€ amid rising homicide rates in Americaâ€™s largest 50 cities. Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime has in fact declined to historic lows under the Obama administration. The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing â€œthe bestâ€ prosecutors and judges and pursuing â€œstrong enforcementâ€ of federal laws. This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, according to recent polling while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americansâ€™ support for police was at a   low and especially weakened among the African American population. Trumpâ€™s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of Americaâ€™s   history, was on sale outside of the rally. The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a   radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of Americaâ€™s most racially segregated metropolitan areas. â€œThatâ€™s the way they (black people) are in that city,â€ said Ken Schladweiler, a    from the small rural town of Neosho. â€œAll of that (unrest connected to Smithâ€™s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. Theyâ€™re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. Thatâ€™s just the way they are. â€ His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: â€œAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: donâ€™t they (black people) have work? Theyâ€™re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Donâ€™t they have work?â€ Julie Wanie, a    healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didnâ€™t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all. â€œI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows thatâ€™s a certain area you stay out of. â€ Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: â€œI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars. â€ In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released. â€œ  â€¦     The gun was pointed at his (a police officerâ€™s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? Thatâ€™s what the narrative is,â€ Trump said. â€œMaybe itâ€™s not true. If it is true, people shouldnâ€™t be rioting. â€ While Trumpâ€™s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists. Just hours before Trumpâ€™s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a   statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime. â€œNow more than ever itâ€™s important to have   conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trumpâ€™s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,â€ Serpas said.",2,363,"812145885383655424	813200298852220929	813208115126632448	813208655403290624	813512935695937540	813541491910078465	813545998316404740	813555854641426438	813591683342487552	813599678746992641	813787909610500096	813892110822895616	813903809038716929	813945828058550272	814050607359107072	814106681395253248	814152331994468352	814158407569645569	814165293673119744	814212316417978368	814239267711057920	814245223815663622	814245273522335744	814246720909381632	814257540473229313	814260418617208832	814260450082910208	814261429293359105	814268233356345344	814270477355065344	814273677843898368	814276385862811650	814276633100173312	814276854748237829	814280752158228480	814281275079098372	814281829461225473	814299923860639746	814300090361925632	814303069525536768	814315378683748352	814326032031420416	814337889182031873	814338447712407552	814343108234276867	814346525006561280	814348208273035265	814349062661087233	814363524432531456	814363991514431488	814425406161960960	814441497592471552	814449540266950656	814497062721126400	814502530012966917	814504176470331394	814550330419490816	814550688156024833	814559355471163392	814594569698426880	814597787904016385	814602007323561984	814650107262103552	814659102982991872	814691923881558016	814697867109662720	814902890405957632	814919782428504065	814931968018227200	814933636537413632	814938371911012353	815164626497339392	815815872086495232	816337379761868800	816452631430205440	816452630582935552	816452629203021825	816452627709841409	816452635179913217	816452634999717890	816452633615482880	816452632805928960	816452636543053824	816452636316553217	816459786598289408	816459792570949632	816459920904065024	816459922581786624	816459925782044673	816823992317255681	816977860762144768	817005219859070978	817172021268348929	817197101365022720	817215736347316225	817264826225299460	817540980190498816	817636970914598913	817805595776610306	817859180971204608	817922481281372160	818126678031482885	821066254224158720	821120346912866305	821248946588778498	821723445998350336	822969051244888065	822971439796121601	822978818562551808	822999001897271297	823018975533481984	823034581809004545	823048109072621568	823068321797066752	823077912236724224	823078372842622976	823094052275048452	823159614988488705	823160403186352132	823168302151245825	823184271057813504	823203614663393280	823205726965420033	823212830002413568	823219120678301696	823232170781118464	823232679617232896	823240623230746627	823247544612487169	823255284885950464	823255963650101248	823256111855915008	823258939634679812	823261096081358848	823270265715118084	823280241573588993	823321211379793922	823341166649192448	823375240508178439	823379802107367426	823383888714207232	823386598406553600	823400202367176704	823536663175565313	823583579741384705	823600888165994496	823607018040725505	823619475266240512	823620135344893952	823626214762016769	823662878926352384	823664477023404032	823699221064941568	823750718913990656	823860057456701440	823929511448285184	823935827319394304	824311335160684544	824390526220673024	824611669984870401	824613856655716353	824613865631526912	824613864071389184	824613871964938241	824613870698274816	824613876138258432	824642702147022848	824703169234173952	824713468574072832	824770205872189441	824826606531256321	826984089752317952	827518084802031616	850136752811425792	850726900448215040	851534036728250368	851579280677105664	851898752704983040	852008510694891521	854079073173217280	872265843710849025",fake

Yeah, we do need social programs to help the people that need help, but theyâ€™re just running rampant in this country right now. â€ Hover is not a rabid Trump supporter at a rally. He is an    computer science major at Hofstra University, in New York  â€”   where the   first presidential debate will be taking place on Monday night.  You might not expect to find many Trump supporters at an allegedly liberal college, but the Republican nomineeâ€™s reach is extensive, despite his litany of offensive comments towards women, ethnic minorities and his various political opponents. â€œThose are part of the things I donâ€™t agree with,â€ Hover said, when asked if he too, feels that Mexico is sending rapists to the US, and if he agrees with Trumpâ€™s treatment of women. â€œI do feel that gender equality and racial equality are more towards the top of what I like to see brought out in a presidential campaign,â€ Hover said. The    did not find too many issues with Trumpâ€™s other remarks on the trail. A recent poll showed Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by  % among those under 35. This year millennials (broadly speaking, people born between 1981 and 1997) overtook the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) as the largest generation in the US. Shanon Thomas, a    womenâ€™s studies and criminology major, is among those planning to vote for Clinton. Thomas said she wanted to hear the former New York senator address inequality during the debate. â€œShe will do a good job in bringing equality to this country,â€ Thomas said. â€œThatâ€™s the only way we can get ourselves back to being great  â€”   as opposed to what other candidates think make America great. â€ She was referencing the baseball hats that Trump has been wearing and selling as part of his campaign. Trumpâ€™s other business ventures have included a board game, vodka and meat.  An    political science major called Doreen, who asked that her last name not be published, said the candidates should focus on racial issues. â€œI think definitely things regarding police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement, that definitely is something that needs to be talked about,â€ she said. Doreen, who is African American, referenced the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. â€œI feel scared,â€ she said.  â€œWatching the video of what happened in Tulsa itâ€™s kind of like that could have been anybody.  â€œThat couldâ€™ve been my dad, that could have been anyone in the world that I know. â€",420,480,"961363014862721024	961598885645955073	977197257777930240	979766583240388608	983993262628274176	986617588179439617	986617595490160640	1000921483496042497	1000921801717764098	1000944677011578880	1001000103333670912	1001175139952840705	1001584481034174465	1001588555041271809	1006266949305655297	1042053944053252097	1042069537728806913	1042070068702543873	1042092320605331456	1042107099558412288	1042108506021609472	1042108705217568768	1042188824166653952	1042411661682987008	1042678018567622656	1042904165800980485",fake
politifact15266,https://boingboing.net/2018/04/09/fox-news-accidentally-puts-up.html,Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network,"Weâ€™ve never needed cheering up more though on the strictly escapist level, this film is maybe compromised by making one of its characters an obnoxious rich New York chump, a charmless lump, or do I mean grump, reliant on his fatherâ€™s money and nursing political ambitions. â€œHeâ€™s been mentioned as a future president,â€ says someone. Surely not. .. That entertainment enchanter JK Rowling has come storming back to the world of magic in a shower of supernatural sparks   and created a glorious   adventure, all about the wizards of   America and the diffident wizarding Brit who causes chaos in their midst with a bagful of exotic creatures. Itâ€™s a lovely performance from Eddie Redmayne who is a pretty fantastic beast himself. Thereâ€™s a moment when he has to â€œwhisperâ€ an errant animal into submission and his contortions would put Andy Serkis to shame. His Newt is a connoisseur, scientist and scatterbrained   taxonomist who is not far from the   Dr Who, a specless Potter or beardless Darwin. Redmayneâ€™s distinctively breathy voice even has something of the young Attenborough. With the openness and likability of his screen presence, and the sheer generosity of   energy, he and the cast are giving us an early Christmas treat.  Potter veteran David Yates directs and Rowling has adapted the Hogwarts textbook Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, by one Newt Scamander: the first name is short for â€œNewtonâ€ and nothing to do with the witchâ€™s ingredient. This was a fictional work of magical scholarship first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone and which Rowling herself wrote out and published in aid of Comic Relief a couple of years later. So who was Scamander? Rowling gives us the answer by converting this static encyclopaedia into a spectacular   about the origins of his book, set in New York City of the prewar era, 70 or 80 years before Philosopherâ€™s Stone. Does that make it a prequel? Sort of. There are a few hints and allusions, including a namecheck for Dumbledore. It promises to be the first of a series and it wouldnâ€™t surprise me to learn that Rowling already has every detail sorted out for the entire saga in architectural detail  â€”   and that she got it straight in her mind before writing the first Potter.  Fantastic Beasts is a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment with some breathtaking digital fabrications of prewar New York City. This is Steampunk 2. 0, taking its inspirations from Terry Gilliamâ€™s Brazil or Howard Hawksâ€™s His Girl Friday but the New York she creates also has the dark, traumatised look of Gotham City. The American wizards themselves are subject to an internal debate about their attitude to the civilians in America a muggle is known as a â€œ â€. Itâ€™s a schism that threatens to reach   proportions.  The donnish and unworldly Newt arrives in New York on the hunt for some rare species, and just so happens to be carrying quite a few exotic specimens himself in his battered suitcase with its worryingly insecure clasps. But the city in which he has just arrived has been threatened by some kind of dark   of dark magic, smashing its way through streets and buildings, which is called an obscurial.  Daft Newt causes calamity almost immediately on arriving by creating a rumpus in a bank with his animals  â€”   and a quirk of fate means he forms the unlikeliest of friendships with a   Jacob Kowlaski (a beguiling performance from Dan Fogler) an   stuck in a factory job but nursing big dreams about opening his own bakery. But Newt, our   gentleman amateur from across the pond, exasperates the US wizard authorities and in particular their tough operative Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who herself has issues with her superiors. Tina finds herself having to protect Newt and Jacob and brings our two amigos back to the apartment she shares with her telepathic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) who gets the hots for Jacob. And might there also be a spark between Newt and Tina? Meanwhile, creepy   activist Mary Lou (Samantha Morton) and her adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) appear to have a disquieting connection with top   Percival Graves (Colin Farrell). Itâ€™s a very Rowling universe, dense with fun, but always taking its own jeopardy very seriously and effortlessly making you do the same. The Beasts movies may actually make clearer Rowlingâ€™s   debt to Roald Dahl. They also show that her universe with its exotic fauna is in the best way, a cousin to that of George Lucas.  There is a strange pleasure of seeing how her magic itself is as potent as ever. The muggle or   world we are seeing is nearly a century old, but the basic language and furniture and procedure of magic is not in any way older or rudimentary. It is the same thing. They have moving pictures on newspapers in the same way as the present day. As ever, magic is a state within a state, a secret in plain sight, and part of the fun is being let in on the secret.  Katherine Waterston is great as Tina and perhaps gives the Rowling universe what it never quite had until now: a really strong young female lead who could tackle the bad guys on equal terms with the man   as well as having the chops for romance.  Rowling and Yates have given us a terrifically   unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film. Thereâ€™s a scene in a speakeasy where someone orders â€œsix shots of  . â€ This film felt to me like twelve.

politifact15349,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/daily-shows-michelle-wolf-lands-her-own-netflix-late-night-show-1083705,'The Daily Show's' Michelle Wolf Lands Her Own Netflix Late-Night Show (Exclusive),"A US government request to trawl through the personal data of millions of users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase signals the start of an effort to pull digital currencies like bitcoin into the mainstream, experts have said. The â€œJohn Doeâ€ summons, a broad order for data on all Coinbase users in 2013, 2014 and 2015, was filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a federal court in California on 17 November. In the summons, the IRS said that all of Coinbaseâ€™s users in that period â€œhave not been or may not be complying with US internal revenue lawsâ€. Coinbase has said it will fight the request in court. Cryptocurrencies  â€”   digital assets which exist entirely online but are exchangeable for goods or services  â€”   have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because they grant a degree of user anonymity. Coinbase is the largest bitcoin exchange and its   brand. But user confidentiality has also caused headaches for governments, who worry the currencies are being used for drug dealing, money laundering or tax evasion. Digital currencies are currently taxed as an asset like gold, with capital gains tax due when there is an appreciation in value. However, the extent to which bitcoin users with US tax liabilities have been declaring such assets is unclear.  In documentation supporting its petition, the IRS referred to three anonymous cases of taxpayers who had used virtual currencies to evade tax, two of which were â€œcorporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollarsâ€ which used Coinbase wallets and concealed bitcoin transactions as â€œtechnology expensesâ€ on their tax returns. Several experts in cryptocurrency said that the IRS was on a â€œfishing expeditionâ€ and pointed out that it followed an excoriating report by the US treasuryâ€™s   for taxation which said the IRS was not doing enough to regulate and investigate cryptocurrencies. â€œThe government has no idea that anybody has committed a crime,â€ said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a lobbying and research group focused on cryptocurrencies. In a statement, Coinbase said: â€œAlthough Coinbaseâ€™s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the governmentâ€™s request. â€ It added: â€œIn its current form, we will oppose the governmentâ€™s petition in court. â€ Some experts, though dismayed by what they saw as the overly broad and invasive nature of the request, said that more government scrutiny on cryptocurrencies was inevitable as they became more mainstream.  â€œItâ€™s an indication of bitcoinâ€™s growing adoption,â€ said Chris Burniske, an analyst at ARK Investment Management who focuses on bitcoin. â€œAs more people use it, it is going to grow in a way which affects national and global economies, so the IRS needs more clarity on how citizens are using it,â€ he said. â€œGlobally, weâ€™re seeing regulators grapple with how to regulate and tax [cryptocurrencies]. â€  Others said that while they felt Coinbase was right to seek to narrow the scope of the request, some change was needed to bring bitcoin and its ilk out of the dark and into the world of mainstream finance.  â€œIf bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be viewed as legitimate financial instruments, there has to be some regulatory apparatus here,â€ said Kevin McIntyre, associate professor of economics at McDaniel College in Maryland. â€œCertainly,â€ he added, â€œthe tinfoil   libertarian types who embrace the privacy of [bitcoin] are going to be very disappointed. â€ Not all of them, however. Juan Llanos, an advisor in financial technology regulation and compliance, said he was seeing a lot of anger within the cryptocurrency industry at the IRSâ€™s move, but also some schadenfreude from the more anarchistic parts of bitcoinâ€™s user base.  â€œCoinbase has been attacked by   from the beginning, because they are the closest to a digital bank there is,â€ he said. â€œMany anarchists  â€”   usually the early adopters of bitcoin  â€”   who are against the customs of Coinbase are celebrating,â€ he said. This is not the first time the IRS has used blanket John Doe summonses as part of an investigation, though it is possible that the Coinbase request will be the largest of its kind.

politifact15037,www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ww8j1/russian_source_behind_trump_dossier_killed_in/,"Russian source behind Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead. : conspiracy","Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested in cities across the US this weekend, as protests against police shootings intensified and new details emerged about the motivations and plans of a man who killed five officers in Dallas. During a weekend of protests over killings by police, more than 160 people were arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where demonstrations continued to grow over the fatal shooting by officers last week of Alton Sterling, a    African American, as he was pinned down during a struggle.   vehicles, teargas and smoke grenades returned to American streets for the first time this summer, and Barack Obama appealed for calm and said those who attack law enforcement undermine the cause of social justice. The unrest built as authorities in Dallas said Micah Johnson, who opened fire on officers late last Thursday, had been plotting a wider bombing campaign that could have had â€œdevastating effectsâ€. Johnson was said to have been seeking revenge for the policeâ€™s treatment of African Americans.  Among the protesters arrested was DeRay Mckesson, a   national leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said Mckesson was arrested for blocking a street even as video he was livestreaming at the time of his detention indicated that he was off the roadway. He was released from custody late Sunday with a charge of â€œsimple obstruction of a highway of commerceâ€. Protesters complained they were being denied their rights to peaceful assembly. â€œIn cities across America, police are responding to peaceful protests with provocation, violence, and unconstitutional arrests,â€ said Samuel Sinyangwe, a prominent activist with the group Campaign Zero and a close ally of Mckessonâ€™s. Another 100 people were arrested during clashes with police in and around St Paul, Minnesota, where the death of Philando Castile after his shooting by a police officer last week was broadcast live on Facebook, causing widespread public anger. As protesters blocked an interstate highway, police flooded streets in Bearcat military vehicles and used smoke bombs to break up demonstrations. The police chief, Todd Axtell, said about 20 of his officers had been struck with bottles, rocks and other items pelted at them by crowds, which he said was â€œa disgraceâ€. Dozens more protesters were detained by police during protests in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore and Phoenix, where police used teargas and pepper spray to disperse crowds. More protests were planned for late on Sunday, including in St Louis, Missouri, where in August 2014 an unarmed black    was killed in the suburb of Ferguson in a flashpoint that continues to reverberate two years later. Tensions have risen even as the city of Dallas mourns the   killings of five police officers last week by Johnson, a    army veteran and member of the New Black Panther party. On Sunday, the Dallas police chief, David Brown, said investigators had found   equipment and written evidence indicating that Johnson was plotting attacks â€œlarge enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our north Texas areaâ€. â€œWeâ€™re convinced that this suspect had other plans, and thought what he was doing was righteous,â€ he added. Brown said Johnson had apparently been planning to â€œtarget law enforcement, and make us pay for what he sees as law enforcementâ€™s efforts to punish people of colourâ€ since before last weekâ€™s fatal shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, which merely triggered his actions. The police chief disclosed that Johnson had daubed the letters â€œRBâ€ in his own blood on a wall of the parking garage where he was cornered and eventually killed by a police robot. The significance of the initials were unclear. Investigators have also learned that Johnson had practiced   drills in his backyard and trained at a private   school that teaches special tactics, including â€œshooting on the moveâ€ a technique in which an attacker fires and quickly changes position, to keep his location uncertain and create the impression of multiple assailants. The deaths of Sterling and Castile had had apparently moved Johnson to act before his more ambitious plan could be realised, Brown said. The gunman had kept a journal of combat tactics, Brown said, but his writings included â€œquite a bit of rambling in the journal thatâ€™s hard to decipherâ€.  The police chief also revealed details of the   standoff between the gunman and police, which ended when officers sent a robot carrying a pound of C4 explosive to detonate near Johnson. The gunman, hidden in a brick corner where snipers could not see him and officers could not safely approach, demanded to speak only with a black police negotiator, Brown said. â€œHe lied to us, laughing, playing games, singing, asking how many did he get and saying he wanted to kill some more,â€ he said. The police chief eventually made the decision to improvise with the robot. â€œI began to feel he was going to charge us and take out many more before we would kill him,â€ Brown said, adding: â€œI approved [the decision] and Iâ€™d do it again under the same circumstances. â€ Obama cut short a visit to Europe early this week and will travel to Dallas before convening a summit at the White House between police chiefs and community leaders. Speaking Spain on Sunday, he defended the â€œmessy and controversialâ€ tradition of American protest but reiterated his condemnation of violence against law enforcement. â€œWhenever those of us who are concerned about failure of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause,â€ Obama said. Also on Sunday, Dallasâ€™s mayor, Mike Rawlings, said marchers carrying weapons and dressed in body armor had distracted law enforcement from the actual gunman on Thursday, telling CBSâ€™s Face the Nation that other individuals carrying guns on the scene â€œtook our eye off the ball for a momentâ€. â€œYou can carry a rifle legally and when you have gunfire going on, you usually go with the person thatâ€™s got a gun,â€ he said. â€œAnd so our police grabbed some of those individuals, took them to police headquarters and worked it out and figured out that they were not the shooters. But that is one of the real issues with the gun rights issues that we face  â€”   that in the middle of a firefight, itâ€™s hard to pick out the good guys and the bad guys. â€ He added that investigators were talking to Johnsonâ€™s neighbors and family to learn whether â€œthereâ€™s anybody that aided and abetted him, conspired with him. We donâ€™t have any new news on that regard. That is probably going to take some days. â€",433,793,"962788790338174976	962820780814815233	962824432451436544	962824469432754177	962830893302738944	962838875491233792	962842912919826432	962853215447302145	962854719205986304	962856747953205248	962860128054726656	962862153387642880	962862775243591681	962866488930656256	962874050736373763	962874971184869378	962876618770452481	962885962748563456	962889649780699136	962889968749301760	962890178854576129	962892578344628224	962893967300808704	962896663827369984	962898261706264576	962900028590346243	962903290248941568	962903543480045575	962903578762457088	962904225133903872	962904783685390343	962906190450708480	962908218056953856	962915929716940800	962916688911093760	962917424218738688	962917534667300864	962919719199129600	962922756529623040	962922919717257216	962923776680906752	962923963868356608	962923961620271104	962925082694832128	962926722579599362	962929681254281216	962930269459308546	962933098324418560	962933571009826816	962940598947909632	962940725108379648	962949417270697986	962949475433140224	962953667786805248	962957358010793985	962996432021188608	963000657580982272	963000896631332864	963010795453014022	963018455007006721	963018796989648896	963019996510212096	963020330179743744	963025196960624641	963026671317250048	963027434504323073	963030724118044672	963030828010876928	963031529776713728	963033418387869697	963036950394413056	963039609440542721	963041881096704000	963042463228289024	963043864754794496	963044510174359552	963045280227655680	963052282664255488	963053151627726848	963053186650071040	963064348360040448	963065337867534337	963065985266790400	963073481884733440	963075657407258624	963076250829910016	963076682931425280	963077366921814016	963078747199909888	963081290739343360	963081641953460225	963084245861154820	963086251988578304	963086975694704643	963088173285953536	963089196582932480	963089740466675712	963093004553682944	963094251444809728	963107397173694465	963108545125343234	963110337816944640	963114650928893953	963114655165091841	963114953086570496	963115897685790720	963118655809650688	963121409814925313	963128815185641472	963129157990436864	963136698749259777	963136870430511104	963139603875225600	963141764042309632	963148181339975690	963149548221804544	963157255972466688	963163874865401856	963164955838001153	963174602372501507	963174965842513927	963195513234427904	963200466954964992	963220489194831872	963226025239941120	963228173398953984	963230616664858625	963276122241683457	963286964756627456	963306362234171397	963345232011186176	963350909425278976	963365350724300800	963382419377328130	963397737256333313	963398890459365377	963404256509349888	963409034962497536	963451449786163201	963453654303993856	963461249748078592	963492383819206656	963508344026693633	963510133430063105	963576116677095426	963593012189184000	963855061272223744	963907638948806656	964094539303546881	964125509234954240	964220564641476608	964565853244141568	964937881960710144	968544557821583360	986613160244367360	1056234561632374787",fake
politifact14144,http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/254852337-story,Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death,"As if the routine vulgarities of Donald Trump havenâ€™t made politics depressing enough, the New York state assembly is now on its second year of debating whether or not to rename State Route 107 in Oyster Bay, Long Island, â€œBilly Joel Boulevardâ€ in honor of the Piano Man himself. While fellow   Bob Dylan is basking in the glory of a Nobel Prize for literature, Billy Joel canâ€™t even get the state of New York to write his name on a street sign. Someone should write a song about that. The crux of the argument over the renaming is that Joel is not yet deceased, making the honor premature. People who get streets and roads named after them and statues erected in their likeness tend to be two things: male, as this New Yorker article points out, and dead. Billy Joel is definitely a man, as you would know if youâ€™ve heard the song Big Shot, but unfortunately for his bid for getting a patch of asphalt named after him, heâ€™s still ticking. Never in my gravest nightmares did I imagine that Christie Brinkleyâ€™s   could be a wedge issue in an election involving human adults in the year 2016. This could only be dumber if the debate was over whether or not to name an abandoned subway tunnel after Rick Springfield. â€œMy opponent is either impotent or is simply not trying, because everyone loves Billy Joel,â€ Democratic assembly candidate Dean Hart said about incumbent Republican Michael Montesano in a press release issued on Thursday. Yes, he issued a press release. The world must know! Michael Montesano doesnâ€™t care about classic rock!  â€œNext to Teddy Roosevelt, Long Island really doesnâ€™t have a more famous or popular person than Billy Joel,â€ Hart continues. Bit of a gulf in significance there. We go from a former president of the United States to the man famous for writing Scenes from an Italian Restaurant. Excuse me, but Long Island also gave us guitarist Joe Satriani, Amy Fisher, Stuttering John Melendez from the Howard Stern Show, and former NFL quarterback Vinnie Testaverde. Iâ€™d mention Thomas Pynchon, but Iâ€™ve clearly already proved my point. Nevertheless, hasnâ€™t Billy Joel done enough, his supporters ask? The residents of suburban New York donâ€™t even bother hiring a DJ for their weddings any more. They just play The Nylon Curtain on repeat and no one complains. But more importantly, shouldnâ€™t Billy Joel get to see Billy Joel Boulevard before he departs this earth? I might not be much of a fan of his, but as a fellow human, I can sympathize with those who want to recognize him while heâ€™s still around. Consider the funeral. Your loved ones dress you up in expensive clothes, toss you in a box lined with silk or velvet, then eat a bunch of cheese and drink a few glasses of wine at midday. They say wonderful things about you, pray that youâ€™ve gone to a bespoke afterlife that caters to your every whim, and, most importantly, remark on how good you look. â€œThey did a great job cleaning Dave up,â€ theyâ€™ll say as they gawp at my eerily beatific, rotting corpse. I donâ€™t get to see any of that  â€”   Iâ€™m dead! No wine, no cheese, no silk prison box, and no fancy suit. All the best parts of being dead are lost on the corpse. Why deny Billy Joel the right to see his name slapped on a green road sign before he travels â€œuptownâ€ for real. These sorts of honors really only serve one purpose, and thatâ€™s to lend the honoree a semblance of immortality. Your body might quit working, but there will always be that road for kids to ask their exasperated parents, â€œwhoâ€™s Billy Joel?â€ The more roads, bridges, burn units, sports arenas, museums and vape shops with our names on them, the greater chance we have of not fading into obscurity. At least, thatâ€™s the theory. Nevermind that Billy Joel is already the guy who sang Only the Good Die Young (thatâ€™s a bit of a laugh now, eh? ).  Granted, youâ€™ll still very much not alive, no matter how many places someone has scribbled your name. Also, State Route 107 might be ripped up and replaced with a tube system for   cars in the next 50 years. For now, at least, Billy Joel should be able to drive over a stretch of road bearing his name. Itâ€™s as close as any of us get to enjoying our inevitable demise.

politifact15307,http://www.newsfeedusa.us/2018/04/obamas-private-security-company-sets-up.html,OBAMA’S PRIVATE ‘SECURITY’ COMPANY SETS UP MASSIVE CAMPS OUTSIDE 3 MAJOR CITIES,"Chess has dropped almost completely from the public eye in the four decades since Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky waged their Cold War proxy battle in Reykjavik. This monthâ€™s world chess championship match in New York City will do little to reverse that course despite the organizersâ€™ best intentions, but early returns suggest the taut showdown between champion Magnus Carlsen and challenger Sergey Karjakin may not be as straightforward as initially suspected. It marks the first time New York has played host to a world title match since 1995, when Garry Kasparov retained his title against Viswanathan Anand on the   observatory deck in the south tower of the World Trade Center. For the past week Carlsen and Karjakin have faced off in a   studio within a sleek   arena on the third floor of the Fulton Market Building, only four blocks east from where the towers once stood. A   mirror allows spectators to watch the players in action, by themselves save for two silent arbiters, lending a   feel to the spectacle. Prices range from $75 for general admission to $1, 200 for VIP lounge access, where   can suck down vodka cocktails and rub elbows with grandmasters, financiers and the odd celebrity. Woody Harrelson, an avid player himself, spent most of the first two days taking challenges from   on the outdoor balcony overlooking the East River while Carlsen and Karjakin faced off inside. The     match began on Friday, with each contestant awarded one point for a win and a   for a draw. So far Carlsen and Karjakin have drawn all four games theyâ€™ve played and enter Thursdayâ€™s fifth meeting deadlocked at  . Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion, earning the winnerâ€™s share of a roughly $1. 1m prize fund. Carlsen, who is 25, was already regarded as the worldâ€™s best player even before he saw off Anand for the championship in Chennai three years ago and is the closest thing to a star in the sport today. Heâ€™s done ads for Porsche, modeled for   Raw alongside Liv Tyler and Lily Cole and enjoys a massive presence in his native Norway, where NRK is broadcasting the games in prime time. He is handsome and media trained, perhaps overly so, giving off the air of an unthreatening playboy. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history, a point frequently cited by those who have called him the greatest player ever. Karjakin, 26, earned the right to challenge for the title in March by making it through the Candidates Tournament in Moscow, where he defeated a series of   opponents, among them Brooklynâ€™s Fabiano Caruana. He was born in Ukraine, where he became an international grandmaster at 12 years old (a record that still stands) but adopted Russian citizenship in 2009. He is married with a son, an avowed supporter of Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Crimea, and speaks with a stutter that surfaces more in English than his native tongue. He is ranked ninth in the world. Karjakin is a player in the classical mold known for his resilience. Carlsen is known for his adaptability, which enables a flair for the unpredictable not commonly seen among top players. â€œ[Carlsen] has practically no weaknesses,â€ the Russian said at last weekâ€™s   press conference before more than one hundred credentialed media.  Any expectations of the political intrigue and paranoia associated with the sportâ€™s golden age were not disappointed. Israel Gelfer, the vice president of the world chess federation, spoke on behalf of the governing body only because Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was barred from entering the country due to his ties to the Syrian government and the Central Bank of Syria. At one point Carlsen fielded a question over the rumors that heâ€™d enlisted Microsoft for cybersecurity consultation over concerns Karjakinâ€™s team were trying to hack his preparations. No fewer than two questions were posed about   never mind that Carlsen and Karjakin were years away from being born when the Match of the Century took place. This time around in New York, the chess eventually went off, no doubt to the organizersâ€™ relief, and it didnâ€™t take long for the first surprise. Carlsen, handling the white pieces, played the   Trompowsky Attack in Fridayâ€™s first game, a   opening heâ€™d later confess was at least partially inspired by the name of Americaâ€™s newly minted  . The Norwegian played fast and it seemed like heâ€™d outprepared his rival, but Karjakin managed to scratch back to force a mostly forgettable draw after 42 moves. Karjakin played the far more familiar Ruy Lopez in Saturdayâ€™s second game, prompting a Morphy Defense from Carlsen. That also ended in a draw, this time on the 33rd move. After Sundayâ€™s rest day the players reconvened for Game 3, a   of a contest that saw Karjakin recover from a misstep on his 30th move before defending brilliantly as Carlsen tried to press his advantage and draw first blood. But after seven tense, excruciating hours, Karjakin managed to salvage a draw when the champion missed a move in the endgame that would have assured checkmate.  Moments later, they agreed to a draw after 78 moves. That left a short turnaround for the following dayâ€™s game, where Karjakin recovered yet again to force a   marathon that ended in another draw and kept the match level. The resilience that Carlsen had praised on the eve of the match has proven the critical talking point as the match enters the middle act: â€œSergey has studied the game very well, is very knowledgeable and, most of all, heâ€™s extremely resilient in defense. Heâ€™s very, very good in finding resources even in difficult positions, finding positions he can defend.  â€œFor me, itâ€™s a matter of when I get the chance, Iâ€™ll try to punch him until he finally knocks over. â€ It seems inevitable that Carlsenâ€™s blows will find their target, but for now the Russian underdog is very much in the fight.",397,631,"933535990907658240	933601911156047872	933777652397363205	933857715989958656	933935159568687104	934050125655216128	934252985894555648	934474972784943109	936201861182271488	942511347253866496	942536227433209858	944545955793326080	985852136385863681	986361323582836737	986851128489971713	986986064622637062	987067559152443394	987079679998865409	987091520485560320	987108005362720768	987112521667661824	987139471694008320	987162161825935360	987191845397688320	987212625468641280	987319859817209862	987335196763672577	987357590274433025	987370742953242625	987372256316837890	987418936684793856	987436546675666944	987466736248217600	987943797320486913	988070450407362560	988080055355166725	988104140759986178	988181119987339265	988186149825982464	988203188884070400	988347524556705792	988404217458110465	988971885286363137	1013490253003481088",fake

Fake news and Russian interference  â€”   either by influencing fake news sites, or by hacking or misinformation  â€”   are viewed as a serious threat to the democratic process, particularly since the US presidential elections. From rumours that Merkel was in the east German secret police, the Stasi, to others suggesting she is Adolf Hitlerâ€™s daughter, Germans are also proving themselves susceptible to false information. The most blatant example of fake news to hit Germany so far occurred earlier this year over reports that a    girl of Russian origin, known as Lisa F, had been raped in Berlin by refugees from the Middle East. The story received extensive coverage on Russian and German media who reported the allegations that she had been abducted on her way to school and  . The attack turned out to have been fabricated, as Berlinâ€™s chief of police was quick to point out. According to Berlinâ€™s public prosecutorâ€™s office the girl had spent 30 hours with people known to her, and a medical examination proved she had not been raped. But having been shared widely on social media and through Russian news sites, hundreds took to the streets to protest at the â€œattackâ€ along with far right and   groups. Sergey Lavrov, Russiaâ€™s foreign minister went so far as to accuse Merkelâ€™s government of â€œsweeping the case under the carpetâ€ heightening suspicions in Berlin that the Kremlin was deliberately trying to cause trouble. There are suspicions that the story was spread in the first place by Russian elements keen to undermine the refugee policy of Angela Merkel. She is viewed as a key enemy to Russia over her tough stance on Ukraine. The ultimate aim is said to be to destabilise her domestically just as she has said she will stand for a fourth term in office. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine   MaaÃŸen  â€”   the head of the BfV, Germanyâ€™s domestic security agency,  â€”   accused Russia of using   techniques of misinformation. Addressing the Bundestag on the subject last week, Merkel said: â€œToday we have fake sites, bots, trolls  â€”   things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms, and we have to learn to deal with them. â€ Fake news has also spread to neighbouring Austria and been used to discredit both candidates in this weekendâ€™s presidential election. Most startling have been the attacks on the   independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen, whose opponents have attempted to spread the news that he is suffering from dementia and is gravely ill.  Kate Connolly, Over the last 10 years, France has seen a sharp increase in the readership of alternative,   sites, blogs and social media operations, referred to collectively as the fachosphÃ¨re  â€”   (â€œfachoâ€ is slang for fascist). Promoting views including   nativism and   these sites are run independently, rather than by a political party. But they feed into a mood of distrust of the traditional media, both on the far right and the far left. Samuel Laurent, head of Le Mondeâ€™s   section, Les dÃ©codeurs, said: â€œIn France, there isnâ€™t a wide presence of totally invented fake news that makes money through advertising, as seen in the US. â€ But he said France was seeing increasing cases of manipulation and distortion, particularly during election periods.  One example, in the recent primary race to choose the French rightâ€™s presidential candidate, was a campaign on the fachosphÃ¨re to claim the   candidate Alain JuppÃ© was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The accusation dated back to local elections in 2014 when distorted stories circulated on a   opinion website, accusing JuppÃ© of wanting to build a â€œ â€ in Bordeaux, where he is mayor. The story grew and was embellished during the primary campaigns to portray JuppÃ© as a Muslim   â€œAli JuppÃ©â€. JuppÃ© said a â€œdisgusting campaignâ€ had been run against him.  Laurent said: â€œI think the French presidential election campaign [next spring] will be fraught with this type of thing. â€ In January, as the presidential election campaign prepares to kick off, Le Mondeâ€™s Les dÃ©codeurs will launch a database of questionable sites that portray themselves as information sites. The recent Paris terrorist attacks were also subject to conspiracy theories and distortions, including reports this summer that gunmen who killed 90 people at a rock gig at the Bataclan last November had mutilated their victims. These reports cited partial evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the attacks, without adding that the inquiry also heard officials deny that any mutilation took place. There is also an ongoing row over fake information websites about abortion in France. The lower house of the French parliament has approved government plans to ban fake abortion information websites which masquerade as neutral, official sites with   helpline numbers but which the government said promote   propaganda and pressure women not to terminate pregnancies. The womenâ€™s minister, Laurence Rossignol, told parliament on Thursday that   groups in France were setting up sites â€œthat appear neutral and objectiveâ€ and copy official government information sites but were â€œdeliberately seeking to trick womenâ€. She said these sites often had helplines run by â€œ  activists with no training who want to make women feel guilty and discourage them from seeking an abortion. â€  Angelique Chrisafis  A Burmese friend recently put it like this: in the old days, people went to the tea shop to get their news. Now, they go to Facebook. After decades of isolation under successive military regimes, Myanmarâ€™s 51 million people began to come online rapidly in 2014 after telecoms reforms. They leapfrogged the era of   and desktops, starting with mobile phones and social media. For many, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. With scores of voices clamoring to be heard for the first time, itâ€™s a dynamic, sometimes dangerous space. As well as â€œ#foreveraloneâ€ statuses and a barrage of updates from staunchly   media organizations, news feeds are crammed with fake content. Much of it is tinged with religious hatred. With tensions between the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim populations running high, many are ready to believe vitriolic nonsense about Islam and its followers, often propagated by nationalist accounts set up for the purpose. A Muslim journalist was recently the victim of a campaign by some of these accounts, when a widely followed nationalist posted pictures of him juxtaposed with images of an unknown Rohingya Muslim militant. The post claimed he was involved in attacks on border police and called for his immediate arrest.  Nothing happened  â€”   the post was eventually taken down, though not before more than 3, 000 people shared it. But the episode was a hint of the frightening power that fake news can have in a context like Myanmar. Poppy McPherson, In Italy, the spread of propaganda has become such a worry for the government that a top official in prime minister Matteo Renziâ€™s circle of advisers recently filed a defamation complaint against a mystery Twitter account  â€”   it has since disappeared  â€”   who tweeted under the name â€œBeatrice di Maioâ€ and routinely took aim at Renziâ€™s government. In one example, the Twitter account showed a picture of Elena Boschi, the reform minister, on the phone. It suggested she was sharing insider information with her father, who was a top executive at Banca Etruria, a Tuscan bank. The bank was rescued by the Italian government in 2015 but there is no evidence that Boschi helped her father or committed wrongdoing.  In Italy the attacks against Renzi have been stepped up ahead of the critical 4 December referendum. In some cases, news about Italy reported by Russian   website RT Today has been especially skewed against the prime minister. In one case highlighted by La Stampa, the Italian daily, the Russian website falsely claimed that a rally in Rome held by supporters of Renzi ahead of the referendum were actually his opponents. The story has since been removed.  Members of Renziâ€™s Democratic party have complained that â€œ â€ websites controlled by the   Five Star Movement, which abhors traditional political advertising, are to blame for spreading false and defamatory news about the governmentâ€™s activities.  Stephanie Kirchgaessner, As reports emerged that fake news had influenced the US presidential election, China trumpeted its system of a â€œinternet managementâ€ portraying freedom of speech as broken when it can affect the outcome of an election. â€œChina is on its way to strengthening internet management,â€ said an editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid affiliated with the Communist party mouthpiece Peopleâ€™s Daily. â€œThe western democratic system appears to be unable to addressâ€ the problems and conflict unleashed by the internet, the paper added. The fake news that spread on Facebook in the   to the election even spread to China. Articles originally posted on   websites, including Breitbart, were directly translated into Chinese and shared on the countryâ€™s social media platforms.  Problems with fake news and fraudulent reporters have existed for over a decade in China, with people often presenting themselves as journalists and threatening companies with negative coverage in an attempt to extort money. In one   case, a journalist was paid more than $70, 000 to write negative stories about a construction equipment manufacturing company, sending its shares tumbling. But the authorities have seized on the phenomenon as a justification to censor a   of content. In 2013, the government launched a crackdown on online â€œ â€ targeting influential users on the   website Sina Weibo, but it was widely seen as an attempt to stem criticism of the ruling Communist party. More recently, Chinese authorities have clamped down on â€œfake newsâ€ they feel harms social cohesiveness, targeting â€œrumoursâ€ that affected property prices in Shanghai or stories the government says increase antagonism between urban and rural residents.  Earlier this year Chinaâ€™s cyberspace administration issued new rules designed to curb the number of stories using information culled from social media, stating â€œit is forbidden to use hearsay to create news or use conjecture and imagination to distort the factsâ€. News outlets cannot use information posted on social media without prior approval, it said. More recently a top official at the administration suggested there should be a database to identify internet usersâ€™ true identities so they could be â€œrewarded and punishedâ€. China maintains extensive control over the internet and many foreign websites, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube, are all blocked by a government program known as â€œthe Great Firewallâ€.  The countryâ€™s vast censorship system that imposes media blackouts on topics ranging from missteps by Chinaâ€™s leadership to investigating corruption cases. A recent directive banned websites from live streaming coverage of the US election. Benjamin Haas, Brazil has a growing problem with fake news and its importance has grown as political opinion polarized following the close   victory of leftist president Dilma Rousseff in 2014 and her controversial impeachment in August this year. According to a BBC Brasil report from April 2016, as the impeachment process that Rousseff and her supporters called a politically motivated coup began heating up, three out of the five most shared news stories on Facebook were false.  A story shared by the Pensa Brasil (Think Brasil) site that falsely said that federal police wanted to know why Rousseff had given 30bn reais ($9bn) to the giant meat company Friboi came third in the ranking with 90, 150 shares.  Last year Brazilian journalist Tai Nalon left her job at the Folha de S Paulo, one of Brazilâ€™s leading newspapers, to found the site Aos Fatos (To The Facts)  â€”   Brazilâ€™s first   site. â€œThere is a lot of false news,â€ Nalon said in an email interview, â€œbut I would be cautious about saying the problem is similar to what happens in the USAâ€. Instead, she said there are politically motivated pages that reinterpret and distort existing stories from big news outlets and that much of what they share is more biased opinion than pure falsehood. But plenty of false stories do circulate on Brazilâ€™s garrulous internet. The   investigation into the Petrobras scandal, called Operation Car Wash, was a key driver in Rousseffâ€™s impeachment. Although she has never been accused of graft, many in her party have been and the scandal prompted huge street demonstrations calling for her removal. BuzzFeed Brasil this month published this story about how more false news about the operation has been published than real. This year, the 10 most popular false news stories about Car Wash were shared 3. 9m times, BuzzFeed said, citing Facebook data. The 10 most popular real stories were shared 2. 7m times. Dominic Phillips, Fake news is not a problem of any scale in Australia: the media market, dominated by a handful of key players serving a population of just over 21 million people, does not seem fragmented enough. But Australia is not immune to issues with untruths spreading on Facebook. Over half the population (13. 3 million as at end of June) is connected to the internet of that number, more than half is believed to be active on Facebook. Some issues seem to be more of a lightning rod for untruths in Australia than others. The link between the halal certification industry and terrorism  â€”   repeated by politicians despite a lack of evidence  â€”   was so persistent that an inquiry was held late last year. Concerns over halal certification  â€”   often failing to completely mask rampant Islamophobia  â€”   flourished on Facebook, even after the inquiry found there was no basis to the connection. The Boycott Halal in Australia group has close to 100, 000 members on Facebook. In November 2014, it shared a satirical news article, apparently under the impression it was true. The post was subsequently deleted, but the page is a hotbed for views that have no basis in fact, as is the page for supporters of the Q Society, which bills itself as â€œAustraliaâ€™s leading   movementâ€. Pauline Hanson, a fringe figure in rightwing politics who is outspoken against Islam, was   to the senate in the federal election in July with support that surprised many pundits. Her One Nation party took four seats in the   senate this year and the party is expected to do well in the Queensland state elections. Parallels have been drawn between her return to politics and Trumpâ€™s election: both have embraced social media, where they have significant followings, and are similarly unfazed by evidence. In August, research showed 62% of voters agreed with the statement: â€œI might not personally agree with everything she says but she is speaking for a lot of ordinary Australians. â€ She is active on Facebook, as are many of her supporters. She recently announced that the majority of her press releases would be released only on Twitter.  Elle Hunt, After Indiaâ€™s prime minister announced the introduction of a new,   note last month, phones around the country lit up with the news the bill would come installed with a surveillance chip, linked to a satellite that could track the notes even 120 metres underground. The claims, debunked by the countryâ€™s reserve bank, nonetheless spread like fire over Whatsapp  â€”   which has more than 50 million users in India  â€”   and migrated into mainstream news. As in the United States and elsewhere, increasing numbers of Indians are getting their news from social media.  But the   episode illustrates the deeper impact of fake news in a country where media is prolific, but journalistic standards, especially in regional media, can still fall short.  â€œMainstream media in India is more impacted by the phenomena [of fake news] because they broadcast these kinds of stories without verifying,â€ says Prabhakar Kumar, from the Indian media research agency, CMS. â€œThere is no standard policy for TV news and newspapers about the process of researching and publishing stories. â€ Police have arrested people accused of concocting false stories, especially when they run the risk of igniting communal tension. Administrators of Whatsapp groups have been warned they could be held responsible for the messages they oversee.  But social media has only enabled a much older reliance on rumour and innuendo, especially in Indiaâ€™s villages. Two boys in Dadri village, near Delhi, didnâ€™t need Whatsapp last year to spread rumours a local man was storing beef in his freezer. They broadcast from the loudspeaker at the village temple. Mohammed Akhlaq, the    labourer named by the boys, was lynched.

politifact14908,http://www.someonesbones.com/blog/delta-force-raids-obama-stronghold-in-thailand/,Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand,"Itâ€™s hard to believe that Dave Chappelle hasnâ€™t hosted Saturday Night Live before. It seems impossible that someone who has influenced comedy like he has would have never received a   moment like that. Then again, Chappelle made himself scarce in the years after walking away from his massive hit series Chappelleâ€™s Show. Plus, SNL  â€”   though the launching pad for Eddie Murphyâ€™s meteoric rise to superstardom  â€”   has rarely been amenable to the talents of black comedians. That Chappelle is choosing this as his major comeback vehicle (and bringing A Tribe Called Quest along with him) is significant, especially at a time when itâ€™s fair to wonder where black comedy is headed in the second half of the decade. Iâ€™ve seen Dave Chappelle perform live twice: at the height of Chappelleâ€™s Showâ€™s success at a   theater in Fresno, California, and this year, in Los Angeles, on the eve of the Academy awards. The latter show took place inside a Latin dance club near Echo Park. We were made to hand over our cellphones so as not to spoil a raucous evening that included guest appearances by Oscar host Chris Rock (testing out material for his Oscar hosting gig) and Christopher â€œKidâ€ Reid from Kid â€˜n Play. That Fresno show was tight, controlled and traditional. The LA show included a running gag about orgasming, lots of cigarettes and the occasional blunt. It was a    monologue that would be familiar to anyone whoâ€™s seen Chappelle live in the past few years  â€”   as if   Lenny Bruce didnâ€™t have to fight against censorship and could just get high on stage and ramble. That formless, meandering style lends itself to glib, controversial rhetoric like his recent comments on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the Cutting Room in New York. He called Trump â€œthe most gangsta candidate everâ€ and while acknowledging that he voted for Clinton, said that â€œsheâ€™s not right, and we all know sheâ€™s not rightâ€. Chappelleâ€™s canonical status as a comic allows him these sorts of indulgences and I canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t enjoy myself, but I canâ€™t help but yearn for the focused, hungry Chappelle who I worshipped as a young adult. As an awkward biracial kid in a small town, Chappelle was the first black comic I could relate to. He straddled the line between worlds in a way that even Eddie Murphy couldnâ€™t. Chappelle was vulnerable before white comics like Louis CK and Marc Maron made that cool, and well before black standups like Hannibal Buress and W Kamau Bell could get away with it. But he was never patronizing or disinterested in his own blackness the way Bill Cosby could be. Historically, black comedy has been about bravado, about decibel levels, and about playing to the crowd  â€”   Murphyâ€™s swagger in Raw and Delirious, Richard Pryorâ€™s bare emotional intensity and confidence, Redd Foxxâ€™s bawdy misanthropy, and Bernie Macâ€™s grumpy old man ferocity. Itâ€™s a tradition typified by Def Comedy Jam, the Russell Simmons institution thatâ€™s returning to TV this weekend, the same night that Chappelle hosts SNL. The special, All Def Comedy, is a revival of sorts for the Def Comedy brand and a spinoff of a digital series produced by Simmonsâ€™s All Def Digital   brand. Looking at the lineup it seems that black comedy hasnâ€™t changed much since Chappelle went home. All Def is hosted by Chris Rockâ€™s brother Tony, a fixture at LAâ€™s Laugh Factory and the   MC for shows like this. Tony also hosted the   Showtime at the Apollo revival, Apollo Live on BET. A glance at some of the YouTube clips of the listed performers reveals common themes that run through the history of black standup: the inscrutability of black women, infidelity, the great mysteries of the bowel movement and the trials and tribulations of being broke. The supremely confident, strong black comic is personified today by people like Kevin Hart, arguably the biggest comedy star in the country today  â€”   at least in terms of his ability to consistently draw fans to movie theaters, football stadiums and various home media devices. Thereâ€™s certainly   in Hartâ€™s work: his persona is that of someone who projects authority and   but constantly subverts that image. Itâ€™s a deft modernization of the black comic standard. Thereâ€™s also SNL cast member Leslie Jones, who derives many of her laughs from her booming voice and unshakeable belief in herself, a character trait that became invaluable during her recent struggles with Twitter trolls and the  . But that was never Chappelle. From the conceptual absurdity of his   baby bit to the laconic stoner humor of   Chappelle never seemed to embrace the theatrics of Rock or Murphy (and their descendent, Hart). His crackly voice and lanky frame didnâ€™t lend themselves to the gravitas of those people. His tendency to crack up or appear mystified by his own jokes (signified by a habit of slapping his microphone on his thigh) was endearing, not intimidating. His inviting,   persona might have opened the door for the complicated response to Chappelleâ€™s Show that drove him away from the spotlight. A recent piece in The Fader by Amos Barshad looked back at the sketch that pushed Chappelle away  â€”   a racially charged bit of satire that a white audience member enjoyed way too much for his liking. Without the air of menace, the sex appeal, or authority that Rock, Murphy, Pryor, Foxx and others brought to their work, Chappelle might have made the jokes we all tell ourselves in the barber shops or basketball courts acceptable to white folks  â€”   putting black pain on a Hot Topic  . That he walked away says more about his intelligence and keen sense of empathy than anything else in his body of work. He couldnâ€™t stand to profit from work he didnâ€™t believe in, which is not necessarily true of many of his peers in black comedy. After all, Robert Townsend directed BAPS and Bill Bellamy was in whatever this was supposed to be. The influence of Chappelle is felt in comics such as Buress, the Lucas Brothers, Wyatt Cenac, Eric Andre and others  â€”   acts that donâ€™t struggle to appeal to white audiences and donâ€™t really fit in the baroque Def Jam mold. Black comedy today is seeing the same sort of divide between   and club comics that fundamentally altered the white comic landscape in the 1990s and 2000s. Chappelle could do both and based on the diverse makeup of the tiny club show I saw, he still can. The thing is, the Def Jam comic will always be a necessary part of the black cultural experience. He or she is a conduit for our frustrations, an avatar of strength in the face of rampant prejudice, and a keen observer of a world most people donâ€™t understand. Theyâ€™re also, to borrow a phrase, for us and by us in a society dominated by whiteness as status quo. Chappelle might have retreated from the siren song of the mainstream because they didnâ€™t really understand him (or even care to) but hopefully what we will see on Saturday night is a reminder of how

politifact14421,http://www.rearfront.com/about-us/, accessed Aug 11,"Investigators have begun examining the black box flight recorders of an EgyptAir plane that crashed into the Mediterranean in May, hoping to establish the cause of the disaster. The Airbus A320 flight MS804 from Paris to Cairo disappeared from radar screens between the Greek island of Crete and the north coast of Egypt on 19 May.   people were on board. A vast search operation was launched, finding debris and pieces of the planeâ€™s fuselage at the bottom of the Mediterranean, before the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered last week. The   investigative committee began examining the black boxes on Saturday in the presence of representatives from France and the United States, where the engine was made, said Egyptâ€™s civil aviation authority. Both of the devices were damaged and had to be raised from the seabed in several stages, said the authority. Their memory units were removed at the civil aviation ministryâ€™s labs in Cairo and were undergoing testing, it said. The data on them is to be unloaded, before it is analysed in a procedure that is expected to last several weeks. If badly damaged, the black boxes would be sent abroad for repairs, otherwise the work could be done in Egypt. Investigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the plane to crash, although a terror attack has not been ruled out. Franceâ€™s aviation safety agency has said the aircraft transmitted automated messages indicating smoke in the cabin and a fault in the flight control unit minutes before it disappeared. On Monday, Egyptian investigators confirmed the aircraft had made a   left turn followed by a   turn to the right before hitting the sea. The passengers on the plane were 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians, and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. They included a boy and two babies. Seven crew and three security personnel were also on board. The crash came after the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egyptâ€™s restive Sinai Peninsula last October that killed all 224 people on board.",393,648,"3098926570	19843856888	99188239813984256	127044492984455168	203868540430856192	493934262475702274	498756284410114048	512519038569041921	630971069504036864	766934490333614080	770282057629073408	896012157682204672	903490825413206017",fake
politifact14759,https://www.duffelblog.com/2017/10/bowe-bergdahl-wanders-off-court-martial/,Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial — Duffel Blog,"After last weekâ€™s wave of tragic attacks in Germany, Boris Johnson was criticised for publicly speculating that Islamist extremism was behind the shooting in Munich. While our new foreign secretaryâ€™s comments may have been inappropriate   and wrong   his brain, like most peopleâ€™s, was subject to an overwhelming impulse to find a possible motivation for an action as soon as it occurs. Our desire to understand the motivations of a killer involves a particular part of the brain called the â€˜  junctionâ€™. Also known as the â€˜mindreadingâ€™ area of the brain, it automatically ascribes possible incentives, beliefs and desires to others. This reflex developed to help us socialise, but is so powerful that we also apply it to inanimate objects such as computers, shouting, â€˜Why are you doing this to me?â€™ as they crash yet again. Even a pair of triangles can appear to exhibit personal motivations, as proved by a psychological test called the   animation.

But as genre fans are well aware, itâ€™s also long been a haven for the best horror films the industry has to offer. Recent spooky sensations to have premiered at Sundance include The Babadook, Jennifer Kentâ€™s powerhouse debut, which defied genre conventions to win a slew of awards and land on countless top 10 lists in 2014 and Robert Eggersâ€™ eerie period thriller The Witch, which is bound to do solid business when it opens in late February, just over a year after winning the festivalâ€™s best director award. (The Guardianâ€™s Jordan Hoffmann praised The Witch in his   Sundance review, writing that â€œits focus on themes over plot is what elevates it to something near greatness. â€) This yearâ€™s unarguable horror standout was Under the Shadow, the   debut of Iranian director Babak Anvari. The     film arrived in Park City with a Netflix streaming deal already in place it will also be screened in cinemas. Set in Tehran in 1988, at the height of the   war, when Iraqi bombs pelted down, Under the Shadow centers on mother Shideh (Narges Rashdi in a   performance) who is forced to care for her young daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) after Shidehâ€™s husband is ordered off to battle. The film doesnâ€™t announce itself as a horror until some distance in, when Dorsa begins alluding to a demonic presence that haunts her. Up until that point, Under the Shadow spends its time building up Shideh as a fully formed character at odds with her surroundings, so that when the terror hits, it means something. Anvariâ€™s debut is bracingly feminist in tone, with Shideh leading the charge as an aspiring doctor determined to resume her medical studies, but unable to in Iran due to her past political activism. Her husband, himself a doctor, canâ€™t bring himself to understand his wifeâ€™s longing to forge a career for herself, saying during a heated argument that sheâ€™s trying to fulfill her motherâ€™s dream  â€”   not her own. â€œDead people canâ€™t dream,â€ she solemnly retorts.  The filmâ€™s triumph lies in its ability to critique Iranâ€™s   regime for its blatant sexism (in one harrowing sequence, Shideh is arrested for simply going outdoors without her chador) while still working as a   horror when the demons come out to play. Anvari proves himself to be a master at modulating fear: the jump scares are executed with effective precision, leading up to a magnificently intense climax.  Under its scares, Under the Shadow serves as an impassioned allegory for female oppression  â€”   but Anvari doesnâ€™t shortchange horror fans. He delivers an entertainment thatâ€™s fun to watch, and subversively incisive for those willing to read between the lines.",980,79,"1013878187703627782	1013886161683611648	1013905163478847488	1013905639549161472	1013915154046566400	1013925192920334338	1013942127963885568	1013943220580036608	1013965849051492352	1013965958749347841	1013967265698590726	1013968191050145792	1013991557396131840	1013992434223779840	1014013694072803328	1014016807886344192	1014043334141202432	1014068380607959040	1014075826470576128	1014097533457584129	1014125074843136000	1014125242506084352	1014126240457023493	1014127306489630721	1014128214464135169	1014130801041203200	1014131525464584192	1014134344733134848	1014134718391087104	1014135073338216449	1014137048104488961	1014138222866255875	1014138446900801537	1014143332245803009	1014144132963397632	1014146538090696707	1014147771870400512	1014150402395328512	1014150723783671809	1014153028339986437	1014153501579063296	1014153939351228417	1014154130749734912	1014155852620685312	1014161920994238465	1014161961146298368	1014163328967602181	1014168534606176257	1014170007020941313	1014170354363711489	1014170427952975873	1014172134380273664	1014176552827998208	1014178116040871939	1014183553372999680	1014185688101785602	1014200303485366272	1014202810957815808	1014207204675805184	1014209595592626176	1014211163700150272	1014224189623033856	1014229810271440897	1014232631041576961	1014233521592954880	1014258964220010496	1014274556918485001	1014282584237465600	1014307554468474880	1014310195953102848	1014325804241743873	1014333926620397568	1014340349987352576	1014341914995326976	1014346287741915136	1014347341179080704	1014353141767294976	1014394882780262400	1014403791918063616	1014447520095789057	1014460470114377728	1014641438137700352	1014691284441862144	1014766647259918336	1014796385185607681	1014858302595981312	1014999765224837121	1015076071782350849	1015082648178446337	1015222108324970496	1015936614579802113	1016890912042037249	1023671013610020864	1030065705826312195	1030065834281103360",fake

The official Twitter account for PokÃ©mon Go tweeted that it was working hard to roll out the game in South Americaâ€™s largest country and told fans to â€œstay tunedâ€.  A representative for Niantic, which developed PokÃ©mon Go for mobile devices, declined to comment on the exact timing of the gameâ€™s release in Brazil. Japanâ€™s Nintendo owns 32% of the PokÃ©mon Company, which owns PokÃ©monâ€™s intellectual property. Some in Brazil have questioned how PokÃ©mon Go players will stay safe. Robbers in other countries have targeted distracted mobile phone players, and Brazilâ€™s steepest economic recession since the 1930s has been stoking crime and straining public finances. There have been threats of police strikes on the eve of the Games.  In the United States, some players have been drawn down dark alleys and into dangerous neighborhoods in search of the imaginary creatures, only to be targeted by criminals. Players have also been involved in car accidents.  The game can work anywhere in the world using GPS, but it is not officially available for download by local users in Brazil.  Athletes who have arrived at the Olympic village have expressed disappointment about the game not being widely available. US diver Abby Johnston tweeted on 26 July that the worst thing about the Olympic village was she could not play the game.  PokÃ©mon Go is available in 35 countries. Players use their mobile devices to search various   locations in hopes of finding and capturing virtual PokÃ©mon characters such as cuddly yellow Pikachu.  The game marries a classic    Nintendo franchise with augmented reality and has surged on Appleâ€™s app charts since its release last month. It is on its way to becoming the first mobile game to break the $   barrier, beating Candy Crush Saga.  Japanese gymnast Kohei Uchimura landed a nearly $5, 000 phone bill in Rio this week, after he was persuaded by his   to download the game shortly after touching down in Brazil for a   training camp last week.  There will be about 10, 500 athletes competing in the Olympics from 5 to 21 August in Rio, plus 5, 000 coaches and team officials.",49,999,8.69E+17,fake
politifact15141,https://nowtrump.com/2018/03/breaking-supreme-court-sides-with-trump-this-changes-everything/,BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything!,"A    landscape painting once valued at $10m and signed â€œPete Doigeâ€ was not made by the artist Peter Doig, a Chicago federal court ruled on Tuesday. Doig had been sued by a former Canadian corrections officer who claimed the artist was falsely denying that he had made the work. The unusual authentication lawsuit was filed in 2013 after the Scottish artist refused to authenticate the painting when the former corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, and art dealer Peter Bartlow tried to sell it. It required Doig to prove he hadnâ€™t painted the work. â€œI feel a living artist should be the one who gets to say yea or nay and not be taken to task and forced to go back 40 years in time. It was painstaking to piece this together,â€ he said during the ruling, according to the New York Times. Fletcher claimed he and Doig had met at Lakehead University in the 1970s. In 1976, he said he bought the work for $100 from the artist while he was incarcerated at the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre, where Fletcher worked. He said he watched Doig paint the desert landscape, fell in love with it, and purchased it to stop the young man, who had been incarcerated on an LSD charge, from going back to selling drugs. Years later, a friend noticed the painting and suggested that it could have been created by Doig, according to Fletcherâ€™s lawsuit. From there, Fletcher began working with Bartlow, who owns an art gallery in Chicago and is now a   in the case. In the trial, Fletcher and Bartlow attempted to show similarities between the painting and Doigâ€™s other works as evidence. They also claimed his denial was the product of embarrassment over the incarceration or past drug use. Doig, however, said he had never attended the university and had never been incarcerated, citing his school yearbook, his motherâ€™s letters about his whereabouts  â€”   including his role in Romeo and Juliet in high school  â€”   and written testimony from friends as evidence, the New York Times reported. He wrote in court papers that he hadnâ€™t begun to paint on canvas until late 1979. â€œIf I had painted that painting when I was 16, I would admit it,â€ he wrote. Born in Edinburgh in 1959, Doig lived in Trinidad with his family before moving with them to Canada in 1966. He studied art in London on and off between 1979 and 1990. His magical landscape paintings have earned millions  â€”   last year, Swamped, a painting of a moonlit white canoe, sold at action for nearly $26m. Fletcher and Bartlow sought $5m in damages and a declaration that the painting was authentic, since its sale was likely to earn them millions, based on recent sales of Doigâ€™s work. The artistâ€™s lawyers said they identified the real Pete Doige, whose records matched Fletcherâ€™s description. Doige died in 2012, but his sister, Marilyn Doige Bovard, testified at the trial that the work was created by her late brother. In a written statement after the verdict, Doig said of the   trial that â€œjustice prevailed, but it was way too long in comingâ€ according to the BBC. â€œThat a living artist has to defend the

The Carnegie Deli in midtown Manhattan, a legendary business in the city and just steps away from the renowned, eponymous concert hall after which it is named, will serve its last pastrami on rye on New Yearâ€™s Eve, after more than 80 years. As regulars and tourists lined up in high emotion for hours this week to savor one last bowl of matzo ball soup or helping of latkes, the young boss of its downtown fellow icon, Katzâ€™s Deli, has marked its imminent loss. â€œThe Carnegie Deli will shut its doors for the last time on December 31 and we New Yorkers have already started mourning,â€ wrote Jake Dell in a letter to the New York Times published on Thursday. Dell owns the internationally renowned Katzâ€™s in Manhattanâ€™s Lower East Side neighborhood. The corner establishment is almost 120 years old and famous for its signs exhorting wartime families to â€œsend a salami to your boy in the armyâ€ its cameo in the film When Harry Met Sally, a confusing ticketing system and epic Jewish food staples served in   surroundings. â€œI am deeply saddened to witness the disappearance of a fellow culinary landmark,â€ Dell wrote about the Carnegie Deli. A little younger than Katzâ€™s, the Carnegie has long drawn the theater crowd to its spot on Seventh Avenue, not far from Times Square, where paneled walls in   dining areas are crowded with signed pictures of the stars who have enjoyed its overstuffed reuben sandwiches or slices of brisket over the years. â€œDeli is about brining   â€¦     patience   â€¦     preservation, not just of meat but of tradition,â€ Dell wrote. The nearby Stage Deli preceded Carnegie out of Midtown four years ago when it closed, and the classic Second Avenue Deli left its old East Village spot a decade ago. Meanwhile, vintage American diners are also departing the city relentlessly and now number in the couple of hundreds where they used to exceed a thousand, and the traditional neon shop signs that brighten the nights in â€œthe city that never sleepsâ€ are disappearing along with them. The Carnegie Deli had experienced a   variety of financial hurdles in recent times, from a pay dispute to a safety crackdown and even a contentious divorce among the ownership. But Katzâ€™s Dell also pointed out that while businesses cherish the bustle of New York City, they also â€œagonize over the nonstop gentrification when we lose too many of our classics   â€¦     as we wistfully watch yet another great legend fall by the waysideâ€. Celebrated chef Anthony Bourdain lists Katzâ€™s and the classic smoked fish and bagel emporium, Russ  Daughters, nearby on Houston Street, among his favorite city eateries. So Dell had a promise on Thursday â€œto deli lovers the world overâ€: he plans to open another branch in Brooklyn this spring and the original business is continuing to expand its delivery and mail order services, in addition to packing them in around the plain tables for pickles and pastrami from breakfast time to the wee hours. â€œKatzâ€™s is not going anywhere,â€ he wrote.

politifact15147,patrioticviralnews.com/articles/international-arrest-warrant-issued-for-george-soros/,International Arrest Warrant Issued for George Soros,"Taxes on sugary drinks had a banner year in the US, with six new laws passed across the US. But advocates for the preventive health measures are warning that the Trump administration could threaten or even reverse momentum. â€œI think there is going to be some battles to be fought to maintain ground and not lose ground,â€ said David Goldberg, a spokesperson for Healthy Food America (HFA) a key supporter of these taxes. In October, the World Health Organization urged all nations to consider a sugary drink tax to curb obesity, cut health care costs and increase revenue for health services. WHO has found that a 20% increase in price led to fewer people consuming sugary drinks. It said taxes would have the greatest positive impact on the young and people with low incomes. Sugary drink tax success in the US has followed momentum internationally. Several countries have introduced the taxes in recent years, including Mexico, which introduced the tax in January 2014 and the UK, which is set to introduce its sugary drink tax in 2018. When 2016 started, Berkeley, California was the only US jurisdiction with a sugary drink tax, which passed in 2014. But this year, Americans voted by referendum to institute the taxes in four cities, and city officials passed taxes in two other metropolitan areas: Philadelphia and Cook County, Illinois  â€”   a 5. 2 million person jurisdiction that includes Chicago. Now, sugary drink tax supporters see the US federal government as a threat to these developments.    Donald Trump campaigned against lobbyists, but his transition team included Michael Torrey, a lobbyist who runs a firm that helps the main soda lobby, the American Beverage Association. Torrey was tasked with helping set up the Department of Agriculture team, according to the New York Times. And in early December, Trump named fast food executive Andy Puzder as head of the labor department.  â€œWe just have to be vigilant and try to protect gains that have been made in recent years,â€ Goldberg said. â€œBut meanwhile, regardless of what the lobbyists are doing at the federal level, we think local communities will keep making progressâ€.  New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle, author of Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning) said progress on soda taxes has been outstanding, but it was difficult to predict how Trump and a   Congress would act towards public health initiatives.  â€œNobody seems very interested in public health in the group thatâ€™s coming in, but we have to wait and see  â€”   it doesnâ€™t look promising,â€ she said. â€œIf I were   Iâ€™d be in Congress right nowâ€. The beverage industry, for its part, said the success of sugar tax laws has been exaggerated.  â€œThe   advocates are going to areas that are more predisposed to taxes and I just donâ€™t see taxes sweeping the middle of the country and people in the middle of the country wanting more government intervention,â€ said Lauren Kane, an American Beverage Association spokeswoman.  She noted that the taxes won by popular vote in some of the healthiest cities in the country: Boulder, Colorado and San Francisco.  But that skepticism has not stopped the industry from spending millions of dollars to combat these local laws. The 2016 sugar tax votes were some of the most expensive ballot measures nationwide, with the American Beverage Association, spending $38m to try and defeat the measures.   tax campaigns, meanwhile, were backed by billionaire donors such as Laura and John Arnold, whose foundation donates to HFA, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who donated nearly $20m to efforts in Californiaâ€™s Bay Area.  The taxes are also being introduced after decades of falling soda sales as consumers move away from sugary drinks in favor of healthier options.  â€œThe reality is that they [the beverage industry] are facing a public that understands the increased health risks from sugar drinks and they are facing local policy makers and local community advocates who know what their communities need,â€ said Jim Oâ€™Hara, the director of health promotion policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a   that supports sugar taxes. Oâ€™Hara said local needs would outweigh national political debates about these local health laws.  â€œMr Trump will be the president of the United States,â€ Oâ€™Hara said. â€œHeâ€™s not going to be the mayor or governor in cities or states across the countyâ€.

politifact15562,http://nytiwes.com/george-h-w-bush-has-died-at-94/,George H.W. Bush has died at 94 – New York,"Saturday nightâ€™s bombing on 23rd Street in New York brought questions of experience and temperament to the fore in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, after the Republican seized on the explosion to argue the US is in peril. At a campaign rally in Colorado on Saturday night, Trump declared the explosion to have been caused by a bomb, hours before police voiced any public conclusions. â€œJust before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly whatâ€™s going on,â€ Trump said. The Trump campaign has not said whether the businessman received information privately from New York officials or was speculating without evidence. In contrast, Clinton did what most officials do after an uncertain and dangerous incident: urge caution and patience for conclusions from police. â€œI think itâ€™s important to know the facts about any incident like this,â€ she told reporters on her campaign plane. â€œThatâ€™s why itâ€™s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen.  â€œI think itâ€™s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened. â€ Two hours after Trumpâ€™s remarks, New York mayor Bill de Blasio described the bombing, which injured 29 people, as â€œan intentional actâ€. But De Blasio, NYPD commissioner James Oâ€™Neill and Governor Andrew Cuomo all stressed on Sunday that they have not found evidence so far of any link to international terrorism and are considering any suspect and motive. On Sunday afternoon, Clinton called the bombing one of three â€œapparent terrorist attacksâ€ alongside pending investigations into pipe bombs in New Jersey and a mass stabbing in Minnesota. The FBI is investigating the stabbing as a â€œpotential terrorist attackâ€ police have ascribed no motive or suspect to the pipe bombs, which officials said on Sunday had not been established to be linked to the New York explosion. â€œI pray for all of those who were wounded, and for their families,â€ Clinton said in a statement. â€œOnce again, we saw the bravery of our first responders who run toward danger to help others. Their quick actions saved lives. â€ Clinton then reiterated her outline for an   plan, including an â€œintelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacksâ€ and â€œwork with Silicon Valley to counter propagandaâ€. Both Clinton and Trumpâ€™s proposals largely mirror the   priorities of Barack Obama, who has waged a bombing campaign abroad and authorized extensive surveillance online. Tim Kaine, the Democratic   candidate, argued that his running mate has   experience in such crises. â€œHillary Clinton was New York senator on   and was there at the World Trade Centers,â€ he told NBCâ€™s Meet the Press. â€œThey were still looking for survivors. And sheâ€™s been through this. Itâ€™s been a searing experience in her life. And she was part of the national security team that worked together to revive the hunt and wipe out [Osama] bin Laden. â€œAnd so it is an important time where you have to have experience. â€ Asked if the threat of violence, whether through bombings, mass shootings or terror, was â€œa new normalâ€ Kaine said: â€œI donâ€™t accept that. We donâ€™t know yet about the cause of these incidents. But weâ€™re not allowing it to be a normal. â€ Kaine also spoke of the US campaign against Islamic State, although the terror group has not claimed responsibility for the explosion. â€œThe challenge is, as Isis realizes that theyâ€™re losing ground, then they see whether they can exploit weaknesses elsewhere,â€ he said. On Sunday Trump only acknowledged the bombing only with a tweet, writing: â€œI would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC. â€ His ally Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was markedly more cautious than the Republican nominee when asked about the bombing on Sunday. A pipe bomb exploded in the New Jersey town of Seaside on Saturday, and though police say they have found no connection between that explosion and New Yorkâ€™s, they were investigating any possible link. â€œWe donâ€™t believe at this time that there is evidence connecting it to the attacks in New York or Minnesota,â€ Christie told CNN, referring to a stabbing at a mall in St Cloud in which eight people were wounded and the suspect, who reportedly made reference to Allah, was shot dead. â€œWe have some promising leads, but no suspects at this time. â€ â€œYou donâ€™t want to jump to conclusions,â€ he added. â€œAnd you donâ€™t want to put information out there that you donâ€™t know is absolutely true. â€ But despite this admonition Christie defended Trumpâ€™s decision to describe the explosion as a bombing long before there was any evidence to do so.  â€œI think that what Donald did was perfectly appropriate to tell that group in Colorado Springs that a bomb had exploded,â€ Christie said.  â€œI donâ€™t think you have to defer when saying that there was an explosion and a bomb in New York. I mean, everybody knew that. It was being reported on television. â€ Most news networks were careful to say that police did not know the cause of the explosion at the time. Throughout his campaign, Trump has spoken of America in almost dystopian terms, describing it  â€”   often with false or misleading statements  â€”   as a â€œdivided crime sceneâ€ where refugees are a â€œTrojan horseâ€ for terrorism, police are endangered and murder and unemployment on the rise.  He has also reacted in unpredictable ways in the aftermath of horrific events, for instance after the mass shooting in Orlando in June, when he thanked people  for â€œthe congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorismâ€. Christie echoed Trumpâ€™s dark vision of the US on Sunday, and blamed Clinton and Barack Obama for it.  â€œItâ€™s because of her type of leadership over the last eight years,â€ he said, â€œalong with the president, that the world is a much more dangerous place. â€ Clinton contrasted that message in her own statement, saying: â€œAmericans have faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger. I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear.

politifact15096,https://www.apnews.com/2cce92805c2749c297d0bbc5e16e0287,Keanu on Trump travel ban: 'just terrible',"It wouldnâ€™t be surprising if, as one recent visitor to the Bush compound in Kennebunkport reports, former president George HW Bush will be voting for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump this fall. After all, the elder Bush president is a moderate from the   who has in recent years developed a close relationship with the Clintons. His old patrician sensibility is reportedly offended by Trumpâ€™s vulgar style. And letâ€™s not forget Bush witnessed Trump ruthlessly and gleefully eviscerate his son Jeb during the Republican primary, often in the most personal of ways, and delve into conspiracy theories to attack the presidential legacy of another son, George W. This is not to say that Bush voting for Clinton is a   altogether. When is the last time a former Republican president not only refused to endorse the presidential nominee of their own party but allowed it to get out they were actually voting for the opposition partyâ€™s presidential candidate? Off the top of my head, I canâ€™t think of any parallel in recent American history.  But if you forget for a moment that George HW Bush was once was a Republican president, he is not all that different from the type of Republicans who have crossed party lines in past elections to endorse the Democratic nominee. (Think Colin Powell in 2008 and 2012.) To understand why this story is more remarkable than notable Republicans crossing party lines to support, say, Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, you have to take a look of the full scope of   Republicans who have refused to endorse Trump, if not declared they will be voting for Clinton. Yes, you have the squishy   Republicans such as Bush, Maine senator Susan Collins and former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman. But you also have staunch movement conservatives like Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, Washington Post columnist George Will and radio host Erick Erickson not getting aboard the Trump train. Now, unlike Bush Sr, this latter group is probably far less likely to let it be known they support Clinton over Trump. But unlike in 2008 and 2012, there are bulwarks of the conservative movement refusing to get behind the Republican presidential nominee, not just those easily dismissed as Rinos (   ). Thatâ€™s no small thing. It is true that as the election draws nearer, some   Never Trump conservatives have come around to supporting Trump. Conservative talkshow host Mark Levin is perhaps the most famous example. But many more Never Trumpers seem to be in it for the long haul, even in the face of conservatives who argue that they have to vote for Trump at the very least to prevent Clintonâ€™s supreme court nominees. But itâ€™s not only significant   politicians, activists and opinion columnists who are refusing to support Trump. The most famous conservative academics are refusing to get behind him as well, including conservative and libertarian legal scholars  â€”   exactly the kind of people who understand how important the supreme court is. For instance, you have Princeton professor Robert P George, perhaps the most noted intellectual defender of social conservatism in the country, refusing to back Trump, even as he says he canâ€™t back Clinton either. The same goes with some of the top conservative economists, such as Harvardâ€™s Greg Mankiw. In fact, the Wall Street Journal reached out to 45 past economists who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under both Republican and Democratic administrations and not one responded to say they were supporting Trump. You can make fun of these people as egghead elitists, but the reality is most have fought the intellectual conservative fight in the most liberal of environments their entire lives. These are are not squishy moderates. They are true believers in conservative principles. So it may be easy to dismiss George HW Bushâ€™s putative decision to vote for Clinton (his spokesman refuses to confirm or deny the report). But when you look at the scope of figures  â€”   from Republican establishment politicians to leaders of the conservative movement to members of the conservative intelligentsia  â€”   who still refuse to get on the Trump train and likely never will, it is hard to conclude anything other than there is something truly repellent about the current Republican presidential nominee  â€”   and something deeply awry with a conservative movement that could nominate him.

The Porter Airlines Bombardier Q400   plane, which took off from Ottawa, was at 9, 000ft (2, 750 meters) descending into the cityâ€™s Billy Bishop waterfront airport, when the pilots saw an unmanned aerial vehicle.  â€œTwo crew members performed an evasive maneuver to avoid the unidentified object,â€ said Genevieve Corbin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). Corbin said the object was most likely a drone. Two cabin crew suffered slight injuries during the incident, Porter said.  â€œThe pilotsâ€™ initial assessment was that it looked like a balloon. After debriefing, there is potential that the object was a drone,â€ said Porter Airlines spokesman Brad Cicero.   The plane landed at about 7. 30am ET (12. 30 GMT). The TSB has now launched an investigation, the first time it has done so for such an incident, said Corbin.   In June, Canadaâ€™s federal transport ministry launched a campaign intended to deter people from flying drones near airports or aircraft.   There have been a rash of   between planes and unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States in recent years.   In April, police in Britain said a British Airways passenger aircraft collided with what was most likely a drone as it prepared to land at Londonâ€™s Heathrow airport. The aircraft landed safely and no injuries were reported in the incident.  ",379,948,9.91E+17,fake
politifact14884,empirenews.net/police-discover-meth-lab-in-back-room-of-alabama-walmart/,Police Discover Meth Lab In Back Room of Alabama Walmart,"Facebook is looking for an experienced media executive to help smooth its relationship with the press amid mounting concerns about fake news and the social networkâ€™s influence over the public. On Monday the company began advertising for a head of news partnerships with â€œ20+ years of experience in news, with strong   and understanding across the businessâ€. The requirement means those applying must have started their news career before Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had celebrated his 13th birthday. The applicant will also be expected to be the â€œ  voice of Facebook and its role in the news ecosystemâ€ and â€œa strong voice within Facebook on the goals and priorities of news publishersâ€. The company already has a director of global media partnerships, Andy Mitchell, who has a background on the business side of news organisations, mainly with CNN. It has also employed former journalists in less senior roles. But the latest job ad suggests the company is looking for someone to address concerns raised by media organisations, politicians and others about the social networkâ€™s wider impact. Fake news stories concerning the US election, in particular favouring Donald Trump, have been blamed by some for influencing voters and has pushed Facebookâ€™s role into the spotlight.  The company has also come under scrutiny for removing the famous photograph of a girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam war, manually editing its trending results, and attracting the lionâ€™s share of mobile advertising revenues which many media organisations are competing for. The wording of the head of news job posting stops far short of suggesting Facebook is looking for someone to explicitly operate as an editor, something many in the industry have suggested is necessary but that the company has vigorously resisted. Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied that fake news on Facebook could have influenced the results of the US election, and while he has said the company would take steps to tackle the problem, he has warned that it should not be â€œarbiters of truth ourselvesâ€.

So dominant has Isis become in the realm of jihadist lore, that you could be forgiven for thinking that its precursor has been relegated to a mere footnote. Youâ€™d be wrong. Those three deaths, all in US airstrikes, paradoxically hint at a resurgence of   at a time when Isis is in retreat in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Quietly, and more through soft power rather than harsh atrocity,   is trying to mount a revival.  The Pentagon said that at least one of the three leaders killed, Haydar Kirkan, a   veteran of the group, had been actively planning attacks against the west at the time of his death. This is a controversial claim as   founded in 1988, has in recent years foresworn such   operations in favour of a strategy privileging a slow and steady building of influence and capability at a local level within the Islamic world.  In part, this decision  â€”   taken by Ayman   the leader of   shortly after he succeeded the late Osama bin Laden in 2011  â€”   was forced on the group by its weakness after years of being targeted by the US and allies in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001.  But more recently it has been a deliberate attempt to distance it from Isis, which has been responsible for directly organised strikes in France, Belgium, Germany and Tunisia, among others, and  â€”   through   â€œlone wolvesâ€  â€”   in the US.    and its affiliates have deliberately shunned the savagery of Isis, seeking to build support across the Islamic world through outreach to tribal leaders, power brokers and sometimes the broader community, rather than outright fear and coercion.  The group does not seek publicity. â€œ â€™s strategic experience is that if it makes a big deal of seizing territory, it attracts CT [ ] resources, so it is simply not being as loud about it,â€ said Daveed   an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, a US thinktank. The three locations of the US strikes two months ago are significant. Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria are all key strategic zones where Isis has either failed to make significant advances or, in the latter case, is on the retreat.  In January 2015, Isis formally announced the establishment of what it called Khorasan province in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The move, coupled with an attempt to expand in Bangladesh, signified a push to branch out into south Asia and win recruits among the more than 400 million Muslims in the region. But the militants have had little success. â€œDespite its best efforts   â€¦     the Islamic State controls little territory in south Asia, [has] conducted only a handful of attacks, failed to secure the support of most locals, and struggled with poor leadership,â€ wrote Seth Jones, a former adviser to US forces in Afghanistan, this month. A major obstacle to the expansion of Isis in the region has been the opposition of most local militant groups, notably the Taliban.    which has preserved a close relationship with the Taliban and some other militant groups, is still present in Afghanistan. In October 2015, US and Afghan forces attacked a huge training compound in the south of the country, killing more than 200 militants. The camp was used by   in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) an affiliate established in 2014. South Asian officials point out that AQIS has so far failed to carry out any significant attacks or attract large numbers of recruits. However, that   had survived at all in the region was â€œimpressiveâ€ one said.  â€œThereâ€™s been constant pressure on the group, and particularly its leadership element, for 15 years, and theyâ€™re still there. The death of   is a blow, but theyâ€™ve suffered worse and still come back,â€ said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Another key battlefield has been Yemen, where, in perhaps the most striking unintended consequence of the   military intervention in the country,   was able to run a   on Yemenâ€™s coast for many months.  The substantial and strategically situated port city of Mukalla provided the group with a revenue of an estimated $2m a day. A 2015 US government report estimated that   in the Arabian peninsula (AQAP) the   affiliate, could muster at least 4, 000 fighters, four times the total a year previously. The group has also built ties with southern Yemenis, who have felt marginalised by the countryâ€™s northern elite for years. â€œWe may be facing a more complicated   not just a terrorist organisation, but a movement controlling territory with happy people inside it,â€ said a regional diplomat who follows Yemen.     has also successfully expanded its presence in Africa. The violence and brutality associated with the   Boko Haram group, which has now split over its nominal allegiance to Isis, and the Isis expansion into Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, have overshadowed the less spectacular but arguably more effective efforts made by   affiliates on the continent.  In Somalia, commanders of the   movement ruthlessly eliminated   factions that wanted to repudiate the groupâ€™s    allegiance to  . A last dissident group is currently under siege from Somali forces in the far north of Somalia, in   Puntland, and facing annihilation.  In the Sahel, although one new faction has emerged to launch attacks in the name of Isis, it is the coalition of factions that form   in the Maghreb (AQIM) that is dominant.   AQIM has exploited deep ties  â€”   some through marriage  â€”   with local communities and levered ethnic disputes to gain support and capabilities in Mali, a key state that French and other international forces have been unable to rid of extremists. â€œ  is on a trajectory to become by far the most powerful jihadist movement in Africa,â€ said  .  The most significant theatre may well turn out to be the Levant. Though most analysts believe Isis will remain a powerful  â€”   even if fragmented  â€”   force in the region for years to come,   may be the biggest winner.  The key to its strategy has been the   group now called Jabhat Fateh   (JFS). Formerly known as   Front, the powerful faction was rebranded in late July as a force without links to the global jihadi struggle but dedicated only to fighting Bashar  â€™s regime and its allies.  In recent years,   has repeatedly attempted to downplay its links to local groups to avoid alienating communities which do not want to be part of a â€œglobal jihadâ€ but which hope Islamic hardliners might impose order and honest, if rigorous, administration in areas they control.   Western officials fear JFS will not only dominate the jihadi landscape in the Levant following the defeat of Isis, but may also provide a springboard for   to launch strikes into Europe, should the group change its current strategy. Zawahiri has made it clear that although the group may have prioritised local campaigns for the moment, it still remains committed to attacks on the west in the long term. â€œAs the Islamic State continues to lose territory and as the international coalition continues targeted airstrikes, we are likely to see another name in the headlines more often: Jabhat Fateh â€ said Matthew Henman, of Janeâ€™s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. Hoffman described JFS as â€œeven more capable than the Islamic State and a more dangerous   threatâ€.",128,941,"440521684668260352	440521695351164928	440521704255676416	440523970308079617	440524106979901441	440525233745719297	440525377669058560	440532834793431041	440538098104291328	440541431103385600	440541672766599168	440547235278127104	440550290521997312	440553158729662464	440555765921615873	440561587749806080	440562150403481601	440570338082971648	440570335528615936	440570343351017472	440570340603744258	440570563493244928	440570626953064448	440595011856392192	440598755583459329	440636962006134784	440642005832441857	440654376882159616	440782452748206080	440873765652545536	440893765692432384	440927638920888320	441044049751838720	592483555520970752	620489358299254784	670286376437444608	699960569294692352	974783292523368450	974846135209742337	974899266920558592	974954316237819904	974954865167339520	974960203312566272	974968288613732353	974968635004522499	974968762016436224	974968781209571328	974974920571711493	974978706035871744	974985430268567554	974990307447267328	974997351143231488	975007398548131841	975007766103384069	975008281017004033	975008412416335872	975008476635295744	975009057844023297	975009059618222082	975009074826874880	975009091314597890	975010250230247424	975011587634487296	975012199361142784	975014170025517057	975014250392498176	975014624394432513	975014635953967104	975015007694962688	975023079935102976	975028620405166080	975031017689026561	975032269583757312	975044021017104384	975049995668873218	975066987733889024	975075750024904704	975089707167174657	975089706936434689	975098568930406406	975115324784717826	975121614844002304	975122149739343873	975126712412450816	975131859641184257	975140412154195968	975164427988291584	975166805521002496	975167866591948800	975171750844600321	975183044805124096	975188846769000448	975188975588663297	975246846737113089	975246849031340032	975265841641086976	975265979113660418	975299573278224384	975347612353167361	975354070272823297	975369493454127110	975372653614727169	975392048017739776	975398362764767234	975428983444688898	975433390290694144	975442039901913088	975520011669458944	975564857721356288	975749190537109505	975767426502709248	975771524174090243	975773512899145728	975774251272867841	975781919546920961	975783594881900545	975784515011579904	975784999768264704	975785611373228033	975798929403953152	975798929223598084	975800323653734400	975801581068173312	975807626943647744	975807654776987650	975807994830245888	975809831104925697	975813468346638336	975814342020075521	975815051830579200	975815659413295104	975817974463565824	975818111449518080	975820549132832768	975825911043026944	975830026116415489	975830730059100161	975830944203624451	975832250238447617	975833234347999233	975833304153780224	975834307586650118	975838148377882624	975840331508998144	975842658047307776	975844342999986176	975849599633117185	975854906597957634	975859618084667393	975860908349108224	975864749773770753	975865890293022725	975867317463732224	975877361035038720	975880927976050693	975881134855868416	975882960275636229	975887070152491008	975892232355139584	975892317868523521	975893255505276928	975894044680359936	975894075143606277	975914441735798784	975915290885226496	975919662612480000	975921082573250560	975928895173259265	975942449775378432	975962343254392833	976049259677126657	976051584579899393	976065430929510401	976075089400811520	976088124584538112	976095224551428096	976095711182905346	976115777626673157	976121501987540992	976134426882174977	976134465079607296	976139458398564352	976142478817579013	976144492343562245	976146953577877504	976155385655541760	976166453417316354	976167861239590917	976168007771787265	976172121297686534	976174702208143360	976182757369016320	976183469414993922	976185379941421056	976188722348773376	976197114299600902	976222668830773248	976240689049718784	976270341835251712	976290718753857536	976424801551159297	976424805279911936	976424810933874688	976441739882921984	976454101713281027	976486189996888065	976504123091689473	976504572607959041	976532228200116225	976569676129030145	976582591888359425	976609002678378496	976620250425970690	976642963550949376	976768967036620800	976836591166648320	977058455868596224	977209490725629955	977212457105219584	977213203762634752	977214666656141313	977228142313172995	977229338750963714	977229521798746113	977230154941509632	977231099536527361	977243745233113094	977246384234512384	977250144482615296	977251599260110851	977252875641405440	977255589263892488	977255631294992384	977256570579959808	977257013997654016	977258203246481409	977271288073990145	977272533916495872	977273790735568898	977288593579302913	977289139023380480	977290074193842178	977292839397871617	977317582414884867	977321867143860224	977337791779520512	977345374120636416	977347520345997312	977375474484695046	977379851979149320	977397570875076608	977404025674100737	977525064425000961	977545537321865218	977561244826783746	977647895724752896	977674655451500547	977699352473825280	977734583151022081	977735680548892672	977741614821949440	977752188565929984	9

The extent of their raucous boozing and debauchery is being carefully catalogued inside the newly opened Nan A Rothschild Research Center, a repository in midtown Manhattan housing over one million archaeological artifacts from New York Cityâ€™s past. On a recent Thursday morning, Amanda Sutphin, the director of archaeology for the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission, sorted through some of her favorite City Hall party relics. She picked up a smooth, cylindrical object the size of stubby Cuban cigar. â€œTake a look at this douche,â€ said Sutphin, who is tall, with glasses and a short brown bob. â€œItâ€™s made of cow bone though, so it might have felt a bit rough. â€  The park behind City Hall, which was built in 1812, is by far the repositoryâ€™s largest haul  â€”   the city has collected over 400 boxes of artifacts from the site. A lot of them seem to be liquor bottles. â€œWhenever someone important would come to the city  â€”   like, say, Marquis de Lafayette  â€”   they would always throw a giant party. â€ Sutphin paused, still holding the douche. â€œBut Iâ€™m not saying this douche was found at Lafayetteâ€™s party!â€ The douche was uncovered in 2011, and caused enough of a stir that it was featured on a Saturday Night Live skit some years ago. â€œIt was just like, â€˜They found a douche behind City Hall, ooooo  â€¦    â€ A pause. â€œI never said it was funny. â€  Originally, no one could work out what it was  â€”   the archaeologist who found it thought it was a pepper grinder. â€œBut you can see here,â€  â€”   Sutphin unscrewed the top  â€”   â€œitâ€™s got a little plunger. And on the ends you can see the small holes. â€ It probably belonged to a young woman from the middle class  â€”   a more    society lady would have had a glass douche. â€œFor a smoother experience,â€ Sutphin said. Some women even used theirs as contraception, although, as Sutphin noted, â€œProbably wasnâ€™t very effective. â€ The repository is a small,   room in the basement of a Durst Organization building on West 47th Street. There are about 1, 5000 cardboard boxes  â€”   â€œarchival boxesâ€ is the technical term  â€”   filled with artifacts from 14 sites across the five boroughs, stacked neatly on white shelves. There are a lot of ceramics from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, remnants of the Revolutionary war (bayonets and buttons made by soldiers when it was too cold to go outside) and a lot of evidence of what people used to eat: bones  â€”   both cow and dog  â€”   and oysters as large as saucepans. This is because New York harbor in the 18th century was home to one of the largest oyster beds in the world the street carts that now sell hotdogs used to sell oysters in all varieties: raw, pickled, fried. â€œHaving an oyster back then would have been like having a nice steak,â€ Sutphin said.  Sutphin studied at Barnard College and has been with the Commission for 20 years. Her job is to review development projects happening throughout the city and figure out if there are any potential archaeological treasures to be found. â€œYou need to have a good grasp on the cityâ€™s history, particularly things like knowing where the early settlements were, what was farmland and what wasnâ€™t  â€”   and most importantly, where people dumped their trash. â€ The most common archaeological sites in the city are 19th century privies  â€”   toilets, in other words. Before New York City had public water, people used outhouses, with a separate cistern to store water. When public water was introduced, people began filling their outhouses with household trash. For Sutphin, colonial lavatories are about as exciting as it gets. â€œItâ€™s a time capsule of what that period is like. Sometimes you find incredible things: peopleâ€™s old dishes, their secret liquor stash. â€ Sutphinâ€™s job is rare: only a handful of other major US cities have archaeology programs, Boston and DC among them. â€œA lot of people think itâ€™s like Indiana Jones,â€ Sutphin said, somewhat annoyed. â€œItâ€™s not about finding some cool thing from the past that has magic powers  â€”   itâ€™s trying to recreate a puzzle of what the past was like. â€  Next to the City Hall party items, Sutphin had assembled a selection of the collectionâ€™s quirkier items: burned coffee beans  â€”   â€œCoffee was as important in the 19th century as it is now. Everyone drank it because the water was kind of shit back thenâ€  â€”   a femur from a passenger pigeon, which once ruled the skies above New York before being hunted into extinction some 100 years ago  â€”   â€œThey had bright, pretty feathers so everyone wanted someâ€  â€”   and a tea cup set belonging to the Van Cortlands, a wealthy family from the Bronx. Coincidentally, some of the items in the repository were until very recently stored inside the womenâ€™s restroom in Van Cortland park. â€œI do not know why or how the decision was made to store the collections there  â€”   but it was made many years ago and I think clearly shows the need for the repository both as a climate controlled facility and as a place that is managed by people who understand the importance of the collections,â€ Sutphin said. The only item in the collection associated with a particular individual is a wine jug seal belonging to Benjamin Fletcher, who was governor of New York from 1692 to 1697. (It was normal for wealthy people to send their own fancy glass jugs to taverns to be filled with wine.) Fletcher was a notorious lover of pirates, to the point where he allowed them safe passage in New York and as a result, was swiftly fired from his post and sent back to London, where he faced charges of conspiracy and bribery. â€œHe was a naughty boy,â€ Sutphin conceded. Although the repository is only open to researches and scholars, the Commission recently launched an online digital archive, where anyone can view images of the collection and read up on each artifactâ€™s backstory. Admittedly, these descriptions arenâ€™t very imaginative. â€œNuremberg single wire spectacles, small pieces of copper alloy wire tying the circular loops closed, probably Klemmerâ€™s clip, glass lenses missing. â€ In real life, the spectacles look like theyâ€™ve seen better days. Sutphin pulled them out of their box to show me. â€œI donâ€™t know how effective these would have been  â€”   maybe more effective than the douche?â€  She started to laugh, but stopped abruptly. â€œBut seriously,â€ she said, leaning in closer. â€œThe more stories we understand about our city the more people are represented, the richer we all are. Itâ€™s very much an   Trump view. â€",780,105,"951504146078879744	952159669006622721	952165544819609600	952192884505133056	952617369876115456	980684201421713409	990653084278906881	992580993969246209	1008120728171024385	1011236647923568641	1014288260523229184	1016920115789561856	1016920114464284673",fake

The game had begun under a barely concealed layer of concern over strikes and security fears, exacerbated by news of skirmishes involving England fans in Marseille, but Didier Deschampsâ€™s young France team eventually achieved   with a   victory over a dogged Romania. Afterwards, Payet said he had felt â€œa lot of stress, a lot of pressureâ€. â€œIf someone had told me it would have gone like that I wouldnâ€™t have believed it,â€ added the West Ham United forward. On the approach to the national stadium in   which was the target for three suicide bombers almost exactly seven months ago amid terrorist attacks on the capital that killed 130 people, home fans draped tricolors around their shoulders and donned novelty chicken hats, but the usual celebratory air was undercut by a mix of defiance and trepidation. Yet once inside, 75, 000 noisy fans waved thousands of French flags and a sizeable Romanian contingent responded in kind, forming a bold block of yellow at one end, as they tried to focus on the fact that a football tournament featuring 24 teams playing 51 matches across 10 stadiums was about to break out. All the accoutrements of a modern major sporting event were present and correct  â€”   the sponsorsâ€™ branding, the all but   stands, the painted faces and the garish wigs  â€”   but there was also an impatience to get under way and park the concerns of the buildup. Each new European Championship brings with it inflation  â€”   this time in its expansion to 24 teams and 2. 5 million fans  â€”   and that extended to the opening ceremony last night. DJ David Guetta, who the previous night had played a free concert for 80, 000 people under the Eiffel Tower, provided the music. French patrol planes flew overhead, 144   dancers in dresses emblazoned with the French flag cavorted around the pitch, an Eiffel Tower banner was unfurled and a 7. 5 sq km French garden overlay were all employed to try to create a party atmosphere in stark contrast to the ring of steel outside. But earlier, at least one metro train was evacuated as a precaution and the stadium was cleared in   to allow police with sniffer dogs to sweep through before the arrival of the French president, FranÃ§ois Hollande. He had also been present on the night of the attacks in November when France faced Germany, and it was when he left his seat in the VIP area that night that many of those present in the stadium knew something serious had happened. A huge security operation is under way across the country, with 90, 000 police, army and security staff responding to the heightened threat level. A security force of at least 13, 000 is on duty in the capital alone. Organisers had pleaded with fans to arrive up to three hours before   opening the gates early and promising entertainment within the stadiums, but strikes that have frustrated ministers and left rubbish piling up in central Paris also affected trains to the Stade de France. When the action on the pitch finally started, a swashbuckling France took the game to Romania but failed to puncture their gutsy defence before   as the crowd began again to get edgy.  Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud gave the hosts the lead shortly before the hour mark but Romania levelled from the penalty spot, before Payet stepped up to arrow his shot into the top corner and prompted a lusty rendition of the La Marseillaise, sung as much in relief as in triumph.",404,497,"1008393012563644416	1008396231964585984	1008418837652361216	1008419849276665858	1008432971177693186	1008453200721207296	1008483038932750336	1008495896068284421	1008519744427888640	1008519794054848512	1008532037811298305	1008538512973369344	1008541520457355269	1008545108625645569	1008563352455516160	1008566532530688000	1008581416978792450	1008615346482409473	1008677850675863552	1008712309248876544	1008722841104199681	1008727284864376832	1008766499803287553	1008817555253923841	1008832700902445062	1008841184863834114	1008846294629183488	1008846991235825664	1008892307649843200	1009036834364710914	1009118873256415237	1009119550913335296	1009122947754102784	1009160671496417284	1009253579763351555	1009255292088016898	1009266756043632641	1009271748192133120	1009278289045835776	1009357110780485632	1009391454072918017	1009519153542238208	1009522108421025794	1009525652821893122	1009527744135344128	1009528310785814531	1009540681847713793	1009548509572239360	1009548798656499712	1009549033076133889	1009550050899292160	1009576394974638086	1009589391902339074	1009589938508136448	1009593521865678848	1009594350504902657	1009595533613256707	1009598857129398272	1009627462865547265	1009640771266449408	1009655067597770752	1009656396898553857	1009656443010715648	1009656630403837955	1009657252419129344	1009657669928538112	1009666601195593728	1009667014351343616	1009669669316329472	1009670341948526593	1009670696597970945	1009671294688915457	1009671608573857793	1009980721908387841	1010222070310064130	1010789613869453315	1010836719397167104	1010991745520361476	1011456590304514049	1015952034044968961	1015953243766247424	1019835630841286656	1021105739178356736	1023082293500555264	1023238159704973317	1024086724274737152	1026512344040579078	1026520588469395457	1029780603380609024	1033399547496685572	1034650961585811456	1035592127907082244	1035914514305302528	1037093654995902464	1037347050273337345	1037393734403547137	1037511114559512577	1037553969793519616	1037557564811051008	1037744432550957056	1038832435457388544	1040095150364676096	1040295446298669056	1046777478063230978	1046798110352130049	1059868813053911040	1063713766003625984	1066886927243243522	1066888540104077312",fake

I was strolling down the street with my two young daughters. Lucy, the preschooler, was whirling around ahead of me, seemingly determined to fall on her face, while Beatrice, the baby, was squirming and giving me back strain in the baby carrier. I had not experienced a solid five hours of sleep in months. I had mastitis, so I was wearing cabbage leaves in my bra. Because I lived in a beautiful, gentrifying neighborhood that was still populated with a sprinkling of wise   I daily had some stranger approach me and sagely advise, â€œEnjoy it now. It goes by so fast. â€  But on this day, as I nodded gently in fake gratitude to the tip, I made a promise to myself. Iâ€™ll try to enjoy it, I thought. And I will never, ever say that to another parent. I will remember that it doesnâ€™t go by so fast when youâ€™ve been up since 4:30. I will remember that not all of this is very enjoyable at all. Now, that daredevil preschooler is a    high school junior with a packed social schedule. The baby who kept me up nights is a middle schooler who could, if   were an Olympic event, be a gold medalist. Sometimes I look at them and wistfully realize that they will never again fall asleep in my lap as I read them Goodnight Moon. I will never hear them hilariously mispronounce â€œelevatorâ€ or â€œambulanceâ€. I will not push them on swings, or feed them applesauce as we watch Sesame Street together. That door is closed.  I feel remarkably OK about that. Exhausted, overwhelmed parents of young children, let me assure you that, yes, this time in your childrenâ€™s lives is precious and beautiful and intimate and full of magic and discovery. But no, you do not need anybody to chide you into appreciating it. Iâ€™m sure you already do. Iâ€™m also sure you sometimes canâ€™t even imagine a barefoot walk across the living room floor that doesnâ€™t end in a   howl of pain. Iâ€™m sure the last five movies you saw involved talking animals. Iâ€™m sure the idea of a trip to the bathroom for yourself with nobody banging on the other side of the door sounds like a vacation in a four star hotel.  Well guess what? That uninterrupted bathroom break will come. And it wonâ€™t be sad. Itâ€™ll be awesome.  Recently, a friend came in from out of town for business, and do you know what we did? We met up for drinks. At 4pm. My purse has zero Cheerio dust in it. I havenâ€™t heard the Kidz Bop version of a contemporary pop song in a good three years. Sometimes, on the weekend, I sleep past 8am.  It helps very much that I happen to think my daughters have grown up to be pretty great people. They donâ€™t need me to tie their shoes, but they can make dinner. They donâ€™t make me pipe cleaner art, but they can talk about politics and movies and books theyâ€™ve read. They are interesting, engaged young women I like as individuals as much as I love them as my flesh and blood. That cuddly puppy phase of their lives was uniquely sweet, but seeing smart, independent young people launching into the world? Thatâ€™s sweet too. I think when people get inordinately nostalgic for their childrenâ€™s youths, theyâ€™re really being nostalgic for their own. Iâ€™d be lying if I said I didnâ€™t miss that young mom version of myself, the one with fewer lines on her face and flawless eyesight. I know that I associate my girlsâ€™ babyhood with a period of my own life, before a marital crisis and two bouts of cancer and the death of my best friend.  But I also remember how grateful I was when a friendâ€™s parent lovingly told me, when my kids were little: â€œThese are hard years. â€ So I try to hang on to the truth of that time, of what it was like when I couldnâ€™t just take a shower when I wanted, when an     tantrum could mean a child lying prone in the middle of the supermarket, making a spectacular scene. Sometimes when I see another parent whose kid is losing it in public, I just want to go over and reassure: â€œIt gets better. â€  There are so many joys of having older children, and of being older oneself. Believe it. Donâ€™t let anybody arrogantly make you feel like youâ€™re not stopping to smell the roses enough when youâ€™ve spent your day wiping noses instead. Iâ€™m here from your future, to tell you that it hasnâ€™t gone by too fast. It hasnâ€™t gone by at all. The story is still being told. And every chapter holds its own wonders.

But on Tuesday he suggested something even darker and more sinister: that his supporters resolve the issue with guns. Specifically, he suggested that using the constitutional right to bear arms may be the only way to stop Clinton from appointing supreme court justices should she win in November. â€œIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,â€ Trump said, before adding: â€œAlthough the second amendment people  â€”   maybe there is, I donâ€™t know. â€ Whether Trump was suggesting his supporters use their weaponry against Clinton herself or any liberal judges she might go on to appoint is somewhat open to interpretation. Most people are reading it as the former, but either way itâ€™s unacceptable and a violation of what it means to live in a free democracy. This is a new low even for Trump, whoâ€™s been accused of inciting general violence and has verbally attacked individuals from Khizr Khan to Rosie Oâ€™Donnell. But heâ€™s never seemed to incite it against individuals  â€”   until now. Gabby Giffords drove home that point and the pernicious effect those words could have on the unstable, in a statement released Tuesday. â€œWe must draw a bright red line between political speech and suggestions of violence,â€ she said. â€œResponsible, stable individuals wonâ€™t take Trumpâ€™s rhetoric to its literal end, but his words may provide a magnet for those seeking infamy. They may provide inspiration or permission for those bent on bloodshed. â€ Those words have special meaning coming from Giffords, whose time in political office was cut short by an assassination attempt that left six dead she survived but with a critical gunshot wound to the head. Now Trump is pulling the tricks he always does when he says something beyond the pale politically. Heâ€™s blaming the media for getting it wrong. Before when heâ€™s implicitly encouraged or used the language of violence  â€”   at rallies when heâ€™s told supporters if they punch a protester heâ€™ll pay the legal bills, or at campaign stops when heâ€™s boasted murder wouldnâ€™t drive his supporters away  â€”   heâ€™s walked it back as just another quirky part of his humor. â€œObviously it was a joke,â€ he later said of the murder brag. Trumpâ€™s already spinning this newest threat, saying he meant that second amendment supporters could still stop Clintonâ€™s election  â€”   by voting, sillies! But that line, like much of his campaign rhetoric, is pure bullshit. While thereâ€™s some wiggle room in other parts of his statement whatâ€™s not up for debate is that he was talking about Clintonâ€™s powers after the election, if she wins  â€”   â€œif she gets to pick her judgesâ€. You canâ€™t stop someone from winning democratically if theyâ€™ve already won a democratic election  â€”   you have to do it criminally, and specifically, according to the rest of Trumpâ€™s quote, using â€œthe second amendmentâ€. Iâ€™ve no doubt that itâ€™s an unequivocal call for the use of gun violence to upend democracy and one for which Trump should not be given the benefit of the doubt. Even more stunning than any of Trumpâ€™s stunningly unpresidential behavior is that not every Republican has run straight for the hills. He even had backup from that Republican mainstay organization known as the National Rifle Association, which tweeted its support for his initial statement even as it altered its meaning by claiming Trump said if Clinton gets to pick supreme court judges, â€œthereâ€™s nothing we can do. â€ This is not party politics as usual. This goes beyond mere polarization or the other ills of Washington. Itâ€™s an attack on democracy thatâ€™s as personal as it is politically vile. Trump was talking in thinly veiled terms about the most personal kind of attack there is  â€”   an attack on the body and specifically, an attack on the body of the first female president.  The gendered element of it isnâ€™t lost on party leaders. Elizabeth Warren didnâ€™t mince words on Twitter this evening, saying Donald Trumpâ€œmakes death threats because heâ€™s a pathetic coward who canâ€™t handle the fact that heâ€™s losing to a girl. â€ Rebecca Traister has written brilliantly on the long history of powerful men like Trump who would delegitimize the ascent of women and minorities. But this  â€”   to have the nominee of a major party appear to encourage his supporters to assassinate his opponent  â€”   is unlike anything weâ€™ve seen before, quite likely for the simple reason that weâ€™ve never had a woman this close to the White House steps. Just as the birther movement that Trump helped lead was thinly veiled racism rooted in the belief that a black man couldnâ€™t possibly legitimately be the president, Trumpâ€™s insistence that â€œcrooked Hillaryâ€ has â€œstolenâ€ the election thrives among those who are angry that power could be taken from them by a woman, and specifically this one. Itâ€™s vulgar,   and undemocratic. And it was only a matter of time.",599,907,"792890826321985537	793144119249907712	798238066628509697	798633860946739202	807325330239324160	807588265138278400	807668672282169344	807669311875772416	807746392697569280	817831550616240129	817838360744095746	817841779034779650	817864419057266688	818154861451681792	818208671842893824	818267019279790080	818312749587435520	818326006343802881	818384557040877569	818516063151394817	818586459661889537	818864813816287232	819170988470452224	819320082744639488	819338232940949504	819371675737145345	819567766680338434	819864006936641536	820016176394735616	820288178586140673	824444529004711936	824570076703715328	824793969582276608	824857420472086528	826153955545726977	826278050480406528	826298699617796097	826325673220440064	826453075812577281	826541433633042432	826574013115805697	827009150278311936	827226273248342016	827327286529634305	827422024876298240	827635866214473730	828146765102710784	829870242633498624	829891221988450304	830112113586745344	830228074494976000	830320307311349760	830405079941443584	830423486094938113	830427636426010624	830429275291582464	830431008990314497	830459245476864000	830474421768818688	830480739229536256	830516045735604224	830551575923933184	830564934467584002	830596500937986048	830599127192973312	830601339948314624	830698406909710337	830711747896078336	830752322515005440	830757645535551488	830760453613690881	830769574626807809	830783776296935424	830802448008769537	830827372400095232	830834667272167425	830858630257844224	830859487397498883	830879807927885824	830885790649614337	830902770802753537	830915284202614784	830968050069491712	830969076457537540	830987934006341632	830989106834464768	830992518640783361	831002080273854465	831005016370663425	831067788903063552	831075241984155652	831089650223763456	831118372091863041	831135762859057152	831139197692084224	831147977720918016	831148145484656641	831370282669580288	831946048381845507	831982831396016128	832074110792560641	832094810928508932	832438618052579329	832449667023650816	832455903802642433	832706284105396224	833641542661181442	834395443790544897	835693981900161025	843927798121160705	846089486094209025	846119741550804992	852615937727410176	853045062007009280	880127252826132481	880128136591048704	880147010870956032	880225636698267649	880269983313481729	880504765637025792	880625596832854017	881094101118197760	881127990972887040	881556739996491777	882806322462244864",fake
politifact14992,http://www.trainnews.info/2018/01/rep-paul-gosar-asks-capitol-police-to.html,Rep. Paul Gosar Asks Capitol Police to Arrest Illegal Immigrants Attending State of the Union,"Rhonda Covington is short on time. As the only public defender for the 20th judicial district of Louisiana, she has a lot to take care of. At any given moment, she could be investigating cases, calling witnesses, scouring through evidence, taking photos at crime scenes (with her own camera) meeting with her clientsâ€™ families, writing motions, typing up pleadings, making appointments, answering the phones, answering the door, getting the mail at the post office, filling in timesheets, filing monthly reports, doing the accounting, paying the rent and utilities, cleaning the bathroom, dusting the furniture, sweeping and mopping the floors, taking out the trash, trimming the bushes, unclogging the plumbing, buying the toilet paper, or meeting with everyone arrested in a    area just north of Baton Rouge, within 72 hours of their arrest. â€œThere are days,â€ she says, â€œwhen I feel that I could literally scream to the top of my lungs for 10 minutes. â€ Every Wednesday, she makes an   trip to the infamous Angola prison to meet with clients.  Every other night, she visits inmates at the local jail.  Every weekend, she works. She also appears in court almost daily, where she handles all types of cases  â€”   juvenile and adult, misdemeanor and felony. Earlier this year, following what Governor John Bel Edwardsâ€™s office called â€œthe largest budget crisis in our stateâ€™s historyâ€ the Louisiana public defense system spiraled into fiscal ruin. Public defenders who had long depended on a highly unstable source of funding  â€”   traffic tickets  â€”   now saw their revenues slashed further. Soon, many districts were finding makeshift ways of getting by  â€”   including Caddo Parish, which conscripted tax attorneys, real estate attorneys and other novice recruits from the private bar to fill in for the overwhelmed defenders. But in other towns, public defense offices have been left to fend for themselves. Stripped of   attorneys, investigators, translators, social workers and support staff, they are now little more than ragtag,   squads. In the 16th judicial district, for example, a single public defender stands by as groups of up to 50 mostly black, poor defendants are convicted of and sentenced for major felonies  â€”   all at once, all together  â€”   in a few hours or less. And in the 20th district, exactly one woman, Covington, is employed   to represent poor people accused of crimes. Because her district initially received only $34, 086 in assistance from the state last year to run a public defenderâ€™s office that covers more than 900 cases across two parishes, East Feliciana and West Feliciana, Covington has been forced to cut just about everything but herself. She recently dismissed an attorney (savings: $38, 400 a year) reduced her secretary to   ($7, 194 a year) canceled the officeâ€™s cellphone plan ($1, 829. 28) and discontinued housekeeping services ($2, 400). She saves another $1, 000 a year by having an inmate work crew mow the yard outside her office.  Covington, whose clients call her â€œMs Rhondaâ€ wears a medical boot on her right foot because she tore a ligament a few months ago while running to the courthouse. She no longer has any health insurance, let alone workerâ€™s compensation, for the injury. She gets help around the office from two contract lawyers who chip in two days a week, and a makeshift office corps of two   $   paralegals and an intern during the summer. There are also her â€œoffice managersâ€: two cats, named Liberty and Justice. For All died a long time ago. On a Monday in June, Covington is frantically prepping copies of the docket for her next session in court. She can usually be found with a giant Sonic cup of Diet Coke in the crook of one arm (â€œIâ€™m addicted,â€ she says) and a handful of files in the other.  Her intern, Jimmy Zahorchak, is helping out for now by August, he will have gone back to law school at Louisiana State University. â€œOne summer of help, thatâ€™s all I get,â€ she says. â€œI can only pay him $10 an hour anyhow, so Iâ€™ll probably lose him to the DAâ€™s office. â€ Zahorchak is making copies of motions for her to sign while the phone is ringing off the hook.  â€œPublic defenderâ€™s office,â€ Covington answers. â€œHey dear, how are you? Would you hold, please?â€ She brings a second phone to her other ear. â€œPublic defenderâ€™s office, Rhonda speaking   â€¦     Oh, youâ€™re Ericâ€™s mother? His next trial date is 3 October,â€ she says from memory. Covington pours another Diet Coke, using her shoulders to keep the two phones pressed against her ears. A client comes through the door, explaining that his boss accused him of stealing a tractor, but he was just using it for side work, and  â€”   â€œHold on, Mr Brand, Iâ€™ll be right with you, donâ€™t go anywhere!â€ On the phone, she says: â€œWould you please tell them that even if you donâ€™t think those police interviews are important, I still want to hear them? Thank you, maâ€™am, I appreciate it. â€ Turning again to the client in her office, she asks: â€œNow, Mr Brand, what can I do for you?â€ Within an hour Covington is making her way to court, where she has to quickly help a few defendants take pleas before driving to West Feliciana Parish to grab some files at the courthouse there, after which she has to stop to pick up the mail. Then she is headed to the jail back in East Feliciana Parish to visit a new client named Mario Adams, who she thinks might be locked up on the wrong burglary warrant. â€œIt just doesnâ€™t feel right,â€ she says, pointing out that Adams is from Mississippi and that the police have no evidence he was even in East Feliciana at the time of the burglary. â€œI have to check it out. â€ Finally, a few minutes into that drive, while passing an inmate work crew on the left, Covington has a moment to lament how rushed she felt back in the courtroom. â€œThe clients insist on your full, undivided attention,â€ she says. â€œBut without any money, without any help, you just canâ€™t do it   â€¦     I shouldnâ€™t complain. I should save my complaining for my cases. â€ Covington says her father hates her criminal defense work. â€œEvery time he reads in the newspaper about some terrible crime somewhere, he calls me up and says: â€˜See, Rhonda, see, see? !â€™ The attitude of a lot of people in Louisiana is: â€˜If theyâ€™ve been arrested, then by damn   â€¦    â€™â€ Her response is always the same. â€œI just donâ€™t think it should be easy to take away somebodyâ€™s liberty. It shouldnâ€™t be cheap to take away someoneâ€™s liberty. â€ The district attorneyâ€™s office in Covingtonâ€™s district, after all, handles a similar caseload but with about $1m more in its budget. She used to be able to afford a translator, but now, whenever she has a   client, she has to rely on a police officer to translate their private discussions  â€”   which, she says, is a conflict for obvious reasons. She also had a case a few years ago in which a handwriting expert saved her client from going to jail, but she definitely would not be able to afford that now. When Covington gets to the jail, she is greeted by a chorus of â€œHeya there, Ms Rhonda!â€ She walks past a long, white board with the names of almost a hundred inmates scribbled on it. Most of them are her clients. Fifteen poor, black men shuffle into a courtroom together in southern Louisianaâ€™s Cajun country, dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles.  As they file into the jury box  â€”   which today is serving as the â€œplea boxâ€  â€”   their chains jingle against the old, hardwood floor. Here in the 16th judicial district, at the St Martinville courthouse, it is â€œfelony plea dayâ€ with Judge Gregory Aucoin presiding. Many of these defendants have not discussed their cases with their public defender yet, and they will have about 30 seconds to speak with him this morning. Then the judge, with a cigar dangling from his mouth, will ask: â€œAre you satisfied with the advice your attorney has given you in this matter?â€  â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir,â€ they will all say, down the row. â€œOK, I accept your plea agreement. â€ And just like that, with no time for arguments to be heard in each of their cases, they will have all pleaded guilty together, and will be headed to prison for years, sometimes decades. Last year, the 16th districtâ€™s public defenderâ€™s office was forced to cut $311, 000 from an already skeletal budget of about $1. 5m. As a result, they offered increasingly cursory assistance at these mass hearings, in which up to 50 defendants are collectively marched into a courtroom then convicted and sentenced to major felony charges carrying up to life in prison. â€œMass pleasâ€ of this sort are not unheard of in Louisiana and elsewhere in the country, especially in states with chronic public defender problems, including Pennsylvania, Utah, Michigan and Missouri. Usually, however, it is a process reserved for much smaller groups of defendants, especially in misdemeanor cases, while major felonies involving the possibility of significant prison time receive more individualized attention. As the hearing in St Martinville begins, the only defender in the courtroom, Gary LeGros, glances at the long list of people he is representing. Wearing a small hoop earring and a suit that hangs over his hands, he calls out to the defendants in the pews, who, unlike those in the plea box, were able to pay bail and came to court freely: â€œEveryone here whoâ€™s represented by the public defenderâ€™s office, please come up and print your name on this sheet!â€ LeGros holds up a legal pad, and over a dozen people stream forward. He then gives their names to an assistant, who rummages through several mammoth file boxes, looking for each case. One of the defendants, Brandon Washington, is facing burglary charges. He says he used to have a paid attorney but lost his job at a Halliburton factory and had to turn to the public defender. Several months after making that switch, he has no idea who his lawyer is and has never talked to him. â€œI think it may be that guy,â€ he says, referring to LeGros. LeGros soon makes his way into the jury box with the men in jumpsuits and chains. He asks for their names, calling back to his assistant to see if she has the relevant file. Then he gives each the option of making a deal, and if they say yes, he shouts over to the DA. â€œThat oneâ€™s a theft case, weâ€™ll do a deal,â€ shouts the DA. â€œOK,â€ says LeGros, after checking quickly with the defendant. â€œMr LeGros, whatâ€™s that one pleading?â€ â€œGuilty, I think. â€ As more deals are made across the room, there is little discussion of the nature of each case, or of the background and circumstances of each defendant. Every agreement is made in a matter of seconds, weighed and considered by each defendant for only a moment. Ultimately, no defendants will plead â€œnot guiltyâ€ today and go to trial.  In fact, of the 4, 492 felony cases in this district last year, there were only eight jury trials, and not because only eight people believed they were not guilty. The court schedule sets aside one week for trials every three months, and anyone who wants a trial has to wait, usually in jail, for one of those dates to come around. The public defenders, with no time to be more thorough, advise their clients that pleading is the surest, safest way to go. When everyone has been prepped for their â€œmass pleaâ€ a bank of white lawyers  â€”   defenders and prosecutors seated close together  â€”   face the panel of black defendants. The judge, Aucoin, starts reading off their pleas. He informs them of their rights, and in an instant, all are felons. LeGros turns to the defendantsâ€™ families, who have been watching from the front rows, and says: â€œWelcome to the criminal justice system. â€ If he had more funding, LeGros would spend more time doing â€œreal lawyer workâ€ as he puts it, instead of just processing his clients en masse. â€œI can pretty much keep track of all of them, and most cases donâ€™t require much attention,â€ he says by phone. â€œBut thereâ€™s no way all those boys understand whatâ€™s going on when they get their rights all together like that. I donâ€™t like it, but shit, Iâ€™m just a country lawyer. What you going to do?â€ Yet the group pleas are only partly the result of an underfunded public defenderâ€™s office, says Christopher Murell, a civil rights attorney in New Orleans and the executive director of the Promise of Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform organization. It is also about a courtroom culture  â€”   on the part of judges, DAs and public defenders alike  â€”   of trying to get all the cases processed expediently, without friction. The judges and DAs â€œget angry at you for not giving them a heads up that youâ€™re going to file a motion, because that will mess up their scheduleâ€ says Murell. â€œA fair trial is considered an interruption. â€ Cecelia â€œBeanieâ€ Bonin, is the chief public defender of the district (and Le Grosâ€™s boss). Her office is located adjacent to an   cemetery, in a   space that feels more like a basement. On a whiteboard at the back of one room, someone has listed a set of priorities: #1: How to go about getting the waitlist moving. #2: Review who needs an attorney. And further down the list, in all caps, #10: PROCEDURE FOR SANITY. When she took over the office in March 2015, Bonin thought she would begin by raising expectations. Her plan was to get control over the caseload, promote performance standards, and demand that her attorneys file more motions and have more meaningful conversations with their clients. She never considered that more than a year later, her attorneys would be watching helplessly during mass hearings like the one in St Martinville. But Bonin soon realized that when an office is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy, little else is possible. She could not afford enough attorneys to actually discuss pleas in advance, let alone develop relationships with defendants. Nor could she find good, experienced lawyers who would work for her in the first place, given how little she was able to pay them. The ones she already employed all needed to work two jobs to supplement their salaries, which begin at $34, 000 a year. One of Boninâ€™s lawyers had 345 active cases but was working only 15 hours a week. The rest of the time, she ran a private practice. In the 16th judicial district and across Louisiana, things have improved slightly for public defenders since July, when the state legislatureâ€™s new budget went into effect. Controversially, it slashed funding for the lawyers who represent defendants in death penalty cases, and shifted that money to the overwhelmed   defenders. Now, defendants facing the death penalty are finding themselves on waitlists for legal counsel.  Even with the shift in the budget, Rhonda Covington still labors alone, and the mass pleas have continued. One summer day in New Iberia, just down the road from St Martinville, Judge Thibodeaux turns toward a plea box of a dozen poor defendants. Smiling, he says to them: â€œYâ€™all just need to all commit the same crime next time, so we can do this faster. â€ A public defender goes over to them, learns their names, and makes a deal. Then the judge starts in,   them by reading off their rights. â€œDo you understand your right to a jury trial?â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir,â€ they all answer. â€œDo you understand your right to confront your accusers?â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œYes, sir. â€ â€œI canâ€™t hear you. Say, â€˜Yes, sir,â€™â€ the judge says to one defendant. â€œDo you understand that you have the right to counsel when the state proceeds against you?â€ The public defender is not paying attention. He is talking to the next batch of defendants, scribbling down their pleas.",910,526,"958425300144218112	958428242528145409	958428948748173313	958429138091569152	958429461329928194	958441875693764609	958441955456794625	958442175330684934	958442994587324416	958443044059140096	958443300876242944	958444378728562689	958445306529501184	958445961784721408	958446868903710721	958447271569510401	958447429128396800	958447662772125697	958454017469878273	958465082643664897	958474618184093696	958481711322619905	958490198828113921	958491080466591744	958491156261687296	958506699995918336	958518853046358016	958533848446459904	958679610853502976	958730788635398145	959138395132870656	959235379558789120",fake

The former secretary of stateâ€™s presidential campaign, in a bid to mock opponent Donald Trump as he makes a business trip to Scotland, has released a video emphasizing his widespread unpopularity in the UK. â€œDonald Trump has always been seen as something of a grotesque American curiosity,â€ a news anchor intones. â€œHis remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong,â€ David Cameron shouts. â€œDonald Trump is a fool,â€ mocks a member of Parliament. Donald Trump has released yet another fundraising email, this time with the subject line â€œLying Crooked Hillaryâ€: â€œHillary Clinton is a   liar. This much is a fact,â€ the email reads. â€œWe know we cannot count on the media to spread the very important message that Hillary Clinton is a liar and canâ€™t be trusted,â€ it continues, â€œAnd thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve decided to take that message directly to the American people. Weâ€™ve unveiled a brand new website, LyingCrookedHillary. com, and weâ€™re rolling out a series of videos  â€”   one on each of her biggest, phoniest fibs and fabrications. â€ The attached video, highlighting the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed four American lives, proclaims that â€œHillary has no shame!â€ Bernie Sanders, as he promised, addresses the rise of Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. â€œWe understand that Trump is so   I mean, itâ€™s hard almost to imagine   a man who has such limited capabilities becoming president,â€ Sanders says, sounding horrified. â€œWhat is even uglier is that you think about the struggles that we have gone through as a nation   the hundreds of years fighting against racism, fighting against sexism, and that this guy is making the cornerstone of his campaign bigotry!â€ Trump, Sanders says, â€œis insulting Mexicans and Latinos, insulting Muslims, insulting women, insulting African Americans . .. We have got to work tirelessly to make sure that Trump is not president   but that is not good enough! What we have got to do is to continue the vision of transforming this country. â€ â€œAnd most importantly, I know that we can do that, is for all of us to get involved in the political prrocess. We need great peopel on school boards on city councils,â€ Sanders says. â€œLet me just say: The struggle continues!â€ Sanders says, as David Bowieâ€™s Starman plays and he exits the stage after a   speech. If the theme of tonightâ€™s speech is â€œWhere We Go From Here,â€ itâ€™s fair to wonder, one hour into Bernie Sandersâ€™ address, if we will ever get there. â€œHow long do we have to tolerate that kind of greed, which has done so much harm to this country?â€ Sanders says of Wall Street banks. â€œWe gotta break them up!â€ The audience, indefatigable, leaps to its feet and chants â€œBREAK THEM UP! BREAK THEM UP! BREAK THEM UP!â€ â€œA corrupt campaign finance system breeds corrupt public policy,â€ Bernie Sanders says. â€œSo right now, you have profitable corporations making billions of dollars a year in profit, that in a given year, put their money in the Cayman Islands and in a given year do not pay a nickel in federal taxes!â€ â€œChildren sleep out in the street and are undernourished and corporations do not pay a nickel in federal taxes   that, together, we are going to change. â€ â€œThis campaign is about building a   grassroots campaign organization,â€ Sanders says. â€œThis campaign is about bringing millions of people into the political process. This campaign is about empowering people to understand that democracy is not a spectator sport, and that when we stand together, we can transform this country. â€ â€œRight now,â€ Sanders says, â€œthere are meetings of the Democratic platform committee   we have five people on it. The platform that will come out of the Democratic convention will be, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the party. â€ â€œBut the platform is 50 or 60 pages of paper,â€ Sanders says. â€œThat platform doesnâ€™t mean anything unless we make certain that those ideas are incorporated into public policy!â€ The audience leaps to its feat. â€œWeâ€™re gonna take a hard look at our disastrous trade policies, making sure that the TPP is dead!â€ Sanders says, of the   Partnership. â€œAnd, in Orlando, appropriately enough, weâ€™re gonna fight to make sure that we ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons, that we end the   loophole. â€ â€œIf you were talking to somebody from another world, and you had to explain the Republican rules on guns, and you said that we have lists of people who canâ€™t get on planes,â€ Sanders says, â€œbut no problem, they can walk into a gun store, people would think you were crazy!â€ Bernie Sanders has gone into full    railing against the pharmaceutical industry for the high cost of healthcare, and intimating that the mainstream media fails to cover the high prices of prescription drugs because of advertising revenue. â€œI was very proud to see that now a majority of Democrats in fact support a      system,â€ Sanders says. â€œHere is an issue that together we have brought to the floor, and it ainâ€™t never gonna go away. â€ â€œWe have got to make public colleges and universities  !â€ Sanders says, reiterating another popular plank of his candidacy. â€œI have no doubt, I have zero doubt that this is a fight that weâ€™re going to win. â€ Speaking of the   debt of many college graduates, Sanders says: â€œThat is nonsense   it is unacceptable. â€ â€œI think it makes a lot more sense to invest in education for all of our people than to give tax breaks to billionaires!â€ Sanders says, to sustained applause. â€œAnd what started year ago is a radical idea   nobody thinks its radical anymore. â€ â€œYou know, I think most Americans would agree that when we talk about what constitutes a great nation, it is not the number of billionaires that you have, it is not the number of nuclear weapons you have, it is how you treat the most vulnerable people in the country,â€ Bernie Sanders says, again reiterating nearly verbatim a frequent adage from his stump speech. â€œAnd year after year after year, the numbers cry out at us,â€ Sanders says. â€œThis country today has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. These children are the future of this country, and they are growing up in extremely bad conditions. Housing is inadequate, nutrition is inadequate, childcare is inadequate. That is not acceptable if you are a patriotic person who loves this county   youâ€™ve gotta love the children of this country!â€ The audience leaps to its feat for roughly the twentieth time. â€œThere are schools in America where more of the kids in those schools end up in jail than they do graduating college,â€ Sanders continues, before dropping another frequent invocation: â€œMaybe its time for us to invest in jobs and education for our young people, not jails and incarceration!â€ â€œSome people think that it is idealistic, that it is utopian, to talk about making a moral economy in which the function of the economy is to provide wealth for children and the elderly and the middle class,â€ Sanders says. â€œThat is the practicality of what we have got to do, and what we can do!â€ â€œWe cannot allow ourselves to become used to the fact that weâ€™ve got hundreds of thousands of children in this country who are homeless!â€ Sanders says. â€œThat is our greatest danger   becoming used to it and thinking that it is normal. It is not normal   it is an outrage!â€ â€œNever, ever lose your sense of outrage!â€ The audience goes wild   â€œBernie! Bernie! Bernie!â€ Finally touching on the issue of â€œwhere we go from here,â€ Bernie Sanders tells the crowd that he has â€œgreat peopleâ€ involved in the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia who will push his populist agenda. â€œWe have great people on the rules committee, and one of the issues that weâ€™re going to push for on the rules committee is to end closed primaries!â€ Sanders says. â€œIt is also a fight to end the absurd situation where superdelegates can overrule the rule of the people!â€ â€œWe might as well transform the entire Democratic party!â€ Bernie Sanders tells the audience that supporters on limited incomes who raised money for his campaign were in it to win it. â€œBecause we love you!â€ a voice shouts from the crowd. â€œNonono   not about me!â€ Sanders responds, as the audience laughs and applauds. â€œIt has to be about us!â€ â€œYou know what? You can beat the establishment,â€ Bernie Sanders says, in reference to his primary campaign. â€œWe won! In New York state, we had to take on the entire Democratic establishment. â€ â€œI have no doubt that a strong,   grassroots movement can take on the establishment and can defeat the establishment, and that is precisely what we have got to do and what the political revolution is about. â€ For those unfamiliar with Sandersâ€™s stump speech, much of what follows largely reiterates aspects of the same speech he has been giving for more than a year. â€œIn this campaign, in every single state, we won, often by big numbers, the votes of young people!â€ Sanders says. â€œWhat it means is that our vision, a vision of economic, social, racial, environmental justice is the vision of the people who will create the future of America!â€ â€œIn this campaign, hundreds of thousands of volunteers made 75 million telephone calls,â€ Sanders says. â€œAnd we are just getting started!â€ â€œReal change is not easy and real change never takes place from the top on down   always from the bottom on up,â€ Bernie Sanders says, echoing a line frequently used in his stump speeches. â€œAnd that is what our political revolution is all about. â€ Sanders reveals that his new schedule of upcoming events   unusual for a candidate who has functionally lost the nomination but has not yet conceded   will be held in support of downballot candidates seeking to enter politics. In Syracuse tomorrow evening, Sanders says, â€œweâ€™ll be campaigning for a guy who is running for the United States Congress   I am gonna do everything I can do make sure that he wins. We are gonna go back to California and campaign for a woman running for the state senate in California and make sure that she wins!â€  â€œWeâ€™re gonna go all over this country, because that is what this political revolution is all about!â€ Sanders says. â€œItâ€™s not about me   itâ€™s about people at the grassroots level. Itâ€™s about people running for school boards, for mayor, for the state legislature!â€ What our campaign has been about and is about is saying   sorry! weâ€™re thinking big, we want real change! The audience leaps to its feet, chanting â€œBernie! Bernie! Bernie!â€ Bernie Sanders reminds the audience that other social movements, like those for civil rights and womenâ€™s suffrage, lasted for decades before eventually succeeding. Remind yourselves, Sanders tells the crowd, to the â€œpeople who were killed, people who were beaten, people who were jailed standing up for dignity and human rights. â€ â€œThink about the gay movement! Think about Stonewall!â€ Sanders says. â€œThink about the revolutionary changes that have taken place because the gay community and their straight allies said that people should have, must have, he right to be with who they love, regardless of gender!â€ â€œI want you al to remember   now I was there, Iâ€™m a little bit older than many of you,â€ Sanders jokes, bringing laughs from the youthful crowd, â€œbut people stood up proudly and with dignity and they continued the fight for gay rights. â€   years ago, Sanders signed a proclamation as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, declaring June 22 â€œGay Pride Day. â€ Speaking to the crowd of 1, 500 supporters at the Town Hall theater in Midtown Manhattan, Bernie Sanders promises that although his path to the Democratic presidential nomination remains uncertain, his â€œpolitical revolutionâ€ will continue. â€œThe main point that Iâ€™m gonna make tonight,â€ Sanders says, â€œis this political rev is not about Bernie Sanders, itâ€™s not about Nina Turner   itâ€™s about you and millions of other people. â€ In the political revolution inspired by his candidacy, Sanders says, â€œyou are the revolutionaries! And what this campaign has shown, not just in winning 13 million votes, not just taking on the establishment all over this county, what is has shown is that millions of people are prepared to stand up, fight back and create the nation that we know we can become. â€ The audience explodes into applause. â€œAll of you know, who have studied history, that election days come and go but what is much more important is that political and social revolutions continue. â€",149,737,8.66E+17,fake
politifact13475,genius.com/discussions/219349-Donald-trump-protester-speaks-out-i-was-paid-s3500-to-protest-trumps-rally,"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: “I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump’s Rally”","Venezuelaâ€™s opposition has said that talks with the government were â€œfrozenâ€ after officials failed to attend meetings, throwing cold water on   attempts to bridge the countryâ€™s deep political crisis.  Though the formal talks, which began last month, appeared to have led to the release of a handful of detained activists, hopes for real rapprochement were always slim. The two sides are fundamentally at loggerheads, with the opposition seeking to oust the socialist president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, while authorities vow he will not leave office before his term ends in 2019.  â€œThe government, in an irresponsible manner, froze the dialogue process by not showing up to two technical meetings last night,â€ opposition coalition leader JesÃºs Torrealba told Reuters.  Opposition activists said authorities backed away after the national assembly on Tuesday held a heated session in which they slammed Maduro over a drug scandal.  Two nephews of Maduroâ€™s wife were found guilty this month on charges in the US that they tried to carry out a   drug deal to help their family stay in power.  â€œThe government is using the debate as an excuse,â€ said   presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, accusing authorities of not being committed to talks.  â€œThe government has not complied with any of its promises. They promised to free political prisoners there are more than 100 imprisoned. They promised [to open] a humanitarian channel not a single medicine has come in. â€  The information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  It was not clear if the talks could be revived or if the opposition would resume a more militant agenda, which before the talks included protests and putting Maduro on trial before the national assembly.  Mediators appeared to be trying to save the talks. Spainâ€™s   minister JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero and US diplomat Thomas Shannon were holding or seeking meetings with both sides.  Dialogue had divided the diverse opposition coalition, with some activists feeling the government was duping the opposition to buy time. Previous   also showed little progress. The situation in   Venezuela has worsened in the past few months, with a recession leaving millions unable to find or afford food amid shortages and soaring inflation.  The opposition blames Maduro, who is unpopular, and has been vying to remove him via a recall referendum.

politifact15356,https://miamipost.co/2018/05/06/breaking-3-liberal-celebrities-arrested-for-conspiracy-to-assassinate-president-trump/,BREAKING: 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump,"When I was 16, my dad and I were parked outside the Express Dairy in Wembley, chatting in the front of our car. Weâ€™d been there for about 10 minutes when there was a knock on the window. It was a police officer. Someone had reported the presence of two suspicious men in a vehicle. As we drove off, my dad chuckled at the idea that anyone could think of us, a   man and his son in a Volvo estate, as a threat. I laughed too, but I wouldnâ€™t have if Iâ€™d realised that incidents like this were soon to become commonplace. Here, in 1984, was an end to boyhood and the start of my journey into adulthood  â€”   into becoming a black man. What this meant in practice was that my body was no longer my own. Being a black man means being subject to the white gaze. It means becoming an object of prejudice and fascination, simultaneously hypervisible and invisible to white society, your emotions and inner life ignored. The tropes are familiar and still potent: black men as supernaturally gifted at sports and entertainment, in possession of hulking bodies and ungovernable sexuality, liable to lapse into violence and lawlessness. When I walk down the street, the sense of being scrutinised and judged and typecast still is never far from my mind. Itâ€™s an uncomfortable feeling to live with. But, given the option, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d ever choose to surrender it. Through that awareness of how different, contradictory, perspectives can flourish simultaneously, great art can emerge art that puts black men at the centre of an image as nuanced subjects rather than stereotypes. Iâ€™ve attempted to explore these themes of identity, maleness, race and power in a new exhibition, Made You Look, at the Photographerâ€™s Gallery in London. The show examines how black men shape their   in front of the camera. It gathers work by artists including Malick Sidibe, celebrated for capturing the vibrant life of a newly independent Mali in the 1960s and 70s Samuel Fosso, who pictures himself in a variety of slyly amusing guises and assumed identities and Hassan Hajjaj, who photographed men meticulously dressed in vivid African prints against bright backgrounds of clashing colours. This is a time of marked gain and loss for black people. For while this is a period of unprecedented black prominence  â€”   from Barack Obama in the White House to artists such as BeyoncÃ©, Steve McQueen, Marlon James, Kanye West  â€”   black people are still victim to the consequences of entrenched racism. More than 500 black and   people in Britain have died in suspicious circumstances while in state detention over the past 25 years, without a single official being successfully prosecuted. In America, one in three black men can expect to go to jail at some point in their lives. And the list of   men killed in recent years solely because of their skin colour  â€”   Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Freddie Gray among them  â€”   continues to grow. Against this fragile backdrop, Made You Look focuses on the figure of the black dandy. Dandyism, defined as a man â€œunduly concerned with looking stylish and fashionableâ€ might seem like trivial concerns in the era of the Black Lives Matter campaign. But as the case of Trayvon Martin, shot by George Zimmerman for looking â€œsuspiciousâ€ in a hoodie, attests to the fact that how you dress can sometimes be the difference between life and death. Dandyism is also about using dress to flout conventional notions of class, taste, gender and sexuality  â€”   certainly the case with the majestically louche Soweto youth majestically decked out in flared sleeveless suits and pearls, shot by South African   Moolman, and the strikingly beautiful young man photographed in New York by Jeffrey Henson Scales. Such images point to the subversive power of dandyism to reveal masculinity itself as a performance, as something provisional, open to reinterpretation, rather than a set of inherited characteristics fixed in the skin. And they also highlight how, for black men, style is a form of radical personal politics. As a teenager, having to grapple for the first time with the force of the white gaze, Iâ€™d ask myself this question: how do you live without fear or debilitating anger in a world where youâ€™re constantly reminded that your body doesnâ€™t belong to you? The answer, as proposed by the works in this show, is to demand to be seen on your own terms, via the style and attitude that announces your ambitions and desires, your sense of pride and inner belief. For the most part, the men featured in the exhibition arenâ€™t wearing the finest of clothes. They seem less concerned with what they wear than how they wear it. Their style is by turns flamboyant, provocative, arresting, camp, playful and assertive. It is about confounding expectations about how black men should look or carry themselves in order to establish a place of personal freedom: a place beyond the white gaze, where the black body is a site of liberation rather than oppression.

MartÃ­nez was sacked on Thursday following a dismal run of results and performances that indicated the players had stopped responding to his methods. Southamptonâ€™s manager, Ronald Koeman, is the preferred replacement of Farhad Moshiri, Evertonâ€™s major shareholder, with Frank de Boer also under consideration. David Unsworth, Joe Royle and Duncan Ferguson will take charge of Evertonâ€™s final home game of the season against Norwich City on Sunday, when Howard will bring his distinguished decade with the club to an end. The USA international is to join Colorado Rapids in MLS on 1 July. Howard was on the bench for feeble away displays at Liverpool, Leicester City and Sunderland  â€”   when there were a total of 84 shots on the Everton goal  â€”   and denies witnessing a team that had stopped playing for their manager. â€œThat is a grenade that people throw and they duck and watch to see what happens. Itâ€™s a load of rubbish,â€ the Everton goalkeeper insisted. â€œThere is so much in the head of a footballer. You pull that shirt on, you run out on the pitch and the last thing that crosses your mind is: â€˜Hey, Iâ€™ve got an idea, Iâ€™m just going to strut around here because I am going to get the manager sacked. Letâ€™s do that.â€™ â€œI donâ€™t know how that works. I donâ€™t think anyone thinks like that individually. We donâ€™t sit around in the dressing room and have a   that we are all going to down tools. I donâ€™t really know where that comes from. â€ MartÃ­nez repeatedly denied that a squad he labelled the strongest of his tenure had underachieved this season. Everton are 12th in the Premier League and have recorded the lowest points total at home since the introduction of three points for a win in 1981. Howard said: â€œI think we have underachieved this season. The players have probably let ourselves down. Any time a manager loses his job, they canâ€™t replace 22 of us, which is probably unfortunate for them. It is always the manager who ends up suffering. Roberto has not kicked a ball all season. That is down to us. The results have not been good enough for the talent we have and the squad. That is no secret. â€œEveryone needs a bit of luck. We have a fantastic squad here that keeps getting talked about. We are going to finish   or just below. We have no   right to do anything or finish higher. We have to earn that right. This team is good enough to compete near the top and if it has been a disappointing year then so be it. â€œThe foundation is there. The next manager that comes in will be delighted to see some of the faces here at his disposal and to be able to mould that team, play the way he wants to. He will be sitting on a goldmine. â€ The    will make his 414th and final Everton appearance on Sunday, having decided against staying at Goodison Park until his contract expires in 2018. Howard had a few   with supporters before losing his place to Joel Robles midway through the season but insists the exchanges played no part in his decision to return to the US. â€œI was irritated that we werenâ€™t playing well,â€ he said. â€œI love the supporters here. They get pissed off when we lose, I get pissed off when we lose. I never go home happy when we lose. It is no different. Someone has something to say to me that is   then I say something back even if it is at the grocery store or at Goodison. There wasnâ€™t any spat. They were pissed off we werenâ€™t playing well and so was I. â€œThat didnâ€™t influence my thinking about the future. My plan was always to see out my contract  â€”   I love this club. As we know this is a business and it is a tough business sometimes. I have two young children, I wanted to have an opportunity leading up to the World Cup to be in the shop window right in front of my [international] manager every week. â€œFrom a contractual stand point, Colorado offered me another year and a half on the back of my contract. Those are all real things. People talk about footballers being robots but this is all real life. If that was offered to my dad in the truck yard he would probably take it because it makes sense. Ten years seemed like the right time. I will always be an Evertonian but this just seemed like the right time. â€",99,58,"954743163285106688	954747008132186112	954749719175159809	954750542445760513	954754108581384192	954757056006885377	954814641775038466	954820557748318208	954844127690149888	954942611177041920	954944372499415040	955065076662317056	955095902166966272	955138502953488384	955147633781297152	955157691625750528	955161201293410304	955208186306416640	955446821102514177	955464174406193152	955658730376327168	955736870264041473	955834908928282629	955968689978990594	956097316368285697	956227006672310272	956312484125667328	956520700201795584	956558387625435136	956574480519737344	956721082169511936	956843586473078784	957059219332747271	957076164190892033	957139922338512897	957219508711804928	957242582043684864	957338905627340800	957422404917235712	957490520250560512	957564333164257280	957679344796798976	957714095775539200	957809994056937474	958048904448217089	958113773482577926	958127168969572353	958179756763000832	958344728231194624	958355331209457666	958593518464897025	958657408993251360	958714026447572992	958729130002051072	958736602305622017	958842172962492416	959473558069153792	959475080802848771	960608419119017984	980160463202856960",fake
politifact14362,dailyfeed.news/russian-mansions-obama-seized-were-meant-to-be-illegal-gifts-to-sasha-and-malia/,BUSTED: Russian Mansions Obama Seized Were Meant To Be Illegal Gifts To Sasha And Malia,"The    home of Josiah Bartlett, a New Hampshire doctor who signed the Declaration of Independence after John Hancock and later became governor, is still available two years after it was put up for sale by his     granddaughter. Bartlett is also the fictional ancestor of one of Americaâ€™s greatest fictional presidents, Josiah Bartlet, who was played by Martin Sheen in the   TV hit The West Wing. His actual descendant, Ruth Albert, has spent much of her life in the house in the town of Kingston. Now 65, she wants to downsize. Albert has no children, however, and she has exhausted her list of cousins. Last year, she was approached by a fellow   Bartlett who lives in Florida, but that didnâ€™t work out. â€œI held on and held on,â€ the retired postal worker said, adding that the Florida descendant was considering moving to New Hampshire to pursue a doctorate.  â€œI guess at one point in time, she was thinking it would be kind of cool to go to Dartmouth, because thatâ€™s where a lot of our ancestors got their doctorate degrees. And then I think she decided it was just a little too cold up there. â€ Albert took the property, about 10 miles from Massachusetts, off the market for the winter and advertised it again this spring. The      colonial farmhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is selling for $549, 900. It has a linden tree that Bartlett brought back from Philadelphia as a sapling after signing the Declaration of Independence. Little has changed beyond kitchen and bathroom renovations and mechanical upgrades. Bartlettâ€™s medical instruments are displayed in the parlor. One end of the second floor still has an outhouse and tin bathtub with a pump. Additional land near the house can be bought, bringing the price to $849, 900. â€œPeople have been coming to look at it, but I havenâ€™t had any serious offers,â€ Albert said. Ben Wilson, director of New Hampshireâ€™s Bureau of Historic Sites, said the state could not afford to buy and operate the house without an endowment. â€œHistoric buildings, landscapes and monuments take an extra level of care, so the bureau tries very hard to make the most of the resources it has,â€ he said.  â€œTaking on a new property that is not endowed would place an extra burden on the services and experiences we currently provide to our thousands of visitors. â€ Plan New Hampshire, a group that evaluates communitiesâ€™ strengths, said the house was â€œuniquely important to the town, the state and the countryâ€ and that it could be used as a restaurant, brewery or bed and breakfast. Bartlett was born in Amesbury, Massachusetts in 1729. He moved to Kingston in 1750 to set up practice. He married his cousin Mary Bartlett, and they had 12 children. He died in 1795. One of his sons, Dr Levi Bartlett, lived in the house, and it has stayed in the family since.",862,623,"885291087170088962	885297352214491136	885316168550150144	885350587356860418	885383864893546496	885433720861335552	885437952805003264	885475584134053888	885547512718917632	885561640669904897	885610989017858048	885636307271024640	885672879601438720	885710480928460802	885949906803937281	886182844179021824	886284677371150337	886330519914504193	886330820549595137	886330926745223169	886436530100867072	886651996790562817	886655220712964096	886667719885586432	886673847289880576	886691200387952640	886759483027881986	886784684805558272	886789122441883648	886801103639240704	886816100985581568	886938506047762437	886968644894416900	887118821382905856	887189627697860609	887454423865106432	887838410492301312	888186466735730688	888659600668409856	893555798479052800	897197348450955266	1036112499391782912",fake
politifact14944,http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/369928-who-is-affected-by-the-government-shutdown,Who is affected by the government shutdown?,"Las Vegas is due to witness its most surreal showdown since Mike Tyson repeatedly bit Evander Holyfieldâ€™s ear in the middle of a heavyweight boxing match, as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off in the third and final debate before the presidential election. For Trump, Wednesday nightâ€™s debate may be the last opportunity to salvage the dwindling support that in recent weeks has seemingly placed the election increasingly out of the Republican nomineeâ€™s reach. The encounter at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, comes as both campaigns are beset by controversy in the final stretch of the most unusual presidential campaign in modern history. Clinton has been forced to contend with the illegal hacking of her campaign chairmanâ€™s emails, leaked in tranches by WikiLeaks in what the US government has described as the work of Russian intelligence.  Trump has faced even greater obstacles, stemming from an unearthed tape in which he boasted of groping women without their consent that prompted a number of women to come forward with accusations of sexual assault against the real estate mogul over a nearly   period. The debate, moderated by Fox Newsâ€™ Chris Wallace, will focus on six topics: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president. But as in the last two debates between Trump and Clinton, policy is expected to take a back seat to the unpredictable behaviour associated with Trump. The former reality TV star, who has spent the past week darkly warning of voter fraud, has one more chance to try to staunch his leaking support in the polls. Polling aggregator Real Clear Politics shows Clinton with an average lead of almost seven points in recent polls, a lead comparable to that of Barack Obama over John McCain at a similar point in the 2008 election. Even deeply Republican states such as Alaska, Utah and Texas are within the margin of error in some surveys and the Clinton campaign, buoyed by its momentum, is now investing in conservative battlegrounds that include Arizona, Indiana and Missouri. Clinton has maintained a tradition of burying herself in debate preparation in recent days, thus keeping a lighter footprint on the campaign trail. Trump, by contrast, has been notoriously averse to readying himself for the debates and has suffered through two below par performances. Even so, the Republican nominee mocked Clinton at a Colorado rally on Tuesday as â€œrestingâ€. â€œItâ€™s lying down and going to sleep,â€ Trump said, taking another veiled jab at Clintonâ€™s health despite records disclosed by the former secretary of state last month showing no significant medical issues. Clintonâ€™s campaign said her focus would remain on policy in the debate regardless of Trumpâ€™s efforts to rattle her with criticisms intended for a base that routinely engages in chants of â€œLock her upâ€ at his rallies. â€œWhat we have seen is that when she does do that, the character of Hillary Clinton thatâ€™s revealed to voters is someone that is quite capable of standing up to him and defending American values and reaffirming them,â€ Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for Clintonâ€™s campaign, told reporters on Tuesday. â€œWe know that [Trump] thought that strategy of scorched earth would depress our vote but, if anything, we have found that itâ€™s helped to motivate our voters. â€ Trump, having shown himself to be lacking in substance on the issues, will have to rely on his improvisational style to carry him through the   encounter. But Wednesday night will mark the first time Trump will be questioned before a national audience of this scale about the sexual assault allegations against him, as well as his baseless claims of voter fraud to assert that the election is â€œriggedâ€. Several   Republicans have refuted Trumpâ€™s claim of illicit activity at the ballot box. Palmieri did not say if Clinton would address the matter at the debate, stating instead that the campaign was â€œconfident in the electionâ€. â€œWe understand the strategy that he is trying to do to explain his loss and also to try to deter voters,â€ she said, â€œ[but] we believe that itâ€™s going to be easier to vote than ever before. â€ While most of those on the Las Vegas Strip were busy milling between slot machines and Blackjack tables on the eve of the debate, many acknowledged the gambling would come to a halt on Wednesday evening. The election, several people said, was simply too captivating. Javier Solano, of Yuma, Arizona, said he was on holiday but would not miss the final event. â€œI donâ€™t know what to expect from Trump,â€ he said, â€œbut he isnâ€™t a candidate fit to be president. â€ Solano, who said he was voting for Clinton, had some advice for Trumpâ€™s supporters: â€œYou canâ€™t just be angry. You have to make the right choice, thinking not just about what affects you but what affects everyone. â€ Joe Jessome, of Ontario, Canada, was in town for a conference but also planned to watch the debate. Jessome, who said his American wife and two children planned to cast their ballots for Trump, expects a more â€œbalancedâ€ debate under the helm of Fox News. â€œI think the moderators are really biased toward the Democrats and Hillary Clinton,â€ he said. â€œ[Although] Donald Trump speaks before he thinks a lot of the time and made lewd comments 11 years ago   â€¦     itâ€™s more about the economy and whatâ€™s going on in the world. Hillary Clinton, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, is â€˜Crooked Hillaryâ€™. â€ Brandon Davis, a Trump supporter from California, agreed. â€œEveryoneâ€™s been against him from the beginning,â€ he said, while noting Clinton had â€œa lot of baggageâ€. While the debates have been marked by a bitterness bordering on contempt, Clinton and Trump will meet again at a decidedly more   venue on Thursday. Both candidates are scheduled to attend the Alfred E Smith dinner, an annual fundraiser for Catholic charities in New York, less than 24 hours after they share the debate stage. The two will sit on either side of Cardinal Timothy Dolan at the white tie gala.",379,413,"954602090462146560	954602093171609600	954650329668349954",fake

A time when we remember a feast, the first Thanksgiving, on Plymouth plantation in the autumn of 1621. The tales of pilgrims from the Mayflower who celebrated the harvest, shared and broke bread with the first Americans, are still used as inspiration and shared with children, teaching them the beauty of gratitude. But it is now widely understood this Thanksgiving story is a fictional history. It was invented to whitewash the vicious genocide wrought upon the native inhabitants of this magnificent continent. Not only did the Europeans try to eradicate native populations, but they made every effort to eviscerate their culture, their language and eliminate them from these coveted lands. From Plymouth Rock to Standing Rock, this lie has made our Thanksgiving Day a day of mourning for the First Nations, all the tribes big and small, those who came before us. A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux In North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over 500 tribes and thousands of others standing on the frontlines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. The camp grows as winter comes. Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty. Everyone we talk with is committed to peaceful resistance. Weapons, alcohol and drugs are forbidden there. Standing together in prayer to protect water displays a deeply rooted awareness of lifeâ€™s interconnected nature, and of the intrinsic value and import of traditional ways. This growing movement stems from love, it is the most human instinct to protect that which we love. An eager and engaged youth are at the core of this pipeline route resistance, learning from a population of elders who pass down unforgotten knowledge.  It is an awakening. All here together, with their   relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and national guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, above all other expressed concerns. They stand against corporate security forces, the county sheriff and the national guard. Standing while being hit with water cannons, mace, teargas, rubber bullets. Standing without weapons and praying, the water protectors endure human rights abuses in freezing temperatures. Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world, that an American corporate media is not free to report. Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. But they stand, their hair frozen from water cannons. They stand for all that is good and they stay strong. We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately.  We will be going back to support the water protectors again.  Let us all stand with them in thanks, in appreciation for the ancient wisdom they carry, in thanks for this opportunity for true gratitude. For giving us a path forward. For trying to show us a road to survival. We offer our support and our respect. We hear the call to protect the water protectors to listen, learn and get engaged. They are brave. We thank them. And we can give thanks for the bounty. Like water on the garden of activism, Americaâ€™s surprise president brings a bounty of opportunity. The great issues of our time are now brightly illuminated and people are becoming more aware of them than ever, from sea to shining sea, from Standing Rock to Wall Street. The surprise   was not the winner of the popular vote, does not have a mandate for the change of ideals envisioned. Keep in mind, close to over two million more people voted for another candidate. Nor is the surprise president the leader of the free world. Two hundred of the worldâ€™s nations believe in science, above the profits of the oil, gas and coal industries, and are committed to working together to protect the future from an unchecked climate crisis. The surprise president claims he does not believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways. Do not be intimidated by the surprise presidentâ€™s cabinet appointees as they descend the golden escalator. Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders. The golden tower is not yours. The White House is your house.  Your growing activism in support of freedom over repression, addressing climate change, swiftly replacing a destructive old industries with safe, regenerative energy, encouraging holistic thinking in balance with the future of our planet that activism will strengthen and shed continued light on us all. These worthy goals must be met for all the worldâ€™s children and theirs after them.  This is our moment for truth.  Unintimidated, stand, speak up and show up. Be counted. Be like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock. Be there if you can. The progress we have made over 240 years as a nation, has always come first from the people.  Thank you, Neil Young and Daryl Hannah",761,461,"740351669834244096	740391312277573632	740474600514027520	740536370511368192	740537422266699777	740556986295652352	740563857555529734	740572347053154305	740577838009458697	740579086569865217	740603976601636864	740604078720438272	740617155595632640	740640512428892160	740643794849136642	740648731448639488	740680709845614592	740686763924934656	740688866340835328	740692358795284489	740693860574199808	740694939273551873	740694938606653441	740700809235730432	740701713284358144	740705186511884292	740708723014803456	740710965881147392	740713050144014337	740713351903215616	740718469872648193	740723689793015808	740736704500387841	740746142699401216	740755491618476032	740778092482940928	740799668238581760	740857137677668352	740886471310086144	740916120253669376	740917279702024192	740924724604076032	740941206587199488	740945289083650049	740959640582660096	740967770905444354	740982156952932356	740983196771196928	740988430457282564	740990094518194176	741002050108940288	741004363187916801	741010601397387264	741012443829276672	741014655452094465	741016144681656321	741019840912207873	741028454603227136	741029865495875584	741030815895670784	741035148007866368	741035996171603968	741040380347441153	741042646978691072	741046219594567680	741049824082956288	741054634257702912	741054659515809792	741059259694120960	741091531969290240	741100563945820160	741111432641695744	741160950473084928	741166560803467264	741178017884602368	741182953456316416	741227026510712832	741320946028445696	741334568427458560	741362847083601924	741364912568467456	741373134767423488	741402660734152704	741447163612430336	741722616373772289	741741501730816000	741773919531728896	741801079311044608	741810722959699970	741811043089809408	741827636834533376	741832204498657280	741875302901645312	741931515253301248	741931873102880768	741946510020083712	741989522481807360	742023653508808704	742049593895051264	742063113617342464	742064069046308865	742105154569265152	742109544478707713	742136333892608000	742155503082446848	742233177310298112	742312413173714944	742385474094796800	742482052046585857	742590961176301568	742593923671941120	742597133694566400	742663080404881408	742685612357095424	742694849065816064	742753155570503680	742836636698836992	742865370579509248	742879069142843392	742915665733033984	742946376317829124	743107267986231296	743553025319407616	743568952777912320	743821602555592704	745454044328558595	747204895762157568	747842357886844928	748407850037186560	748455929746591744	748493801480663040	748495163383640067	748601571689238528	748622239017336832	748622340381097985	748855777750818817	748891585023053824	749031503296860160	749230411780198401	749280578483081216	749316123179438080	749344722318139392	749583900179963905	749583912494469120	749591468608598016	749767776844206082	749816509342494722	749827267077910528	749989654708060160	750005909141741568	750013598424977408	750098374905344001	750112672654303232	750115620377620481	750184886921678848	750444643951710208	750920919804211204	751140071039008768	751162651011493888	751570220020592640	752871214276685824	754104724937383936	754399376458473473	754617815873847296	754724787029733376	754734483941629952	754744262449766401	754877947689828352	754999263990419457	755001112176959488	755016798337019908	755020974240563203	755188672517898240	755188669992972289	755216734072832000	755854812743344128	757425369284800512	757602347212242944	761614604879486976	761614828888788992	761677638905716736	761720109882826753	761740571434164224	761792556468350976	761984527250104324	762009379289731072	762009409971036160	762108294219632640	762337642679832576	762364180003303424	762427053853376512	762506351519989762	776449384191930370	776452351360106496	813425275782340608	843945329301098496	843991086137823234	843997023934267392	844171649901457409	844273948263002112	844273947411603457	844273952402825217	844273950796333056	844273950133706752	844273954508320769	844273962519478272	844273986510843904	844273998355714048	844274035017986048	844274082803728384	844274209178054656	844274213280100352	844274211195543552	844274215167574016	844274214748094464	844274220448178178	844274217931554816	844274225732972544	844274224105631744	844274235191148544	844274242657050624	844274246754844672	844274301545021440	844274308637605888	844274307639402496	844274307526094849	844274355261517824	844632065538711553	845014455746412544	845895089218052096	847608603271770112	847610861459881984	847651828883783680	847674405740101633	848006622685405184	848125126390554626	850669665911177217	893622327669346305",fake

politifact15030,https://theglobalheadlines.net/breaking-intel-officer-reveals-obama-could-be-first-president-in-history-to-be-hit-with-a-felony-indictment-2/,Account Suspended,"Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome at the White House on Thursday as the   met Barack Obama for a   private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first stage of a   transition process between Tuesdayâ€™s unexpected election victory and Trumpâ€™s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men discussed â€œforeign and domestic policyâ€ and how to ensure the handover of power went smoothly. â€œI want to emphasise to you, Mr   that we now are going to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,â€ Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity afterwards. A grinning Trump gave Obama a pat on the back as they got up to leave, and boasted to reporters of how long he had just spent in the Oval Office, though the president  â€”   more   until then  â€”   jokingly advised him not to take any questions. While they spoke, Trumpâ€™s wife Melania was shown around their new home in the official residence and East Wing by Michelle Obama, reportedly discussing what it was like to raise children in the White House.  Trump appeared to relish the welcome, though White House officials did not allow photographs of the traditional greeting outside. Obama appeared stiff and subdued throughout. â€œThis was a meeting that was going to last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and we were just going to get to know each other,â€ said Trump in the brief remarks to reporters he gave from an ornate armchair usually occupied by world leaders.  â€œWe had never met each other. I have great respect. The meeting lasted for almost an hour and a half. And it could have  â€”   as far as Iâ€™m concerned, it could have gone on for a lot longer. â€ Asked if he would seek advice from Obama in the future, despite intense criticism from both of them toward the other in the past, Trump described his political opponent as a â€œvery good manâ€. â€œWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties,â€ said the   according to the official White House transcript of their remarks. â€œI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. He explained some of the difficulties, some of the   assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved. â€ Briefing reporters afterwards, press secretary Josh Earnest said he did not know what Trump had meant by â€œ  assetsâ€ and denied the Republicanâ€™s claim that only 10 minutes had originally been scheduled. But he insisted the meeting was â€œa little less awkward than some might have expectedâ€ and tried to explain Obamaâ€™s comment that the meeting had been â€œexcellentâ€. â€œWhen you consider the profound differences between the two gentlemen and the fact they have never met before . .. I think that qualifies as â€˜excellentâ€™,â€ said Earnest. Washington has quickly adopted a deferential approach toward the future    despite widespread demonstrations in major US cities since Tuesdayâ€™s election and reports of an increase in racist attacks aimed at immigrants. As votes from California and other   states on the west coast were slowly processed on Thursday, Clinton was on track to exceed Trumpâ€™s share of the popular vote by 1. 2% fueling concern about the mandate for sweeping change.  Yet there were no protests visible outside the White House in the hour leading up to Trumpâ€™s arrival. One woman with a placard saying â€œstand up to racismâ€ laid it on the ground as she was interviewed by a succession of media crews, though other protesters were expected during the meeting. Instead, the traditional Marine guard stood stiffly outside the West Wing as Trumpâ€™s motorcade swept in from Ronald Reagan airport, where he left his trademark Boeing  . The US Secret Service has announced a temporary   zone for commercial aircraft over Trump Tower in New York, where the   will continue to live for the next few weeks. Trumpâ€™s motorcade arrived on the South Lawn at the White House, which is not visible to journalists or the public. He also refused to allow the usual presence of a pooled media representative with him as he travelled. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump would travel back to New York on Thursday night. In a sharp change of tone, much of the US news media has treated Trump with the respectful approach usually granted to the US head of state when performing ceremonial duties, referring to the   informally as PEOTUS. During the Oval Office meeting, Ivanka Trumpâ€™s husband Jared Kushner  â€”   a likely top aide in the next administration  â€”   was escorted through the Rose Garden by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough.    Joe Biden was due to meet with his successor, Mike Pence, while Trump headed to meet Republican congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill. They have pledged to give him full support in repealing key Democratic legislation such as Obamacare and international climate change accords. Trumpâ€™s election win has already ignited protests across the US, with thousands of demonstrators crowding into streets and surrounding his buildings in major American cities during the first night after the result. The protests  â€”   in cities including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia and Seattle  â€”   erupted after the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, lost the electoral college and presidential race on Tuesday night despite almost certainly winning the popular vote. As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue and marched by Trump Tower, carrying signs that read â€œNot my presidentâ€ â€œShe got more votesâ€ and â€œHands off my pussyâ€ a reference to a leaked recording where Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because of his fame. A number of arrests were made. Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square  â€”   35 blocks downtown  â€”   continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of the  â€™s building. Behind the scenes there is also a bleak mood among many Democrats in the outgoing administration, but officially it has decided to emphasise small signs of progress in the tone adopted by Trump since his victory. â€œI have been very encouraged by the, I think, interest in   Trumpâ€™s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces,â€ said Obama. â€œAnd I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face. â€ The two also had specific conversations about how Obama would handle discussions with foreign leaders on an upcoming overseas trip. They also discussed ways of organising an effective team around the new president to handle future crises. â€œThey spent a large portion of the meeting discussing the importance of properly staffing and organising a White House,â€ Earnest, the press secretary, told reporters after the meeting. He declined to answer questions about whether they discussed Trumpâ€™s promise to unwind much of the outgoing administrationâ€™s achievements over the last eight years. â€œPresident Obama came away from the meeting with renewed confidence in the commitment of the   to ensure a smooth transition,â€ said Earnest. No staff were in the room during the meeting, but Earnest stressed it was unrealistic to expect the meeting to smooth over all that had gone beforehand. â€œI feel confident in telling you that they did not resolve all of their differences, but I also feel confident in telling you that they did not try to resolve all of their differences. â€ He said he was not aware of any additional meeting that has been scheduled but â€œwouldnâ€™t rule out anythingâ€ after Trump spoke of wanting to hear Obamaâ€™s counsel. It is thought the meeting in Washington on Thursday was the only time they have been in same room since Obama ridiculed Trumpâ€™s claims about his birthplace at a White House correspondentsâ€™ dinner in 2011.

After two previous attempts failed, on 16 June Philadelphiaâ€™s city council voted to pass a tax of 1. 5 cents per ounce on both regular and diet soda beverages.  Soda sales and their impact on the epidemic of obesity are a hot topic across the US, and much of the world. Philadelphia is the   city in the US and the largest to successfully pass such a proposal. Only tiny, liberal bastion Berkeley, California, had passed a plan until last week. Since 2008, some 43 other taxes have been proposed in cities and municipalities and all have failed, faced down by the powerful drinksâ€™ lobby. Soda sales are declining  â€”   in the US they soon look set to be outstripped by sales of bottled water. But still 17% of Americans drink soda at least once every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And consumption is higher among black and Hispanic Americans and in southern states, where obesity is also above average.  Experts see Philadelphiaâ€™s success, and the innovative strategy it adopted to get there, as a sign that other cities will soon follow. â€œThis is an important harbinger of what is going to come and people in Philadelphia will see this as important part of their history,â€ predicted Kelly Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, who is an advocate of the soda tax. Historically, the idea for a soda tax first came up in the context of improving health, Brownell said. But initiatives that focused on the tax as a means to cut consumption for health reasons have met with derision and failed. Americans donâ€™t like being told what to do and the soda lobby has used that to its advantage. Recasting the tax as a budget issue, as Philadelphiaâ€™s mayor Jim Kenney did, has proved more palatable. The tax, which is projected to bring in $91m in the first year, will be used to pay for expanding   as well as improving parks, libraries and recreation centers. Philadelphia has high fixed costs which made it difficult to find revenue to pay for expanding   in the city, explains Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Kenney. The mayor did not want to raise property taxes again, said Hitt, so the soda tax was settled on as an alternative revenue source to help fund   expansion. David Goldberg, spokesman for Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda tax initiatives, predicts that San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, California as well as Boulder, Colorado, will all pass similar taxes this year in the wake of Philadelphiaâ€™s success. A number of other cities are now in the primary stages of considering the tax as well, he adds. The American Beverage Association (ABA) the lobbying group for soda manufacturers, which strongly opposes the tax, has said it will â€œtake legal action to stop itâ€ according to spokeswoman Lauren Kane. The ABA has referred to the tax as â€œregressiveâ€ and â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ noting that â€œsimilar tax proposals have been rejected 43 times across the country in the past eight years, including twice in Philadelphiaâ€. A tax can be regressive if a larger percentage of a poor personâ€™s income goes into acquiring an item, or a lower income bracket is taxed at a higher rate than a higher income bracket. Philadelphia feels confident about its legal standing, said Hitt, noting that the cityâ€™s lawyers vetted the proposal and addressed all the arguments that the ABA has raised. The US has many regressive taxes, and being regressive alone does not make a tax impermissible, explained Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting, citing examples of other regressive taxes such as tobacco and alcohol taxes which impact the poor disproportionately more than the better off. Goldberg argues that it makes sense that a tax that impacts poorer communities, would also be the one that benefits those communities by expanding early education for children. It was a smart policy decision by Philadelphiaâ€™s mayor to â€œcarve out some of the industry profits that have come out of poor communities primarily and put them back into the community to benefit the future prospect of kids in those poorer communitiesâ€ Goldberg said. Other legal arguments raised include those around Pennsylvaniaâ€™s constitution, which has a uniformity clause. The uniformity clause means all items in a certain class must be taxed at the same rate, so for example all real estate, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial is taxed at the same rate. So if a tax is imposed, all beverages, including bottled water, could be seen as one class. Sweetened beverages, Hitt argues, are a distinct class because of their negative health effects. The case could â€œfor sureâ€ go to court and may take a couple of years to resolve, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. In the meantime, the ABA would seek a stay pending litigation, which it may or may not be granted, explains Briffault. Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014. Soda consumption in Berkeley was already low before the tax. The ABA did not challenge Berkeleyâ€™s soda tax, underscoring the impact Philadelphiaâ€™s tax is expected to have on similar measures in other cities. â€œIf the Philly tax didnâ€™t mean anything, the soda industry would not have plunked more than $4m into fighting it and promised more in implied bribes,â€ says Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. While Philadelphia works to implement its tax, which is slated to go into effect in January 2017, other cities are taking note of its successful strategy. â€œThere is great public support for tax funds earmarked for social purposes,â€ says Nestle. Focusing on soda taxes as a revenue source also brings â€œa whole other group of political figures to the mixâ€ points out Brownell. Previously, only politicians focused on health would get involved with soda tax proposals, but the new strategy brings in politicians who are looking for new revenue generating possibilities for projects for their constituents, explains Brownell. â€œMy guess is that the floodgates will open pretty quickly, Brownell says.",317,444,"1017445961532968961	1017446502363377664	1017446594277466113	1017449514855264256	1017451011173244928	1017463614310150144	1017494125942398979	1017509276070232064	1017587229319782401	1017617237438615552	1017639875926024193	1017643438056005633	1017762638825172993	1017774641962733569	1017808664936304640	1017871560307339271	1017899925445758977	1018031957937197058	1018041280843087872	1018236518974906368	1018298803638669312	1018499396516941825	1018921728410468352	1019974057809326080",fake
politifact15404,https://dailyworldupdate.us/2018/05/18/breaking-santa-fe-killer-confesses-his-love-for-obama/,BREAKING: Santa Fe Killer Confesses His Love For Obama,"Americaâ€™s standing in the eyes of many Europeans has been dealt an immense blow by this weekâ€™s election. The magnetic effect of the US on Europe has always been drawn from the strength of its values  â€”   tolerance, individual rights, democracy  â€”   arguably more so than its cultural symbols, Hollywood movies,   or the iPhone. With the election of Donald Trump, a man who has declared heâ€™s in favour of torture and killing the families of terrorist offenders, and who shows admiration for autocrats, many Europeans woke up on 9 November feeling that the America they admire had been taken from them. America was never perfect by any means. No democracy is. But the erosion of Americaâ€™s image as a democracy capable of underwriting a shared liberal world order, combined with the worst instincts this risks amplifying within Europeâ€™s own political discourse, represents the biggest threat to the west as we have known it in the last seven decades. Itâ€™s a fair bet that Angela Merkel, an East German and Europeâ€™s most powerful and respected leader today, immediately felt the daunting contrast between two 9 Novembers  â€”   one the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, full of hope, the other, when Trump sealed his victory, full of anxiety. Back in 1989, when joyful crowds broke through the wall, the symbol of Europeâ€™s division and the oppression of entire nations, Merkel went to Berlinâ€™s Bornholmer Strasse crossing to the west. As a politician, Merkel has often spoken of the importance of American values to her personally, and to Europe. In 2009 she gave a speech to the US Congress  â€”   the first German chancellor to do so since Konrad Adenauer in 1957  â€”   in which she spoke of her â€œenthusiasmâ€ for â€œthe American dreamâ€ where â€œthe air is full of the spirit of freedomâ€. So it was no surprise that this 9 November, her first reaction to Trumpâ€™s election was so calibrated and forceful. She listed the â€œcommon valuesâ€ that bind Germany and the US together: â€œDemocracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views. â€ She then added: â€œIt is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation. â€ It was a remarkable statement, one that no other German chancellor has ever had to make  â€”   or indeed felt obliged to. In essence, Merkel set conditions on cooperation with the US president. She seemed to put values before the question of alliances  â€”   or at least, to rank them just as highly. And this, coming from the leader of a country whose very democracy and institutions are historically owed to Americaâ€™s postwar political engineering in Europe. I can think of no other example of a German leader taking the United States so openly and bluntly to task on the question of respecting values. Well, actually, there is a one precedent: in 2006, when Merkel first travelled to Washington as chancellor, she made a point of criticising GuantÃ¡namo, calling for the campâ€™s closure and for respect for rule of law, before meeting with George W Bush. Merkel is well aware that if today the US enters a dark and unfathomable era of illiberalism, the fallout in Europe will be immense, and the foundations of the European project, already badly shaken, will be in even greater danger. She acted last year as a guardian of the principle of international asylum. And she is deeply concerned about the risk of France being swept away by the Marine Le Pen phenomenon. Now, she is calling for Europeâ€™s powerful ally to be true to the essence of transatlantic bonds: values, not just institutions, military hardware or trade. If the US is no longer able to give the right cues, those in Europe who want to save whatever can be saved of liberal democracy find themselves   and weakened. Equally, if America cares no longer for the values that are meant to be enshrined in the EU project, then Europeâ€™s capacity to show resilience in the face of forces that want it dismantled is instantly diminished. It only takes one look at the way European demagogues and extremists have applauded Trumpâ€™s election, and another look at how it was greeted in Moscow, to know this problem of perception, the question of Americaâ€™s image and its link with Europe, is essential. There is of course much speculation about Donald Trumpâ€™s foreign policy. No doubt, his rhetoric has been worrying. But there are as yet more unknowns than knowns. What we do know for certain is that Trumpâ€™s success has wrecked the notion that the American nation wholeheartedly stands for the values of liberal democracy. And this is happening at time when those values are being increasingly questioned in Europe. Trump has cast a dark shadow on Americaâ€™s reputation, adding to the blow suffered by liberal values as a result of Britainâ€™s referendum. This is why the dread felt now by so many Europeans is as overwhelming as the excitement and optimism which seized everyone on that other 9 November, 27 years ago: 1989 was not just a victory for Europeans but a victory for America and its values. The US had not only guaranteed the security of western European countries since the second world war, it had played a crucial role in consolidating democracy and reconciliation. There simply would never have been a European project, without Americaâ€™s engagement and interest. If there is now a threat hanging over the west, it comes first and foremost from the danger that this psychological and political link with America might break. This disappointment is arguably bigger than fears that Nato defence guarantees might evaporate overnight. This is why, on the day after Americaâ€™s election, Merkel was right to speak of values rather than of alliances. She, very likely, had that 9 November anniversary in mind.",752,175,"933535990907658240	933601911156047872	933777652397363205	933857715989958656	933935159568687104	934050125655216128	934252985894555648	934474972784943109	936201861182271488	942511347253866496	942536227433209858	944545955793326080	985852136385863681	986361323582836737	986851128489971713	986986064622637062	987067559152443394	987079679998865409	987091520485560320	987108005362720768	987112521667661824	987139471694008320	987162161825935360	987191845397688320	987212625468641280	987319859817209862	987335196763672577	987357590274433025	987370742953242625	987372256316837890	987418936684793856	987436546675666944	987466736248217600	987943797320486913	988070450407362560	988080055355166725	988104140759986178	988181119987339265	988186149825982464	988203188884070400	988347524556705792	988404217458110465	988971885286363137	1013490253003481088",fake
politifact13559,http://politicono.com/pence-michelle-obama-vulgar-first-lady-weve-ever/,Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had”,"The subject of the popular podcast Serial is getting a second chance to try to prove his innocence, after a judge granted the manâ€™s request for a retrial last week. But heâ€™s just one of thousands of criminal defendants in America hoping to clear their names. Adnan Syed, the    subject of Serial, was convicted of the murder of his   Hae Min Lee after she was found strangled to death in 1999. Last week, judge Martin Welch granted Syedâ€™s request for a retrial and vacated his conviction. Syed had served more than 16 years of a life sentence before Thursdayâ€™s ruling, and his attorney has said that he might seek bail for Syed so that he can be released from prison before the proceedings continue.  The specifics of Leeâ€™s death, and the evidence implicating Syed, have been subject to intense scrutiny thanks to the attention brought by Serial and the additional investigations it spawned. But Syed is one among scores of criminal defendants who say theyâ€™ve been wrongfully convicted and are now working from behind bars to prove their innocence. Since 1989, the National Registry of Exonerations has tracked more than 1, 830 exonerations in the US, a number the registry estimates to be a â€œfractionâ€ of the total exonerations in that time period. The Guardian looked at five of the many cases across the country in which criminal defendants are seeking retrials or other recourse to clear their names. The original case: Danny Lee Hill was found guilty of multiple charges in the brutal beating and death of a    boy in Warren, Ohio. The boy died two days after he was beaten and raped in September 1985. Timothy Combs, then 17, was also found guilty in the attack. Length of imprisonment: Hill was sentenced to death in 1986, and he has waited in prison through the ongoing appeals process since then. Cause for review: When Hill, 49, was originally convicted, prosecutors said that bite marks had been found on the boyâ€™s penis and brought an oral surgeon to testify that the marks had come from Hillâ€™s teeth. The alleged bite marks were the only physical evidence presented by the prosecution that tied Hill to the crime, according to his attorney Vicki Werneke.  Since then, the scientific consensus around bite marks has shifted dramatically to acknowledge the imprecision behind   science. Hillâ€™s attorneys said they are questioning the admissibility of both the   science used to convict Hill and the confession that the    gave. They added that they plan to present testimony on the unreliability of   evidence in general as well as from a   expert who says the marks werenâ€™t made by human teeth. Whatâ€™s next: Hillâ€™s attorneys are pursuing multiple paths toward a retrial, and the state has scheduled hearings for September to determine whether there is sufficient new evidence to grant a retrial. The original case: Johnson was convicted of assault on a   death and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Johnson, a licensed daycare provider in San Diego, was arrested after an infant in her care hit her head, and later stopped breathing and died. Authorities said Johnson intentionally abused and aggressively shook the child because she was angry when the    wouldnâ€™t stop crying Johnson said that the baby suffered an accidental fall from a high chair. Length of imprisonment: Johnson, 71, has been behind bars since she was found guilty in 1999. Cause for review: Johnson is among of slew of criminal defendants convicted in cases of   â€œshaken baby syndromeâ€ a controversial diagnosis for young children injured as a result of forceful shaking. The medical consensus around shaken baby syndrome and childhood head trauma has evolved since Johnsonâ€™s conviction, calling into question her case and many others in which prosecutors alleged childrenâ€™s fatal injuries were caused by intentional abuse. New research suggests that shaken baby syndrome has been over diagnosed and has spurred intense debate over what actually indicates a case of shaken baby syndrome. Johnsonâ€™s attorneys say the childâ€™s, Whatâ€™s next: Johnson is one of 12 defendants for whom the California Innocence Project is asking Governor Jerry Brown to grant clemency. In January, a judge said that Johnson could seek a retrial. The original case: Nathaniel Epps was convicted of rape and other violent crimes with his    Percell Warren in a 1996 attack of a woman in Norfolk, Virginia. Prosecutors said Epps and Warren broke into the womanâ€™s home and raped her at gunpoint before beating her with the pistol. Length of imprisonment: Epps, 53, has served 20 years of a   sentence. Warren died from lung cancer in prison in 2012. Cause for review: Newly tested DNA evidence exonerates both men, according to the Innocence Project. Sperm from two men was found on the victimâ€™s jeans, and Warrenâ€™s DNA was not found in the mixture. Although Eppsâ€™s couldnâ€™t be definitively excluded from the mixture, his lawyers say the evidence exonerates him because of the stateâ€™s theory that Warren and Epps committed the crime together. â€œDNA results excluding at least one of the defendants as the source of the sperm proves that they are both actually innocent,â€ Eppsâ€™s lawyers wrote in a brief presenting the evidence. Whatâ€™s next: The Innocence Project is petitioning the Virginia supreme court for Eppsâ€™s full exoneration. His lawyers submitted a petition to the court on 21 June presenting the new DNA evidence and seeking a writ of innocence. The state attorney generalâ€™s office has 30 days to respond. The original case: Prosecutors said Vinson raped a    girl in her bedroom after breaking into her Detroit home through a window. Length of imprisonment: Vinson has been in prison since May 1986 and is serving a   to   sentence. Cause for review: Vinsonâ€™s legal team at the University of Michigan Innocence Clinic say that newly available DNA testing rule him out as a possible suspect in the rape. Attorney Andrew Fletcher said a new analysis of the semen found at the crime scene definitively showed that Vinson couldnâ€™t have been the attacker. Blood cells in the semen found on sheets at the crime scene show that the attacker was blood type O Vinson is blood type AB. The original case: Contreras and his friend Scott Taylor were convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole in 1997. Prosecutors charged the pair with killing Frederick Walker at a barbecue in Santa Clarita, California. Walkerâ€™s beaten body was found dismembered and in trash bags by police. Length of imprisonment: Contreras has been in prison for 19 years. Cause for review: Contreras and Taylor were convicted after a woman at the barbecue told police that both men were responsible for Walkerâ€™s brutal death, in line with authoritiesâ€™ theory that two killers were responsible. In 2009, the woman, Lisa Garringer, recanted her original testimony and later testified that Taylor was the only person involved involved in Walkerâ€™s death. Garringer said she had been coerced by police investigators into implicating both men. Whatâ€™s next: After Garringerâ€™s new testimony, a Los Angeles superior court judge refused to reverse Contrerasâ€™s conviction, saying he did not find her to be a credible witness. His lawyers at the California Innocence Project say they will continue to seek relief through the courts but that their clientâ€™s best hope for release is through clemency from the governor.",482,616,"702223304711663616	702224356898803713	702227353561333761	702233743818264578	702234290982141952	702235139879919620	702235632605786117	702237277628588032	702238157585035264	702240356033662976	702250649224806400	702250648130207745	702251106454282240	702253984053067777	702273712771305472	702292417987399682	702333792044777474	702334287740166144	702335457154068480	702367547568611330	702531159532548097	702542831970177024	702547560817401857	702551216665010176	702619682893864960	702636315943133184	702667615366283264	702691613559009280	702960845312155652	703049928361295872	703169412149305344	703174607709155329	703286374842011648	703287058870063104	703337608542330881	703380119725940736	703390805277409280	703417814888157184	703448329821298688	703584231805485056	703585164711038976	703586398499160064	703601208393601024	703613578583154688	703647286128205825	703658892794818560	703660139010723841	703660152264777728	703682176748019712	703703284708728832	703712672366219264	703713019398897664	703808456101244928	703846046384828417	703874595720265728	703903400493248512	703926544817741824	703931094752763905	703940077018189824	703955633087733760	703957124796260352	703961287320051714	703966632272654336	703989588226936832	703997505915105280	704021574727417856	704024213917704197	704063762500870144	704101210803085312	704103713707847681	704120991941828609	704137278675918848	704226255630106624	704331926161612800	704368951384346624	704394394804293632	704514427249233921	705054587305271297	705626433251479555	708021431477608448	709020325879615488	712303871171948544	712303870500741120	712454379652161536	712468691460329472	712501407320936448	712512994933080064	712820711442759680	712843197169315842	713083573297766400	714167898055581698	714167913415057412	714181770070134785	714194240448892933	715864022441201664	719550471975731200	719552197684523010	719572536913055744	719586223027654657	719611158408204288	719618462264516610	719632065977712640	719713610814132224	719740446331658240	719750349200977920	719751412784238592	719789448817278976	719829838408736768	720343338453377025	720710831181148160	720953094280974336	721002182661840896	721183828086231041	721728121162956800	722196349219926016	722321659898814464	724098618773397504	764172420617900032	771826874389438464	773362265303244800	773555921545007104	775350186403065856	775377403497451520	775850898773815296	776481987062276097	776519345149063168	777100317993406465	777159735044898816	777280916502622208	777343147189886976	777548214035746817	777662604328087552	779969520647626752	782626863499898880	782748521879396352	782748666620616704	782749966032928768	782750753995694080	782778691155693568	782789097962278912	782954604317204480	782982034708979712	782988432314212353	783009895515688960	783376496559808512	785013005566222337	785013468097306624	785019713017540608	785137783677542400	785152347278376961	785325895061954560	785421054298714112	785527768314318848	785640746296631296	786671369916391429	789071384681017344	792770261762310144	793499294795870208	793527855682621440	793542506390491136	793579315032125444	793630126835589120	793642050071789569	793643514936582144	793656258972844033	793675182812438532	793787673039233024	793792333720453120	793928474868129792	793935117777371136	793970791205322752	793970904808071168	794042196559360000	794046100285968385	794125441564971009	794186073035440128	794198704492253186	794254617316130816	795336406361141248	798680709204496385	802391196651945984	806699089458909184	806919503137251328	815574349151371264	824731051067142145	836014552127057920	839481475959558145	840930930755788800	873510530186608640	878206022350917632	878207043689222144	878207597781929988	879187821692674048	879188763267739648	879189325405192193	879192960566472705	879202569792442369	879202751519043584	879203659502014465	879304040118714368	879456378279960580	879516087007797250	887580412733784064	897352601632722944	897353453843959812	897353769066868736	897385807048302593	897399239499796480	897427683143028741	897430008930717696	912840490869026817	919774911165448193	919775182646071296	919775458698383360	919776197130833920	919776727957692416	919779234570231809	919940558298189824	920284496540430337	941684099588198400	941685202732109824	941686621262446593	942020936269750272	944179739043999745	986846879278301184	986846906793037824	986847443558989824	986936164073566209	986951792339628034	986988606077235206	987019899653492738	987022236312842241	987096591004852226	987102033537896450	987103517440659458	987130395387879424	987167189743620097	987172537112162304	987284511304986624	987381735221547008	987403193096310787	987438996530913281	987442603158396929	987672258930987008	987672458076610562	987673831035748352	987699692195676166	987849313429741568	987877135468638208	987916947890343936	988140163611185154	988140861191086091	988169793885933568	988201755262545920	988208053861396480	988248751016890368	988358264483205120	991319110616322056	1001704782225166336	1001704800763904005	1001704952996286464	100171356867132621

Shortly after the FBI announced Julyâ€™s figures on Monday afternoon, shares in the second largest gun manufacturer hit $30. 59 each. Smith  Wessonâ€™s shares closed the day at an   high of $30. 36, up 3% for the day and beating a previous record high of $29. 37 set in March. Shares in Sturm Ruger, the USâ€™s largest gun maker, also surged on the news, ending the day up 2% at $69. 40. A total of 2, 197, 169 firearms background checks were processed last month, according to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Thatâ€™s up from 1, 600, 832 background checks processed in July 2015 and 891, 224 checks processed in July 2008, months before Barack Obama was elected president.  Firearms background checks are not the most accurate measure of gun sales, as not every background check results in a purchase. Additionally, multiple firearms can be purchased with one background check. The figure is, however, used to gauge the demand for firearms and the health of the market.  The demand for firearms in the US has been on the rise, fuelled by fears of a crackdown on ownership in the wake of a series of mass shootings. July was the 15th month in a row that a new record has been set for that particular time of the year. The   high was reached in December of 2015, right after the San Bernardino terrorist attack that left 14 dead and 22 injured. That month, 3, 314, 594 firearms background checks were performed. Earlier this year, Smith  Wesson announced that its annual profits reached $293. 8m, a 50% increase on last yearâ€™s figures.

The South Korean company recalled 2. 5m phones last week following reports that some units had caught fire during or after charging. One    from New York was reportedly using a Galaxy Note 7 to watch videos on Saturday when it burst into flames, causing burns to his body.  His grandmother Linda Lewis told the New York Post: â€œHe doesnâ€™t want to see or go near any phones. Heâ€™s been crying to his mother. â€ Samsung has said that battery problems are responsible for the explosions but that it cannot be sure at this stage which of the phones it has sold are affected. In a statement the company introduced a product exchange program that allows all owners to trade their devices for a new one.  â€œWe strongly advise all customers to use this exchange program because your safety is our top priority. Additional sales and shipments of the affected devices have been stopped, but if you already have a Galaxy Note 7, we strongly advise that you replace it. â€ â€œUntil a replacement device is provided, Samsung asks all customers with a Galaxy Note 7 smartphone to power down your device and return it to its place of purchase at your earliest opportunity,â€ the statement added. Users who donâ€™t follow Samsungâ€™s recommendations may find their device, which only launched last month, remotely deactivated. Unconfirmed reports stemming from a Reddit thread have suggested that Samsung will brick affected Note 7s starting as soon as 30 September. Smartphones typically have a remote kill switch to deter   thieves. As a safety measure, airlines across the US started to warn passengers to avoid switching on or charging their Note 7s during flights, in line with advice from the Federal Aviation Authority. Customers can trade their Galaxy Note 7 for a new version of the smartphone that isnâ€™t faulty or they can choose a different model of smartphone, including the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, and receive a refund for the price difference between devices. To sweeten the inconvenience, Samsung is also issuing US customers with a $25 gift card. The companyâ€™s share price has plummeted in response to the recall.  Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.

politifact14788,http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-isis-barron-obama/,"Melania Trump: ‘If ISIS Lay A Finger On Barron, I’ll Scratch Obama’s Eyes Out’","Donald Trump has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration. The Republican presidential candidate doubled down on his hardline stance in a speech on Wednesday night which delighted core supporters and dismayed his few remaining Latino allies who had expected a tack towards moderation. Speaking hours after a lightning visit to Mexico, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, he was sticking with his plan for a â€œdeportation forceâ€ to intercept illegal border crossers and hunt down criminal â€œillegal aliensâ€ already in the US. â€œWe are going to take our country back,â€ he said, repeating a mantra from the primary campaign. Speaking largely from a teleprompter, he also reiterated his vow to make Mexico pay for a   wall which, he said, would bristle with sensors, towers and guards. â€œWe will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They donâ€™t know it yet, but theyâ€™re going to pay for it. â€ Trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls with just 69 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides had recently fuelled expectations of a â€œsofteningâ€ of immigration policy, prompting speculation about a  . Instead the speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City, where Trump met President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. The GOP nominee roused the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage â€œangel momsâ€ whose children were killed. He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gives work permits to about 800, 000 young immigrants who came to the US as children  â€”   a stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach. Anybody who entered the US illegally would be subject to deportation and there should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, he said. â€œThere will be no amnesty. â€ Trump also promised ideological tests for   visa applicants, a â€œsunsetâ€ on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years and a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that donâ€™t deport undocumented immigrants. The rhetoric trampled over the hopes of Trumpâ€™s dwindling band of conservative Latino supporters. â€œThis is how I feel: disappointed and misled,â€ tweeted Alfonso Aguilar, head of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. Jacob Monty, a member of Trumpâ€™s National Hispanic advisory council, resigned, Politico reported. The rightwing columnist Ann Coulter, in contrast, exulted. â€œWow. This doesnâ€™t sound like â€œsoftening. â€ GO, TRUMP! !!â€ she tweeted. Trump did however imply most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would remain untouched while his putative administration focused on deporting 2 million with alleged criminal records. â€œWe will begin moving them out, day one. My first hour in office, those people are gone. â€ The ambiguity over the fate of   undocumented immigrants marked a tacit retreat from Trumpâ€™s earlier vows to swiftly deport all 11 million people. The lack of clarity allowed supporters and critics to fill in the blanks with their own wishes and anxieties. Trumpâ€™s policy could in theory yet resemble that of Obama, who has deported millions, and GOP rivals such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, whom Trump accused of supporting de facto amnesty. The speech capped a whirlwind day of political theatre in which Trump, after a year of denigrating Mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and drug dealers, met President PeÃ±a Nieto in Mexico City, triggering a backlash from Mexicans who denounced the New York businessman as a tyrant, and worse. Trump emerged from the private meeting at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, heaping praise on Mexican immigrants. â€œThey are amazing people, amazing people . .. Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular and hardworking people. â€ He said the   meeting with PeÃ±a Nieto was â€œsubstantiveâ€ and â€œexcellentâ€ but did not touch on his pledge to force Mexico to pay for the wall. â€œWeâ€™re saving that discussion for a later date. â€ Mexicoâ€™s president however said he did broach the topic and told Trump Mexico would not pay. In a late evening television interview, an   PeÃ±a Nieto said: â€œHis policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing. â€œThat risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations. â€  Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, sidelined by another day of Trump drama, seized on the discrepancy: â€œIt turns out Trump didnâ€™t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. â€ The unexpected visit  â€”   Trumpâ€™s first meeting with a head of state since he became a candidate  â€”   yielded presidential optics in the form of a podium and marble backdrop in an international setting. Speaking beneath a Mexican flag the casino   reality TV star sounded restrained and diplomatic. That evaporated when he bounded onto the podium in Phoenix, 200 miles north of the border, and seemed energised by the crowd, even though the cavernous convention centre was  . â€œThere is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that is the wellbeing of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. â€ The audience cheered and chanted â€œUSAâ€. Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, a controversial hunter of suspected undocumented people, New Yorkâ€™s former mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trumpâ€™s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, warmed up the crowd before Trump arrived.  Supporters hailed his   foray as evidence he could negotiate with foreign leaders and secure US interests. George Buchanan, 71, a retired flooring installer, said it also showed courage. â€œItâ€™s dangerous. Youâ€™ve got those Mexican people over there, drug lords. The drug lords donâ€™t want him to build the wall. â€ Some in the crowd sensed that behind the brash reiteration of mass deportations Trump was in fact edging towards a more moderate, viable, policy. â€œI think heâ€™s loosening up, becoming more realistic,â€ said Nancy Lewis, 56, a retired law enforcer. â€œAnd Iâ€™m OK with that. I have Hispanic friends. â€ Michelle Des Marais, 78, appeared willing to forgive Trump if he did end up retreating. â€œItâ€™s a hard fight but at least heâ€™s trying. â€",414,942,"933768952169168896	933770606755053573	933843649657475072	933843698785423360	933932573671153664	934005992026791936	934911980397322241	934912098236329984",fake

Just as pet owners wonder what their pets do all day while theyâ€™re out, pets are baffled as to what their human masters and mistresses find to occupy themselves with during this mysterious time of â€œworkâ€. Max (voiced by Louis CK) is a terrier who is outraged when his owner brings home a new rescue dog that he must now live with: Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet).

politifact14247,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-of-american-moon-landings/,Chinese Lunar Rover Finds No Evidence Of American Moon Landings,"Val Aubrey parked her boat trailer on the shore of Eagle Lake, in   California. She walked to an overlook where a sign warned against swimming and diving. â€œThisâ€  â€”   she opened her arms wide  â€”   â€œused to be the marina. â€ Down below, docks sat among nettles and thistles growing on what used to be the lake bed. The boat ramp led to sunbaked dirt, and squirrels skittered across the concrete.  â€œThey put a tombstone right in the middle of it,â€ said Aubrey, pointing into the undergrowth. Sure enough, a small Halloween decoration had been erected in the former harbor. One of the largest natural lakes in the state, Eagle Lake is a shock of blue amid a tawny, isolated upland. But it has fallen around 15ft since 1999, a decline thought to have been exacerbated by climate change. The main lakeside community of Spalding, a   drive north of the marina, is dotted with â€œfor saleâ€ signs, and its tidy streets are empty. The waterfront is now a meadow, and the lake has receded to a thin strip in the distance, like an alluring mirage. There are no longer any restaurants, and the general store is shuttered. Adding to the air of misfortune, dozens of the wells that supply residents with water have gone dry, necessitating deeper ones. The hardships facing the lake stand in contrast to its reputation as a fishery. According to the outdoors writer Tom Stienstra, â€œIt was among the most prized lakes in America. â€  Its main attraction is the indigenous Eagle Lake rainbow trout, whose   meat is said to be uncommonly delicious. Anglers continue to land big, healthy fish. But half as many of them are visiting, in part because only one boat ramp on the entire,    lake is still operational. â€œGimme water, lord,â€ said Aubrey, a    with a   vibe and a cigarette crackle in her voice. â€œI think thatâ€™s the thought of everyone round here. â€ In the shadow of the disused marina, she backed her trailer down the ramp and into the glassy shallows as chub minnows darted away. There was a thump as the wheels dropped onto the mud at the end, a sign of how close the structure is to being unusable. Aubrey undid some clips, and her   Dream Catcher, floated onto the lake. Chugging out, it was hard to tell that anything was amiss. The unruffled water stretched to sere,   hills and a cloudless sky. White pelicans cruised past like ungainly swans. Grebes emitted tinkling chirps and chuckles, and pairs of them performed a courtship dance in which they lifted themselves off the surface and appeared to run across it. When the boat approached, they dove underwater instead of flying away. Once a fishing guide, Aubrey wore enamel earrings in the shape of trout. â€œThereâ€™s more to Eagle Lake than just fishing,â€ she said. â€œOur hearts are here. Our souls are here. â€ Even so, spurs of dry land have appeared where previously there was none. Aubrey pulled into the lee of a sand bar that had gradually risen out of the waves. â€œBefore this area was above water, this was just black with grebes,â€ she said. Last year, some vast northern sections of the lake almost dried up completely, only to be regenerated, to a certain extent, by the winter rains. They were still too shallow for Dream Catcher.  Back at the marina, operated by a couple named Grace and Scott McCullough, it was lunchtime. With vacationers perusing snacks and fishing lures in the large,   shop, and hot food on offer from a trailer, it felt like the vacation spot that Eagle Lake prides itself on being. Sitting in the storeroom, Grace ticked off some theories sheâ€™d heard to explain the low water. Perhaps someone had bought the rights to the aquifer and was secretly draining it. Maybe   at a neighboring lake was leaving them with less moisture. As she sees it, the decline is part of a normal cycle. Itâ€™s true that California is prone to drought, and Eagle Lakeâ€™s level, determined primarily by precipitation, has oscillated over the decades. Its longtime historic low was in the 1930s, though in 2015 it went lower. At a picnic table outside, there was skepticism as to whether Eagle Lake was at the vanguard of a more ominous,   global shift. â€œIâ€™m not an    believer that we can adjust the climate of this earth that much,â€ said Scott McCullough, a retired marine. â€œI agree with Scott,â€ said Lee Crane, a   dentist from Sacramento, who was eating burgers at the other end of the table with his wife, Dottie. â€œYou could take all the diesel stacks in the United States and let â€˜em go and the earth wouldnâ€™t know the difference, in my opinion. â€ Bobette Jones, an ecologist with the Eagle Lake ranger district, sees it differently. With less snow falling in the area, there is less snowmelt to recharge the watershed, while more dry months each year mean increased evaporation. â€œI think thereâ€™s a pretty strong trend that the lake is definitely going to be much more shallow in the future,â€ she said by telephone. â€œItâ€™s sort of a    and   story, but that is what the data is showing. Hopefully weâ€™re wrong. â€ As evening approached, boat mechanic James Watts was stood in the weedy lot of his repair shop in Spalding. â€œOn opening morning, Iâ€™d have boats lined up down the street,â€ he said, referring to the start of the fishing season. â€œNow as you see there ainâ€™t no boats around here. â€ Watts fell for Eagle Lake on a fishing trip, and his family built the shop over 20 years ago. In 2013, he was forced to move the business to a nearby town, where there was more money to be made. All around him were the   boats he was saving for spares and others he was storing for acquaintances. Almost the only sound was the shushing of wind through the trees. â€œWe watched the water level go and every year it was like, donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll come back, itâ€™ll come back. And three years ago was when it actually turned and went to nothing. â€ Wearing a grimy work shirt bearing his name, Watts lit a cigarette, leaned against one of the hulls, and stared into space.

politifact15232,daily-vine.com/cnn-pulls-plug/,WHOA! YouTube Witness Makes SHOCKING Admission On LIVE TV! CNN PULLS PLUG IMMEDIATELY! — ShareRED,"The Chilcot inquiry has delivered a damning verdict on the decision by former prime minister Tony Blair to commit British troops to the   invasion of Iraq in 2003. It says: Chilcot is withering about Blairâ€™s choice to join the US invasion. He says: â€œWe have concluded that the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. Military action at that time was not a last resort. â€ Chilcot finds that Blair deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by the Iraqi regime as he sought to make the case for military action to MPs and the public in the buildup to the invasion in 2002 and 2003. The then prime minister disregarded warnings about the potential consequences of military action, and relied too heavily on his own beliefs, rather than the more nuanced judgments of the intelligence services. â€œThe judgments about Iraqâ€™s capabilities . .. were presented with a certainty that was not justified,â€ the report says. Tony Blair wrote to George W Bush eight months before the Iraq invasion to offer his unqualified backing for war well before UN weapons inspectors had complete their work, saying: â€œI will be with you, whatever. â€ In a   memo marked secret and personal, the then British prime minister told Bush, US president at the time, in July 2002 that the removal of Saddam Hussein would â€œfree up the regionâ€ even if Iraqis may â€œfeel ambivalent about being invadedâ€. It was one of 29 letters Blair sent to Bush in the   to the Iraq war, during the conflict and in its devastating aftermath, released on Wednesday as part of the Chilcot report. Chilcot finds that the decision made by Tony Blairâ€™s cabinetâ€™s to invade was made in circumstances that were â€œfar from satisfactoryâ€. The inquiry did not reach a view on the legality of the war, saying this could only be assessed by a â€œproperly constituted and internationally recognised courtâ€ but did make a damning assessment of how the decision was made. The process for deciding that the war was legal is described as â€œperfunctoryâ€ by the inquiry, while â€œno formal record was made of that decision, and the precise grounds on which it was made remains unclearâ€. The inquiry found that the Bush administration repeatedly   advice from the UK on how to oversee Iraq after the invasion, including the involvement of the United Nations, the control of Iraqi oil money and the extent to which better security should be put at the heart of the military operation. The inquiry specifically criticises the way in which the US dismantled the security apparatus of the Saddam Hussein army and describes the whole invasion as a strategic failure. Iran, North Korea and Libya were considered greater threats in terms of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation, and the UK joint intelligence committee believed it would take Iraq five years, after the lifting of sanctions, to produce enough fissile material for a weapon, Chilcot finds. Britainâ€™s previous strategy of containment could have been adopted and continued for some time. The Chilcot report identifies a series of major blunders by the British intelligence services that produced â€œflawedâ€ information about Saddamâ€™s alleged weapons of mass destruction, the basis for going to war. Chilcot says the intelligence community worked from the start on the misguided assumption that Saddam had WMDs and made no attempt to consider the possibility that he had got rid of them, which he had. The UKâ€™s military involvement in Iraq ended with the â€œhumiliatingâ€ decision to strike deals with enemy militias because British forces were seriously   and there was â€œwholly inadequateâ€ planning and preparation for life after Saddam Hussein, the Chilcot report finds. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) planned the invasion in a rush and was slow to react to the security threats on the ground, particularly the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that killed so many troops, the report says. Chilcot rejects the view that the UK would have lost diplomatic influence if it had refused to join the war. â€œBlair was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider alliance with the US very carefully,â€ the report says. But it adds: â€œIf the UK had refused to join the US in the war it would not have led to a fundamental or lasting change in the UKâ€™s relationship with the US. â€ The report says that between early 2002 and March 2003 Blair was told that,   Iraq could degenerate into civil war. In September 2002, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, predicted â€œa terrible bloodletting of revenge after Saddam goesâ€ adding: â€œTraditional in Iraq after conflict. â€ Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador to the US, added: â€œIt will probably make pacifying Afghanistan look like childâ€™s play. â€ Chilcot rejects Blairâ€™s claim that the subsequent chaos and sectarian conflict could not have been predicted. According to Chilcot, Blair did not identify which ministers were responsible for postwar planning and strategy. The prime minister also failed to press Bush for â€œdefinitive assurancesâ€ about the USâ€™s   plans. Nor did he envisage anything other than the   scenario once the invasion was over: that a   and   force would find itself operating in a â€œrelatively benign security environmentâ€. All of this contributed to Britainâ€™s ultimate strategic failure. The Bush administration appointed ambassador Paul Bremer to head a new coalition provisional authority in Baghdad. The UK had practically no input into subsequent decisions taken by Bremer, including the dissolving of Saddamâ€™s army and security structures. This decision alienated the Sunni community and fed the insurgency. Blair continued to talk to Bush, but Britain had little influence on the ground over    policymaking.  Chilcot says that by 2009, when UK forces were pulled out of Iraq, Downing Street was facing strategic failure. Iraq was gripped by â€œdeep sectarian divisionsâ€. There was a fragile situation in Basra, rows over oil revenues, and rampant corruption inside Iraqi government ministries. No evidence had been found that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. During this period the government did not reappraise the situation, Chilcot says. He describes as â€œmeagreâ€ the results of Britainâ€™s costly   occupation. Before the war, Blair had said that the   invasion coalition would try to minimise civilian casualties. As the war and occupation unfolded, however, the MoD made only a â€œbroad estimateâ€ of how many Iraqis were being killed. The report says that more time was devoted to which department should have responsibility for the issue than was spent on finding out the number. The governmentâ€™s main interest was to â€œrebut accusations that coalition forces were responsible for the deaths of large numbersâ€ of Iraqis.",748,479,"981531924417204229	981531935380996097	981533666886242304	981533915692392453	981534821628473344	981540624724733952	981545386400796674	981556667736383493	981567647228801025	981576525102403584	981675342451556352	981677845578645506	982117453776879617	982721646829146113	982749128437452800	983886038463602688	1045480707806572544",fake

The actor, who played Carrie Bradshaw in the hit television comedy and two films, said she and her   from the series had not ruled out reprising their roles. â€œI donâ€™t think any of us have said no,â€ she told the Press Association. â€œI donâ€™t know whether itâ€™s a series or the movie. â€œI think that remains an open question and discussion that will continue until itâ€™s been resolved. â€œI think thatâ€™s always a possibility, definitely. â€ Parker starred alongside Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon in the TV series Sex and the city from 1998 to 2004. The four women reprised their roles for the Sex and the City movie in 2008 and a sequel in 2012. Parker is now starring in a new TV comedy, Divorce, opposite Thomas Haden Church, in which they play a couple whose marriage is breaking down. The show, which will air on Sky Atlantic in the UK, was created by Sharon Horgan, the Irish writer and star of hit Amazon comedy Catastrophe. Parker, who has been married to actor Matthew Broderick for 19 years, said she knew of a couple involved in an affair which lasted â€œmany, many yearsâ€ despite both of them being â€œhappily married peopleâ€. â€œThis affair was sort of like an alternate universe but it wasnâ€™t hurting anybody,â€ she said. â€œI was so curious because I didnâ€™t think it was unique. â€œI hadnâ€™t seen in cinema for a long time, a portrait of a marriage   a   marriage in a lot of ways   that was inhabited by people we all know and see on the subway or the metro or the train or in a car next to us. â€ Divorce can be seen on Sky Atlantic from October 11.",282,846,"983556876423061506	983562862554730496	983571550522654720	983574268188426240	983576885853433856	983583938215018497	983588920490209281	983604581010731008	983610719873748992	983628867775746048	983645054798565377	983652000305856512	983652143637774336	983656422704545792	983657775963127809	983660404147736576	983663000119861248	983664282964561920	983664877947547648	983664921849356288	983666570508500992	983666985987911680	983668498793512962	983676168258793472	983676183010336768	983684719446495232	983689374515818496	983689577352351744	983690144019599360	983694129799618560	983707824839684096	983707824768323584	983719868624064515	983721231663837184	983744036828835840	983746297281818624	983755267547557889	983755388947451905	983756932203806722	983758022639017984	983760370694270977	983760879639519234	983771394570768385	983776165151289344	983780790411538432	983781335327215618	983782485418037248	983783270973308933	983789325199409152	983790796729184257	983794668314836992	983800711983935488	983805445478469633	983808112778936322	983811241725612033	983815316001173505	983823623046737921	983826198286479361	983838347763204097	983839426924220417	983843927433216001	983862548276629504	983864057823457280	983873933819641856	983879323143868416	983884434008133633	983890157517574144	983892652893638656	983917058646831104	983923364485005313	983932051727433729	983939191145811969	983943572457119744	983945571185524737	983951464895827973	983951950860505088	983962994517463041	983966562783641600	983977901883297792	984022384784105473	984022544473837568	984043833745969152	984046068336857089	984052622759006208	984068921757261824	984070103963586560	984071592249569283	984080415718805504	984090193790734336	984090215718498304	984092735710879744	984095250669907968	984095682997968897	984102842242945025	984107913160556544	984111994503647232	984116648293650438	984116816397193216	984117169234612224	984117478614880257	984128309473800194	984129921898364928	984134612715794437	984167853724139522	984173773946437632	984181666041102337	984205450576105477	984253956741320704	984257723347996672	984271226922328064	984361584779776001	984366199470460928	984405311476912129	984413887968763905	984426095264108544	984430982521503744	984527487060262912	984757074574880768	984868004432408576	986788346394435585",fake
politifact15334,yournewswire.com/smallville-star-sold-children-rothschilds-clintons/,‘Smallville’ Star Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons,"With his second    endeavor, The   Adam Sandler has found a way to warp time. No, the story does not offer useful guidelines on how one can revert to oneâ€™s youth, as the title suggests, but creates a set and setting in which time magically moves at a fraction of the normal rate. Surely this movie must be almost over, you think, as you jab the pause button on your remote  â€”   only to find you are at the   mark with another 58 to go. Itâ€™s a remarkable feat, as so little else in this picture has anything noteworthy happening at all. It starts out simple, but moderately amusing. Charlie McMillan (David Spade) is a milquetoast loser who bumps into his old, cooler friend Max Kessler (Sandler) at a high school reunion. McMillan wears the same nerdy clothes and drives the same awful car and even holds the same humiliating job he did in high school: working in a bank inside a supermarket. (Old ladies ask him where they can find kitty litter. After explaining, again, that the bank is independent from the market, he sighs, reduced to his fate: aisle two.) McMillan is stuck in a rut. His faithless wife is still shacking up with her ex, but McMillan is raising their bratty twin sons. Kessler, a slightly toned down version of Sandlerâ€™s   jerk persona as seen in Thatâ€™s My Boy (a film some are brave enough to admit is not that bad) convinces McMillan to come hang out on his yacht one weekend. (Kessler works for the FBI, so heâ€™s got a boat. Why not?) After introducing a Bud Light Party Ball (â€œPut your ear next to it and you can still hear someone puking at a Def Leppard concert! â€) the pair unwind. A musical montage of fun includes shouting â€œShow us your tits!â€ to a neighboring boat of (in the parlance of the film) â€œhottiesâ€ who comply, then respond: â€œShow us your dick!â€ The ladies take one look at what McMillan is packing and shout â€œBoo!â€ so Kessler fires a flare at them, forcing them to dive overboard.  This is, depending on your point of view,     ribbing or gross male hostility. Whatever your decision, know this: it comes during the â€œgoodâ€   and   part of the movie. (Unlike director Steven Brillâ€™s last picture, the quite spry Blake   Elizabeth Banks vehicle Walk of Shame, The   becomes completely unraveled once things get complicated.) Kessler has a plan, you see. He blows up the boat, enabling the two to fake their own death. Wonâ€™t authorities look for bodies? They will but, as it turns out, Kessler doesnâ€™t work for the FBI  â€”   he is a coroner, and had access to two   corpses that no one will miss. Kessler and McMillan can assume their identities and start a new life. Kessler maxed out his credit cards and has enough dough for them to float for a while, but there was also a safety deposit box in the rectum of one of the two men, you see. This leads to an enormous cache of cash and the keys to a mansion in Puerto Rico. â€œThereâ€™s like five houses in this house!â€ McMillan (now called Dr Fishman) shouts with glee. On permanent vacation (â€œPlay Who Let The Dogs Out!â€ McMillan drunkenly suggests at a resort bar) thereâ€™s dancing and hookups, one of which involves a bit of homosexual panic when sweat from Luis GuzmÃ¡nâ€™s scrotum drips all over David Spadeâ€™s glasses. The gay jokes (and there are many) come encased in layers of â€œnot that thereâ€™s anything wrong with it!â€ disclaimers, but one has to wonder why this is such a recurring theme. Another source for yuks: libidinal geriatric RenÃ©e Taylor, whose topless scene will similarly land as either cruel or â€œall in good funâ€ depending on where your personal line is drawn. The frivolity comes to an end, though when an acrobatic German hitman comes calling. I mean, they are living in luxury in the Caribbean, clearly the men whose lives our heroes stole are involved in either drugs or weapons, so the second half of the movie becomes a     actioner. The plot, which now involves the real Dr Fishmanâ€™s widow (Paula Patton) is convoluted, but itâ€™s not worth worrying too much about. Itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re curing cancer. Oh, but they are! In a   reveal itâ€™s discovered that our two doofuses have stumbled into an enormous corporate conspiracy to repress a miracle cancer drug. No amount of shouting â€œdo over!â€ at the screen can turn the plot around, as it suddenly becomes a   thriller to save mankind. With Sandler and Spade. On a    budget. Despite an idiocy metastasized into the marrow of its script impervious to any radiation, there is, as with many of Sandlerâ€™s productions, at least something of an upbeat quality to its reprehensibility. While scoping out his own funeral he sees an Asian man. â€œMy dry cleaner showed up?â€ Itâ€™s a creaky, racist joke, but then thereâ€™s the  . â€œI didnâ€™t see that one coming,â€ he mumbles.

politifact15554,https://conservativepost.com/maxine-waters-is-getting-criminally-charged/,Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!,"On Thursday, HBO announced a new crop of standup specials to air next year, including hours from Jerrod Carmichael, Pete Holmes and TJ Miller. It comes only a few days after Netflix announced the imminent release of eight new specials, bringing the siteâ€™s total to over two dozen for 2016. Comics include current Saturday Night Live star Michael Che and former SNL star Dana Carvey. This fall will also see a new special from Martin Lawrence on Showtime, his first in 14 years, and a Doug Stanhope hour on NBCâ€™s newish streaming service, Seeso. HBO and Showtime have been producing specials for years, and theyâ€™ve become a major focus for both Netflix and Seeso, and for good reason. Theyâ€™re relatively cheap to produce, attract a young male audience who advertisers covet, and can stay popular for years. And while the prestige of TV lingers, the really important thing is making them available online comics want their material available for new fans to discover. For younger comics, streaming sites increasingly serve as archives of old material (most of Aziz Ansariâ€™s back catalog can be found on Netflix). Not so long ago, doing regular comedy specials was for the privileged few  â€”   George Carlinâ€™s annual HBO specials were a sign of his exalted status. For a rising comic, doing a special is a sign of arriving â€œgetting an hourâ€ signals that you have some degree of talent, fame and bankability. This is mostly due to the way US comics put together material. In the UK, a comedianâ€™s year revolves around producing a show for the Edinburgh Fringe in August, while in Australia, a comic is likely to work toward an hour for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in March. No such central festival exists in the States comedians build up materially slowly through short sets, spinning them into longer routines as they tour around the country. Without a specific deadline to submit a show, material gets honed tighter and tighter over the years, and a special every two to three years is common for most successful comedians. There are, of course, exceptions  â€”   Louis CK has attempted an hour ever year for the past decade. Generally, comedians with looser, more conversational material churn them out more frequently, while precise, dense writers tend to wait longer  â€”   Steven Wright, the king of   has released only two specials in his   career. And for most comics, recording a special means putting that material to bed. Itâ€™s spent it can never be done again on television, and those jokes are phased out of live performances. Thatâ€™s why, for some very successful touring comedians, recording a special holds little appeal. Jerry Seinfeld hasnâ€™t recorded a special since 1998â€™s Iâ€™m Telling You for the Last Time, but heâ€™s been performing standup regularly since then. During his recent run of NYC shows, he told stories about his children as toddlers, even though theyâ€™re now teenagers, a sign that those jokes were probably a decade old. But it doesnâ€™t matter he can keep telling them as he tours the country, and the odds are that most of his audience wonâ€™t have heard them.  Lawrence, on the other hand, has good reason to invest his time in a special. Fresh from a nationwide arena tour, heâ€™ll soon be promoting the third Bad Boys movie, set for a 2018 release, and heâ€™ll be hoping to revive the fanbase he built as a popular standup and sitcom star in the 1990s. With his special on rotation at Showtime, he can prove his relevance in modern comedy.  Some have criticized Netflix for not including more women, but thereâ€™s also narrowness to their ages Che is the only comic on the list under 40. It may be that younger comics are drawn more toward television specials, which allow them to build relationships with networks that could lead to more work, or to producing albums with smaller labels like A Special Thing and Rooftop Comedy, which give them the option of selling CDs as merchandise.  There is now more standup available online than anyone could possibly consume, and while some of itâ€™s excellent, devout comedy fans will know that, when the last comedy boom died in the early 90s, many blamed the proliferation of free standup on television for diluting the product and discouraging people from going out to live shows. Itâ€™s too early to say whether the expansion of streaming content will have the same effect, but when more than 10 new standup specials are announced in the same week, it certainly seems plausible.

The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, received his briefing earlier this month, a customary move for major party nominees but one that has been the subject of a political tussle during the campaign. Some critics and opponents of Trump have questioned whether he is capable of handling sensitive information responsibly some of Clintonâ€™s critics say her use of a private email server while secretary of state raises concern over her ability to protect classified information. Clinton attended her briefing for more than two hours at the FBI office in White Plains, New York, near her suburban home. As Barack Obamaâ€™s secretary of state, she held a high security clearance and received a copy of the presidentâ€™s daily brief, the   US intelligence document that includes sensitive intelligence and analysis from around the world. Saturdayâ€™s briefing was her first since becoming her partyâ€™s nominee and no aides were present, her campaign said. Trump was accompanied to his briefing by retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn and New Jersey governor Chris Christie. The briefings, which are delivered by career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, have been traditional for presidential nominees for more than 60 years, to ensure a smooth transition for the next commander in chief.  Trump was campaigning on Saturday, headlining the Republican senator Joni Ernstâ€™s annual â€œRoast and Rideâ€ fundraiser at the Iowa state fairgrounds in Des Moines. The businessman was not planning to join a   motorcycle ride that is part of the event but nonetheless brought his campaign to a state where polls show a tight contest, rare good news for Republicans in battleground states. In an interview with the Associated Press, Iowaâ€™s Republican governor, Terry Branstad, said he would like Trump to focus his message more on a renewable fuel standard that is important to his stateâ€™s corn farmers. Trump and Clinton are polling â€œabout evenâ€ in the state, Branstad said, adding that he would like Trump to launch campaign ads in Iowa since Clinton has already done so. â€œI donâ€™t like that, but hopefully thatâ€™s going to change,â€ he
